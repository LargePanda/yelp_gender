My first time here, and I will be back. Fabulous massage from Lisa. I asked for I hr foot massage which is $22. She added hot stones which is an extra $4, then $4 back massage hands and stone. I believe it was well over 1hr1/2 for $30! Gave her a well deserved $15 tip :) 

Pleasant surprise. I will recommend. I went here for the first time 2 weeks ago.  I scheduled an appointment the morning of and was surprised they had openings.  Very nice and accommodating.  When I arrived, they were ready for me (that doesn't always happen at nail salons since they get a lot of walk-ins and never turn them down). 

I had a gel nail manicure and a lip wax. Overall the experience was good. The nail technician did both services. She was nice and friendly enough. Did a nice job on the manicure. It lasted a good too weeks. No chips or dents. No problems on the wax Quick and painless. 

They did try to upsell me on a massage while I was sitting in the manicure chair. I thought it was free added perk, but was an extra $20.  She was not upfront about the cost and just started putting my hair up to get started on the massage. I then had to ask her if this was part of service or extra, she then told me it was an extra $20. Very deceiving. BEWARE!. Although Yelp is more for food reviews, I had to review this tire place because they did a phenomenal job today.  I needed new tires, and for Christmas I decided to get the rims I always wanted.  I saw that this tire place had a 4.5 star rating, so I headed on over early in the morning.  

They greeted me with elf hats on and a candy cane, which, for the season, was quite appropriate (and humorous).  They took a look at my tires, measured my tread right there, and told me what I needed to get and the time frame I could wait before changing them.  I decided to get the tires today, so they walked me in, gave me at least three choices of tires, explaining their shelf lives and prices.  I decided to get the middle priced tires and the rims on sale, which they packaged in a deal for me.  I saved about 100 bucks that way, but in total they were still around 950 for the entire service package (tax included).   I really didn't care about the cost because these guys are well worth it.  They clean--and I mean CLEAN--the entire floor, from the crevices between railings to the tops of the warehouse racks.  It was amazing how pristine this place is.  They only took 30 minutes to do the entire job, and they even shined up my tires. While sipping on free cocoa and chewing on a candy cane, it was nice to watch them do the job.  

I love that their inventory is good and that their prices are competitive.  You must go here when you want to change your tires, too!  Russell is a doll!. Great location, convenient to retail, the freeway and our neighborhood. 

I have had great luck at this location. They are child-friendly, and have always managed to find a spot for us away from bar (at our request) so the kiddos don't bother anyone.

The selection is great on both the adult and kids menus. The staff is friendly, engaging with the kids and always refilling he drinks.. While visiting the Charlotte area, I did a quick search on trip advisor. I came across Exit Strategy it look like a lot of fun and something our entire family would enjoy.  After reading about the different rooms we agreed they the "70's" room was the most suitable for us.  We were joined by Three others, strangers for only a few moments.   A soon as the door closed we all became A team.  The age difference was beneficial.  Little people and big people putting their minds together to solve the clues and find the key to escape.   Time flew by and I think we were all up for another challenge as soon as we finished.  
I thought it was a little pricey, it a great activity for a family but 25 for adults and 1/2 price for children makes it more of a special occasion outing.  

However as soon as we got into the car the kids were looking for similar places close to home.   We had a great time. I love this park. We used to go every year as a family. Now I take my own, they have great wooden coasters, water rides and plenty of shade to relax under. They also have a very large kiddie land. I love all of the older rides like the turtles and noah's ark, so much charm! Defintley stay late to see them all light up at night. Go on a weekday to avoid the crowds. I last went on a Friday and didn't have to wait any longer than 20 minutes for any ride. A great time was had by all. I just can't wait until the old mill isn't a 3D Garfield ride anymore-that one was a heart breaker...I fondly remember the old mill of my youth! The food is amazing, super delish and greasy potatoe patch fries covered in cheese and real bacon, bring the pepto! Fresh corn dogs, dip n dots, and of course I never leave with out some chocolate walnut fudge at the end of the night. Johnny Rockets was closed due to the kitchen being too busy or something so I can't review it, we had our dinner at the Cafe on the porch, it was lovely.. Yelped out for what was nearby and found this place.  It's in a shopping plaza and just a little restaurant.  I ordered a gyro salad and small fry (shhh...!) The salad was bomb bomb bomb diggity no doubt!! I ate my entire salad and actually threw most of the fries away because I was so full from my fresh, flavorful salad.  The salad came with shredded iceberg, Lamb meat, one pepperoncini ( would have appreciated more), tomatoes, red peppers, red onions, and cucumbers.  It was lovely.  I am thankful I yelped the "around me" option to find this family owned spot.. Freshly baked bread. Honey-glazed chocolate croissants. Freshly sliced proscuitto all wrapped up in lovely paper packets. Extra Virgin Olive Oil. If I could live on these four items for the rest of my life, and they were from Andreolis, I would. 

This restaurant is set up a bit like a high-end deli, where you can order freshly made pastries and breads, cheeses, meats (I've heard rumor that Gianni cures his own salami...ask), olives and stock up on hard to find Italian grocery items. I always stop here when I'm on my way to picnic at the Northern Arizona wineries. However, you can also order full meals brought to a table in a rustic dining room that feels like home. The patatine e porri fritti (fried potatoes and leeks) is one of my favorite things on the menu. Purchase a bottle of white wine or a bottle of bubbly Italian soda, and you're good to go. If you speak Italian, you'll feel right at home. Everyone here does. 

It also doesn't hurt that there's an urban legend that Chris Bianco worked for Gianni Andreoli a long time ago in a land far, far away. (Babbo Ganzo in Santa Fe.) 

Enjoy!. I Love Sushi is one of my favorite places to go when I am not wanting to do "all you can eat."  The menu offers a lot of choices.  My personal favorite is the "What's Your Name?" roll.  It's delish!  I took a friend who had never tried sushi before there, and she was hooked! The atmosphere is nice, the staff is friendly, and service is quick.  Some reviews have said to avoid it during peak hours, but I have been there for dinner several times, and I don't recall ever having to wait more than a couple minutes.. Dazzling Bistro is awesome. Their food is spectacular and they are an awesome crew.  Chef Darnell is outgoing and we just love eating there.. I love the Beatles so I was really excited to see this show. I was not disappointed in the least. I was really impressed by the interpretation of the Beatles songs and the costumes, staging, acoustics, and props were all spectacular. The stage was set up in-the-round so that everyone had a decent view of the stage, and speakers were attached to the heads of each seat for the optimal listening experience. One cool thing that was used in the show were voice recordings of the Beatles talking in the studio. It really showed how much the boys must have had while recording. 

Songs that stood out: Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, For the Benefit of Mr. Kite, and Flying/Blue Jay Way? (forgot which one, or both since the tracks were remixed) 

If you have seen Cirque shows before, however, you may be disappointed in the variety of the acts. While they did some other acts, the show seemed really dance and rope-acrobatics heavy. 

Overall, this show was outstanding. It exceed my expectations, and I would recommend it to anyone going to Vegas.. LOVE LOVE LOVE Green! I would easily become a vegetarian if I could afford to eat here for every meal forever. The mock chicken is fantastic, I can't get enough of it, the texture is amazing. I like it way better than actual chicken, no other mock chicken can compare. Try the buffalo wings, samosas, krab puffs and curry with mock chicken, TRY EVERYTHING. And don't forget the vimto! Then head next door for some delicious pastries and tsoynamis!. I see Donna McDonald for my color and cut. She does exactly what I want! I love it every time whether it is highlights, all over color or a cut. The salon itself is very cute and clean. The front desk staff are very nice and friendly, they also call to remind you of your appt which is nice. I have not worked with the other stylist but they always seem busy. I would def recommend Donna McDonald though!. My husband and I stayed here over the holidays as we were visiting family and needed a private retreat to escape to at the end of the day...This place is such the decadence!  Of course there's a price for that but sometimes you just got to treat yourself.  It was also my birthday that week and my husband had made mention of it when booking our reservations..  We arrived about 1:00 in the afternoon..just driving up through the gates are a treat in itself..beautiful landscaping and there is the hotel set up against Camelback Mountain.   You have to stop at a guard who asks you if your checking in and you tell him your name and are let thru.  We decided to do self parking instead of valet because paying 39 dollars a day is not how I want to spend the enormous amount of money I knew I'd be spending on better things like the spa, restaurants, drinks.
The lobby is so spacious with marble floors, fountain and lots of windows to view the scenery.  Check in was very fast..the guard must let the front desk know your here as they as our room keys were all ready to go!  When we got to our room I was so happy on how big and modern the decor was..  It's a 600 sq, foot room with a double sided sliding glass which opens to this huge balcony with two chairs, a table and a long lounge chair..  We had got the highest floor (4th) with a pool view..ask for that if you ever go as it's the premium view..
There was a bottle of champagne chilling on ice with two glasses (compliments of the hotel) for my birthday and a card welcoming us.  The bathrooms are all done in marble with a sunken tub, full sized tolietries from their spa (Eucalyptus/grapefruit) and two big fluffy robes hanging up next to the tub.  A CD was playing some classical music, I guess to set the mood for the elegance and I'll tell you, I did not want to leave the room EVER!  
We ate a few times at "The Terrace" which you had a choice of indoor or outdoor dining.  great food and excellent service.. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the many families with a lot of kids who dined there..very noisy at times..but then my husband and I are child free by choice so I guess we get a little grumpy when we are around misbehaving kids.  They also have a lounge and at night you can sit out on a high overlook, with fire pits for a chilly Arizona night and have some very tasty cocktails..  We also used the spa one day, my husband had a massage and I just used their sauna, steam room, whirlpool and the meditation garden sipping some herbal teas..I loved it!  They have over 5 pools scattered around the place, at night we went swimming and then used their enormous hot tub!  I can't wait to go back to this place..it's worth the extra money to be treated well, and to have a relaxing time.... Bring your A game and your wallet, my friends! Great hip hop club. Everyone dresses to the 9s and the DJs are awesome. Playing top hits, fantastic lights and visuals, dancers, rooftop bar, etc. The outdoor rooftop bar area was closed when we went there - I suppose bc of the pool and the fact that it was 50 degrees out, but I'm from the east coast so it didn't feel cold to me at all. Drinks were expensive as anything (2 mixed drinks $30) so I'd definitely pregame, but if a great club is what you're looking for then it's worth it. Try and keep an ear out for promoters on the strip nearby - they can offer free cover. Otherwise it's $20-40 to get in depending on night and gender. I'll definitely be back here though next time I'm in Vegas!. Best pizza I have had in a long time! The garlic balls were extra delicious too. We will definitely be returning! It cost me as much here as it does to go to the $5 pizza joint that I am sick of!  I ordered directly from yelp too which was extra convenient! 
We all got full on one slice too ! Yum!!. First time there this past weekend and now an official fan! Meat is delicious there, priced fair and such a wide variety! Only thing I can say negative is the size of the actual customer area...it was so crowded in there I couldn't breathe! But it didn't seem to bother anyone, it was full so they're doing something right!. 4.5 stars-- why aren't there half stars??!!

C4 was really good.  I had the bacon cheese burger and it was cooked to my exact request.  My dinner guests had the chorizo mac n cheese and that was really really good!  We had the appetizer of the chips and 3 dips, this was a bit lacking in taste.  I wanted to try the crab cakes, I should have.

Dessert was the lemon TART-- let me put an emphasis on the TART part, it was very very tart.  Not my thing, but it was my guests thing, they really liked it.  We also tried the bread pudding-- this was very tasty and we enjoyed it.

Our server, Shannon, was nice.  She had obviously tried the food and was able to talk about all the items on the menu.  This was nice to hear.    We went around 6:30 and it was quiet but by the time we were done, there were many other diners in the restaurant.

After our yummy dinner we went up to the rooftop to take a look, it is really really cool!  I am so looking forward to having some drinks up there very soon in the awesome weather we are having right now.

The pool area is beautiful, it looks like something out of a movie.  

We had a chance to talk with Ben, he is personable, knowledgeable about he hotel, he was very open and honest-- we liked him.  Got a good vibe off him.

Planning on coming back and bring the friends with for some good food, drinks and atmosphere.. This salon is fun and funky! Megan Roth cuts and colors my hair and she is by far the best stylist I have encountered in Phoenix over the last ten years ( and i have been to many so called upscale Scottdale salons) Megan is qualified and will not overcharge you, she will be on time and give you a great haircut! Go see Megan!. I was a little disappointed to find that there is no stand alone Chanel store in AZ so I had no choice but to go to Neiman to find my next Chanel bag.  I must say, they have an excellent staff here.  The bag I wanted to see was not in stock so they had it brought over from a store in TX so that I could check it out.  The sales associate texted me to let me know the status (when it was shipped, ETA, and when it arrived).  When I went back down to see the bag I wasn't impressed - they didn't skip a beat or act like it was the end of the world that I didn't want the bag after they had gone through the trouble of bringing it over.  I found another bag that I loved but they didn't have the color I wanted in stock so they ordered it for me and shipped it to the house (Fed Ex - no charge).

This boutique is bigger than others I've been in which was a nice surprise.  I won't hesitate to come back for my next bag, I guess I didn't need the stand alone Chanel store after all!. Amazing I love my nails they are perfect and the workers are super nice luv luv luv this place. After looking around the Galleria Mall, I stopped by Thelma's Filipino Restaurant to get a hearty meal.. and a hearty delicious meal is what I received. Location is right across the street from the mall itself and nearby Sunset Station casino. I missed my friend's Father cooking homemade Chicken Adobo and Pork Gisantes.. oh the aroma that filled the room as he cooked these dishes. I woke up to this every time I slept over at her place. One of many reasons why I loved spending a night there :P So sometimes I have cravings for something sour, sweet, and tangy all in one visit. This place is just what I needed. 

I loved the dining area... so spacious and clean. The light green colored walls and wooden chairs gave this place such an cool, soft ambiance... I couldn't help but think I was in Hawaii or somewhere tropical. I enjoyed sitting by the window and having the sun rest on my face. Nice to look out and enjoy a beautiful day!!! 
I ordered a mixed plate of the choice of two.... I chose the one scoop of rice and mac salad with two entrees of the Pork Gisantes and Chicken Adobo. When the plate arrived, it had a wonderful fragrant, color, and looked so tasty!!! It was one huge chicken piece for the Chicken Adobo and the meat was so tender that you wouldn't even need a knife to cut it. All I had to do was peel the meat off with my fork. Juicy and a burst of flavor... it had a small acidic bite, but the sauce was so delicious with rice. The Pork Gisantes had chunks of meat, green peas and green bell peppers. The meat had a few chunks of fat too, but it contributes to the flavor of the dish, so I didn't mind at all. The sauces from both dishes were wonderful to taste...  It was a combination of sweetness and sour. I asked for the condiments and added some vinegar/garlic sauce to the Pork Gisantes, because I like to go a little extreme on the sour side. Maybe too much..  where you coat your whole tongue full of vinegar!!! I love it! 

After I finished everything... I always loved the Filipino dessert... Halo Halo! So I ordered their Halo Halo Special that came with Macapuno Ube(Young Coconut Purple Yam) ice cream! YUM. They serve it to you in a glass bowl with two scoops of ice cream and a piece of leche flan on top of crushed ice. Underneath the ice is where all the goodies are placed. Sugar palm fruit, jackfruit, nata de coco (chewy, jelly-like), and sweet beans are all mixed together to enjoy. It's topped off with some toasted crushed young rice and it's a wonderful treat to have after a tangy, hearty meal. And also you can sip it like a drink when you ate everything and all the ice has melted. So delicious and revitalizing to the senses!!! 

Service was very friendly and helpful. Although I don't eat much Filipino cuisine, I do love it every time I come here. Brings back good old memories and flavors I missed during my childhood. Their chicken adobo was very close in how my friend's father used to make it. Tantalizing aromas and flavorful dishes awaits for you at Thelma's Filipino Restaurant.. Schaffer's is a great bridal salon. The store is big & clean and has huge dressing rooms. They carry a bunch of different wedding dress designers like Maggie Sottero, Pronovias, Sottero & Midgley, and Marchesa. The lady who helped me try on gowns, Karla, was great! She took the time to understand what I was looking for and pulled a great assortment of dresses in my price range. I would highly recommend Schaffer's to brides looking for wedding dresses.. Good sushi and good prices. Small family enviornment and the taste is worth the wait. Sushi is made fresh and tastes great!. One of the most beautiful hotels not only in Vegas, but in the world! Also, did you know that the Palazzo is the 6th largest building in the world in terms of available ground space? My feet definitely felt it..

I love the sunken living room and the gorgeous, large bathroom. Everything feels so luxurious and you definitely get what you pay for. I've never shopped in the "Shoppes" because I can't afford it, but its fun to window shop :) The casino floor is spacious, and the restaurants and entertainment the hotel has to offer are top notch.. I've been getting my hair done by Gwen for years! I love this place. Both girls are super talented! Gwen will do exactly what you want or give you ideas if you're not sure. I always get color and a cut. I won't ever go anywhere else. And don't forget, you can bring the whole family, men's and kids hair too!. We came for the pizza, but there are also salads and pasta dishes on the menu. Our pizzas were delicious! I tried the BBQ Chicken and my BF got the Meatlovers. We also tried the Fried Mozzarella, which is delicately fried fresh mozzarella. Yum! 
I'm giving four stars because it was a loud atmosphere during the dinner rush, and the waitress gave my BF the wrong drink.. I've been here a couple times and I always enjoy the different ceviches and appetizers we order- never tried one that I didn't like. Also their bread rolls and butter are really good. A different bread taste than most are used to but I like that it's unique. Just as a heads up, their drinks are very small for the price you pay for each. Their main entrees are delicious, I love their sea bass. My boyfriend always get this steak/crab combo that I've tried and it's reeeeally good. I did try the lamb once but I was not a fan. Service is excellent, knowledgable, and attentive.. Very local orientated place.  Starting playing here the past few weeks and I already got comps for this month. Their Medley Buffet is really something, i mean it makes Red Rock taste like garbage.  I always find myself amazed at all the flavors and how the staff really care about their jobs.  Even the slot attendants were nice when I asked  if they had a certain game I was wanting to play (Shaman's Magic).

what really strikes me, the wonderful hotel check in & valet service.  Even smells amazing when you go in the hotel.  I hate staying somewhere that stinks of cigars.  I was really amazed at how clean & beautiful this place is.. was looking for a Close Nail shop to my house. I went here because of the 5 star review and I know why now. They were awesome! Tons of colors, very modern and airy atmosphere. The people spoke English even to each other. They will do any design you ask and have a bunch to Choose from on Instagram and Facebook. Highly recommended. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum.

A great, authentic alternative to waiting in line at the greatest tourist trap of all, Schwartz's! (Don't get me wrong, they make fantastic smoked meat, but I'm not down with the line up and exaggerated hype) Bernard is also one of my favourite streets to stroll on, it just has so much to offer. Start off with a coffee or a bite to eat, then grab an ice cream and people watch. Especially on a beautiful, summer day, you just can't go wrong.

The traditional smoked meat came out soft and not-so-fatty. The rye was fresh and fluffy. The fries were AH-MAH-ZING, especially drizzled with some vinegar. And you can never forget the side of a good ol' pickle. I didn't opt for the Cherry Coke, I know... my b. The service was fantastic and so accommodating, our waitress even offered my dog a little bowl of water and tons of love and affection. We sat outside and just enjoyed the wonderful day that it was, while the outstanding service and finger-lickin' good food topped it off marvelously.

Heaven in your mouth, go for it.. Good food and great atmosphere.  Service was nice and it was a gorgeous day for a regatta!. I live in the local community and love Boa.  First & foremost, Scott the owner is there most nights and creates an inviting and connected space for his patrons.  The knowledgeable staff  are good looking, friendly and always anticipating our needs. The outside patio is lovely with the ambient lights and live music.  The bar has been remodeled as of recent and the new chef is fabulous!  I highly recommend this restaurant for food, drinks, wine list and local residents.. I'm not sure if it's even fair to review Craftsteak, as I had breakfast while with a private party and I later found out, they don't even serve breakfast. All I can say is that the food was delicious (and great hangover food, to boot).  If you ever see their bread pudding on the dessert menu, order it without hesitation. And I say this as a person who doesn't like bread pudding or raisins for that matter, but this was still amazing.  If the food on the dinner menu is even half as good as breakfast, Craftsteak is sure bet. Pun intended.. OMGosh!  This place rocks!  Healthy pizza?  It's like Subway but for pizza.  Pick what you want and watch them pile it on.  One price!  So worth it.  Come taste a mouthful of YUM!. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! First off, It's completely reasonably priced. I ordered the ten inch Mediterranean pizza and it was 9 dollars, and for the quality I thought that was great. Our waitress was this cute little thing and she was so nice and so down to earth. 

And the food was so good, I most definitely coming back. It's odd that people don't give this a high rating because I thought it was great.. Trails for all levels of hiking. Great views. I learned to love the desert landscape of Arizona after hiking here.  it's beautiful and challenging.. Amazing gelato! My aunt came from Texas and wanted to try this place she heard thru a friend and definitely worth it . We got baileys ,tiramasu, and chocolate flavors and all very good creamy and very rich in flavor. The line went by fast and the cashier was very friendly. Try it out if your at the strip and want a little something to cool off .. MEAT LOVERS GALORE!! a place to definitely satisfy your inner carnivorous nature 

A couple friends and I ventured off of the strip to try this place out, heard of it through my baby cousin who goes to UNLV! 

Compared to NY prices, this place was a steal. it was 35$ for all you can eat lunch (in NY its 65$). AND IT TASTED SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE NY ONE!

Servers here are thebomb.com, super helpful and always asked if we wanted to request anything + how we liked our meat to be cooked. Can't get any better than that!!! customization to its finest :-) especially for an all you can eat place where you usually get what you're given. 

Recommendations: 
skip the salad bar, just eat the meat!! good selection though if you can eat that much... prosciutto 

only go to the salad bar to get your DIPPING SAUCES for the meat!! DONT FORGET THE THIS! 

sirloin- BEST SIRLOIN ever! perfectly medium rare, juicy- melt in your mouth sirloin:-)
lamb racks- I could not stop eating these, SO good! perfectly cooked and marinated and no gamey- taste to it. 

CHEESE BALLS! - as good as these are, try not to eat more than 2... you will ruin your appetite for MEAT! which, you know, is the main attraction.

FIVE STARS:
for excellent service
for food
for atmosphere + cleanliness
for price
for being in vegas. not on the strip. :-). Love this place and sushi chef Mike.  He makes the best Tekka Maki (Tuna Roll) in town!  Many all-you-can-eat places use cheap products, but not here.  The quality is great.  The service is also excellent.  Even though we only go there about once a month, they always remember us and bring us our correct drink order.  The only downside is the wait for dinner can be very long.. Fresh and Easy is pretty awesome. You're in, you're out and they usually have just what you need. Not too mention the CONSISTENTLY good pricing on meat, milk, and bread.

They have great coupons that come through the mail or in the paper. They're clean and friendly. 

Now this particular location doesn't seem to be as friendly as the one out in Tempe. Usually at Tempe, the workers are ALWAYS going above and beyond for the customers, including giving you a discount if you forgot or didn't have a coupon. 

This location is great, but they stepping up the customer service couldn't hurt. :). I went to this bar/pub knowing absolutely nothing about it at all. I'm not from The Edinburgh so I'm not familiar with many of the bars/pubs there. 
Stumbled across this place when through for the festival this year to see Tim Vine (who was very funny btw). We left quite early for Edinburgh so by the time our show had finished we were well ready for eats. 

This place clearly specialises in Beer and Burgers - 2 things I like rather a lot. From what I gather this is a fairly new bar but it has already been nominated for the DRAM Awards Best New Bar. S'nice. 

Myself and my boy quickly got a table - it was messy when we sat down but with it being the Festival season and just past the lunch rush we excused this. We helped ourselves to menus and in the meantime our table was quickly cleaned and cleared anyway and the polite waitress then asked us if we would like any drinks. This is a bit of a bug-bear of mine - you've only JUST sat down/looked at the menu and straight away you're asked what drink you would like. This would be FINE if I was a predictable drinker (have the same drink everywhere) but I am not; I like to try new things and everyday, depending on how I feel, it depends on what I drink. This day I was very thirsty and therefore very glad to see the extensive draught beer menu - at least 19 beers I spotted! Wowzer! Because I was rushed I picked a beer that wouldn't have been my 1st choice had I been given more time to look. Oof. ANYWAY, I digress - I chose a pint of West St.Mungo lager (had it before, really like it) Now I don't know if I imagined this but I swore I seen Brooklyn Lager on the menu after I had already ordered and I do *love* a pint of Brooklyn so I was kicking myself that I had felt rushed into ordering. Dang. 

Service was swift - the waitress that brought our drinks also then took our food order. This place specialises in quality burgers of all kinds. But fear not my vegetable loving friends! They DO cater for the veggies - with 4 types of veggie burgers on their menu amongst other non-animal dishes too. Also on their menu was tasty sounding breakfasts (only served til 12 Noon though...not very good for us late risers), various salads (who orders a salad when there's burgers on the menu?!) and other types of meaty sarnies. 

I opted for the (unadventurous) Cheese Burger and my boy ordered the Cheese and Bacon Burger. Both arrived swiftly and made my eyes go 'BOOOIIIINNNGGG!' like in the cartoons of old. Our HUGE burgers came on a wooden slab to make us feel even more Paleolithic-like (Ug!) and served alongside were lovely skinny crisp fries and a wee bowl of fancy coleslaw. Also in the burger was a delicious beer mustard mayo and the usual dill pickle, lettuce and tomato. I had to halve my BEAST BURGER coz being a dainty fingered lady (Ha ha) I could not handle that cow sandwich all in one go. 

All was very tasty and along with the beer I was one very satisfied lady indeed. After eating I thought in my wee head wouldn't it be grand to have a bar like this in Glasgow. There most probably is one but I've not came across it yet. 

Only downside was the teeny-tiny ladies toilets. Made me feel like a giant and when a place serves such good burgers they cannot expect all their lady patrons to be the size of Victoria Beckham. Boo and hoo. 

I would most definitely go back to The Holyrood 9A and next time try another good beer and another mammoth burger (not *actually* made with mammoth).. A quaint little showroom bar in the Tuscany Hotel & Casino. Plenty of oversized comfy lounge chairs.

On Friday nights, Kenny Davidson take over the joint (10 PM - 2 AM). He has singers from a variety of Vegas shows take the stage. This is one of the best free shows in Vegas! No cover and cheap drinks. There is a little bar tucked in the corner and the bar tender is from New Orleans and made me some really fun, down home drinks. This lounge was not overly smokey.

Fun spot.. I had some issues with my car last week and had heard this Big O Tire location was the best! I was told to see Moe, and boy were they right! I went in and as soon as Moe came over he was all smiles. My car had been stalling over the past couple weeks, so Moe checked it, gave me the most reasonable price I can find, and fixed it that day. Efficiency is an understatement for that guy. It's hard to find a great mechanic is town, and I'm letting all you know, Moe at Big O Tires is the way to go! Thanks Moe! See you for my oil change in a couple months!. So glad I found Patricia!!! I love the fact that I can make appointment via text and once I get there she is very attentive as she does my gel manicure. She also lets you watch a movie and never rushes the job. I highly recommend her for manicures, the gel will last for literally months!!. This place should be getting more than 5 stars! My friend and I sat in the bar area and got there just in time for the flair bartending show (complete with a dj introducing the 3 bartenders in a "let's get ready to ruuuuuumble!" hyped up way).  The added bonus is if you're at the bar, at the end of the magnificent show, the bartender picks several ppl on his side (there are 3 sides) who he thinks were the loudest/funnest/whatever and they get one of the several shooters he just poured *for free*.  Then, as if this isn't cool enough, he'll also pour a Malibu-esque fruity liquor down your throat (while he's still standing on the bartop) if he really likes you! Talk about a great time!

I also had dinner in between two flair shows (they're about an hour and a half apart), and the Lanai Chicken Pasta is a definite winner.

Added bonus of the night: Our server thought that her service was lacking, and comp'd 2 of our drinks that we ordered from her!! SWEET!

Sure, it's tacky, but they definitely aren't trying to hide anything. One of the funnest nights I've ever had in Vegas, and I can't wait to go back to this place!. The guys over at Tobias Automotive are so helpful and friendly! As a woman I would always worry if auto repair places are being honest about what needs to be done with my car. With Tobias I never have to worry, they are always super honest!! I will never take my car anywhere else!. Draught is a great place to get local craft beer and delicious food. There was live music set up outside that was fun to listen to, but not too loud that you couldn't hold a dinner conversation. 

We started with grilled wings with sauce made from OMB Copper and pork wings made with a cheer wine sauce. They both tasted delicious. They feature a lot of dishes with duck in them and a great build your own burger in which you can have a burger patty or a portabella cap. The Third Ward Special was very unique -- duke confit on a warmed roll with duck jus. It may taste gamey for some people's taste, but we really enjoyed it. 

We will definitely be going back to try more from the menu.. The boy and I were visiting his brother and sister-in-law who have recently moved to Pittsburg.  During our day-long visit to the Carnegie Museums, we decided to stop and have lunch here rather than wander the city looking for food.  

The boy had the steak sandwich, which he said was a little greasy, but yummy.  I had the petite salad and mushroom soup; it came with a cute little bread bun.  The salad was prettily presented, but the carrot curlicues were very challenging to eat gracefully.  The soup was very good, and the combo only cost $5!

We sat by the window, which presented a nice view of the fountain and the street.. I was delighted to find out that Jimmy Johns was in delivery distance to my job. After reading the reviews I was a little scared to order from this location. Twice! I have ordered twice in the past few days and both times I received exceptional customer service (the guy even laughed with me on the phone ..), delivery was FAST and friendly and Quality of food was perfect! 
No complaints here! I would recommend this location to anyone :). Honest, good people.  They could have easily taken advantage of me, but they didn't.  My Toyota dealership told me that I needed new brakes ASAP.  They got me all worried thinking that my brakes would fail at any moment.  To save money I took my car to Brakes Plus for my new brakes.  When they checked my cay, they said that I still have 60-70% of my brakes left and they were in good condition.  No need to replace.  They were as confused as I was as to why Right Toyota told me they were wasted.  Thanks, Brakes Plus! You've got my business when I DO need brakes for one of my cars.. I go here for waxing. Marina is awesome!  I have been her client for years and she is an expert at her job. She does wonderful threading as well. I have recommended her to others as well!. The hubby and I were on a quick, 4-night Vegas run when we discovered Ellis Island. Yeah, it's maybe not the best impression when you walk in the door: Uber-divey, with cigarette smoke laced with an vague, unpleasant, but (mercifully) unidentifiable stank. But trust me: stick around. Ellis is its own brewery, and you can get a REALLY good draft beer for dirt cheap. Play some blackjack. Play some slots. Watch the karaoke (or join in!), which ranges from horrific to Oh-my-God-this-person-should-have-his-own-variety-show fantastic. Then eat dinner (or, in our case, breakfast) in the joint's eatery: we got a NY strip and eggs for $5.99. And it was actually GOOD. Are you KIDDING ME?! Ellis Island is a MUST.. This place is great. Didn't eat, just drank, so can't comment on the food but our service was good, the patrons were friendly and the music (Solstice) was AWESOME! It's a bit cavernous and has somewhat low ceilings, so if that's not your thing you may prefer somewhere else on Cresent. For me it's pub nirvana. Thanks for a great night I'll never forget!. Granted, it's been years since my first (and only) visit to Zapata's, still a fave of my sister's who lives in the city, but this is the best place I've had AUTHENTIC sangria, outside of Madrid!  Yes, sliced and halved fruits steeped in good red wine, not fruit juices.  At least, that's how our sangria was served all those many years ago (late 90s or early 2000s).  I plan on asking her to take me here again on my next visit next month, so I might have an update!  :)  Stay cool!. So beautiful and really makes you feel like you got away from the city.  There is a wide variety of trails for all fitness levels.  
Very tranquil.. It is such a treat to go to Rudy's! Casual atmosphere and delicious food. I had to laugh at the other reviews who did not appreciate the rustic charm of Rudy's. It is San Antonio BBQ, for Pete's sake!  The turkey is to die for as is the pulled pork. We love the creamed corn and were pleasantly surprised with the beans on our last visit. We have tasted everything on the menu and it is all great.  Be sure to take a container of the pork green chili stew 'to go' and have it with eggs the next morning. Yummy!. Yummy!  Fresh and quick!  Was so good and quick service loved that I could take my whole family and we could just be in and out. Will definitely go again. I have heard stories about Planet Fitness but I love it here. The staff is more than friendly and they have everything I need in one spot. No complaints!. Super tiny beach club when you compare it to encore, there are only 2 tiny mini pools and the rest of it is hot pavement! Luckily the restrooms are clean

But why did I give this place a 4?

Simply because you can't beat dancing in the pool on a hot summer day.  

There was also a very nice promoter named Timothy who came by and generously poured libations into my open mouth and proceeded to offer me and my friends the hookups.  Needless to say we got entrances to clubs, bottles, tables, drinks, and even food comp'd by him and his friends

Basically going to Tao Beach made our weekend all the more great. I just got my septum done here, and am seriously impressed. The staff was thorough and knowledgeable and talked me through every step of the process. They have a better selection of jewelry than a lot of other shops I've been to and are reasonably priced at that. Quick, painless, and professional. I definitely recommend!. this may be the only place in scottsdale i would take out of scottsdale and relocate to somewhere close. it is that good, even with the chain shops and restaurants.. Great little pub away from all of the chaos of down the street. The menu holds lots of great items at a decent price. Service was fantastic. 

Get the Poutine - its delicious. Delicioso!  The bruschetta is a good starter - the bread toasted perfectly and not too thick.  We had the white tuscan bean with pancetta, roasted pepper with goat cheese, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, and Warm Artichoke Spread (you pick 4 to an order).  The prosciutto and artichoke were our definite faves.  The roast beef sandwich was good, but my Chicken & Mozzarella (on focaccia) and Raspberry Chicken Salad was SO good.. Went to the Steel Cactus event. Had such a blast! My friends and I will definitely be doing this again. The instructor was great and entertaining. Recommend this to all!. Very good bubble milk tea. I would like to see Thai ice tea and sesame bubble milk added to the menu, but still VERY good!. I was referred to Glam Lounge by a friend and added Andrea (employee and makeup artist extraordinaire) on Myspace. I looked through pictures of her work and was extremely impressed. Her models looked absolutely gorgeous and ethereal, without looking over-made up. She brought out their natural beauty without caking it on like, ahem, M.A.C. Being somewhat afraid of makeup, I knew immediately I had to book her for my wedding.

First of all, she traveled a hell of a long way to service my bridal party and myself. That was appreciated more than she'll ever know. Secondly, she was so friendly and made you her center of attention. I have had makeovers before and they just slap something on you, expecting you to feel beautiful/satisfied. Thirdly, I've never had my skin look so flawless. She made my blue eyes pop with the gorgeous chocolate shades she concocted. I have never felt or looked so gorgeous in all my life. I hate wearing lip color, but she applied the perfect color to complement my skin.

Thank you Glam Lounge! You have a client for life, thanks to the amazing look and feeling Andrea provided!!!. I'll give it 5 stars because
1.  I didn't wait in a long ass line, I just walked right in with my friend (our real tatas got us in, thank you Agent Provacteur)
2.  I had a great time dancing to the music
3.  No greasy guys were grinding up on me (I would have gone UFC on their ass!)
4. My friend left her panties in some one's pocket
5. I like that you're not trapped inside a box, so it was nice that you could see outside

Tryst was not what I expected it to be with all the hype surrounding it, but I had a great time.  Isn't that what it's all about?  Oh, and 6.  I received a very nice compliment from a female about my lap dancing skills...so thanks! (blush!). I was presently surprised to experience high quality Japanese food at Hagi Restaurant. My friend introduced me in June 2015.  I've been back 3 times in two months. I have ordered Chirashi A and Chirashi B. Those are exquisite! They use exceptionally fresh fish. Therefore, the combinations may be different time to time. I could not remember the last time I could not wait to return to the same restaurant. This place can be the best secret but I had to tell other sushi lovers.  
Please let everyone know: they are open for Lunch: Mon- Friday. Dinner: Tue- Sunday.  Closed on Mondays.. Always. Packed. 

Parking & getting out seems to be a hassle when it's rush hour but anything for beloved In-N-Out burger. :). Linda gave me a great pedicure and was super sweet.  She listened to the colors I wanted and used a picture I showed her to design my big toe flower.  See picture with blue polish and pink and yellow flower.  This is what my feet looked like after a month.  I got so many compliments for over a month.  Haha!  When I'm in town, I will go back.. Before going, reading the reviews that some people left made me not wanna go but since everyone in the family I was kind of forced to go. Either some of the reviewers went on a weekend or they are amazing at exaggerating. 

We went on a Monday and it was perfect! Easy to find, no problem with parking, $17 for tube and bus. The one thing the reviewers weren't wrong about was how rude some people were especially since some of them are older I would think they'd have some manners but NOPE. For a first timer, you obviously will have questions, they answer your questions as if you're stupid and repeat the same thing a billion times, NOT understanding the question you're asking. Anyways, after you get your tubes, the bus takes you to the drop off place where you'll start. 

It's a pretty chill and fun place especially when there aren't any drunk crazy people like the others had described, very nice and family friendly. The water was refreshing and cool. We took off from point 2 at about 12:45 and finished around 3 at point 4. There are some really slow parts and parts where the water takes you fast but it's nothing extreme. We also saw a few wild horses which was pretty cool! People said you'll get bruises and cuts from the rocks but my butt didn't even touch the rocks, just lift yourself up when you see the rocks. I'd recommend to take water shoes, hat, glasses (you won't lose these unless you're acting all crazy), you can take bed sheets to put around the tube so it doesn't get too hot or black marks all over you, water, and you can take an icebox too but we didn't take it and we were fine. 

After you finish the bus picks you up at point 4 and takes you back up where you return your tubes and they'll give you $7 off coupons for next time. 

Overall I think it was a good and fun experience! Had to knock off 1 star because of the attitude problems.. This place has the best cookies and customer service! Their staff is so nice and accommodating. Their cookies, all varieties, are absolutely amazing. I live in Chicago and have been to many bakeries and nothing compares to the Cookie Jar in Champaign. My favorite is the sugar cookie with icing. If you like any type of cookies/desserts you NEED to check out the Cookie Jar.. Nom nom. I haven't been to a really good Polish deli in a very long time- we are short on them in Ohio. However, on a recent trip to Pittsburgh- I found this place on the recommendation of fellow yelpers. I destroyed half of a pierogi platter (6 pierogis including cheddar and potato, farmers cheese and potato and kraut/mushroom). I was a fan. Add in the spunky little woman behind the counter, the beautiful day outside, the extremely reasonable price and this great little neighborhood (strip district)... and you are lucky I don't intend on becoming a permanent resident.. Super convenient, pretty much always open, and Mickey is always friendly even though he is ALWAYS there! Glad this place is right down the street from my house.. Absolutely love this place! One of the best pizzas I've ever tasted. Service was fast and the staff very friendly. You pick the toppings that you want so you really can't go wrong. I usually don't eat the crust, but I'd eat the Grimaldi's thin crust. Will definitely come back.. My parents, husband and I went to Cheeburger Cheeburger last week.  We've been there before so we knew what to expect this time.  The first time we went was information overload and we all ordered too many toppings.  There is every topping imaginable on the menu!  With too many toppings, our burgers all fell apart and we ended up eating them with our forks.  This time we focused on the good stuff!  I think we finished 2 medium orders of onion rings in world record time!  We were SO hungry and they tasted so wonderful!  Not too much breading and not too much grease...just the right amount!  The onion rings are definitely better than the fries.  We all agreed the burgers were better this time around.  There wasn't a morsel left on the table!  Their shakes are great and service is always friendly.  Only complaint...kind of random location. Otherwise, it's a fun place to try, especially if you like the 50's diner style music and atmosphere.. Holy Moses! Best BBQ in a looonnnggg time!! The cornbread is so good you don't even have to put butter on it! Fun atmosphere as well! oh...must say they have the best mac and cheese ever!!!  pulled pork...amazing, prime rib....scrumptious, roast beef...heaven! My family really loved it!. I LOVE Cheba Hut!!! I have tried half their menu and have yet to be disappointed. You don't need to be stoned to love these subs! They are all kinds of awesome.. First, I want to thank the owners of this location for an amazing deal.  My husband and I recently moved to the area and received a coupon in a 'Welcome Wagon' type package.  We had never been to YC's and may or may not have stopped in but with the coupon we figured we would give it a try.  We were so amazed and pleasantly surprised.  The food was exceptional and the gal that helped us was so sweet and answered our questions.  Since it was our first time in, we weren't sure how things worked, she patiently explained and helped us out.  After we had sat down with our food and were eating she came by to check on us.  Everything was delicious and we will be back many many times.  The value for what you get is amazing.  Thank you for a great experience with food and service!. I saw Dr. Hobgood last week for botox and he was great! His staff was really helpful and nice.  Not only was he one of the nicest doctors that I've been too, he was very knowledgeable! I've been to a few different places for Botox in the past, and it seems like a lot of them dilute it.  I am very happy with my results and I would highly recommend Dr. Hobgood if you want someone to give you the true amount of botox that you are paying for with excellent results! :). I love this hair salon! They are amazing here. I use Emma! She is the best. I love everything that she does to my hair.. Oh my gosh I love their steak tacos!!!  The only thing is the size.  They were so small u need about 5 to fill u up.  But they are soo good.  The cilantro, and the salsa yummy!  I will definitely be going back the next time I'm in town.. Had the pleasure of finding this hidden gem! Needed a quick appointment ASAP and Ellen was able to get me in the same day! She's quick and makes sure you're really comfortable! She takes great care of her clients. Did I mention she's quick?! Definitely check this place out for pool season!. Tgirls, trannys and some transsexuals meet here on Saturdays.  I went.  Sometimes there is a drag show.  I am not into the shows, but I do love to be with other tgirls.

Its more of a gay crowd, but they welcome everyone.. I am slightly OBSESSED with ChopShop! After moving back to Arizona from Texas I was sad to leave my favorite health food haunts behind, but ChopShop cheered my right up! The Green Glory is my favorite: think sweet green, spicy ginger and subtle kiwi. To die for. I love to pick up a couple sides of quinoa..it is the perfect portion for a quick go to in between meals. So happy I found this place!. Went to Fin before seeing LOVE. Really beautiful place, the food was delicious. We were four people and we ordered family style and shared. Everyone in the party enjoyed every last bite. We were full but still wanted to eat. We opted not to order dessert but they served us bailey's, pistachio cream shot which was soooo delicious. Also, their homemade fortune cookies were awesome. I would give this place a five star,  but most of the time none of us could understand the waiter. so that knocks off a star.

I would totally recommend it.. La taguara even though on a prominent street is a little hidden.  But once you find it its great.

So when we entered we were greeted by a guy, who asked us if we had ever been there. Upon hearing " No," he went on to explain the menu and it even has the favorites highlighted- very useful, and very friendly. 

You order and then take a seat. 

I started with the Sugar Cane juice- I was NOT a fan. It happens when you try a new cuisine, there are going to be things you do not like. It was still interesting, and you could tell well made. But that was the only thing that I did not like.

I tried tostones, a pork arepa, and a beef empanada. All delicious. Tostones- got to love fried plantains. Arepas is why you go to this place- not really available any where else. The beef empanada was not the kind I was use too it has a thicker almost bread like dough, but was still yummy.  But better than all of them was a green sauce that is served along with it- I could consume that my the gallons.

 I was with others who's dishes I picked at were incredible as well, some of tastings included: friend sweet plantains ( yum), crispy pork belly ( salty in a good way), and re fried beans ( best I have had). 

Overall I would go back there more often- if it was not such a haul for me living west of the capital. Its definitely worth one trip though.. Loved the fries! I ordered the kimchi fries and I also had a hot dog. I'm looking foward to trying something new next time. Friendly people and great food, I'll be going back :). Great service, with a fantastic view and ambiance. The lobster salad was perfect. Every ingredient complimented the dish very well. It was certainly tantalizing to our taste buds. We also had the duck and beef Wellington plate, as well as green beans and potato croquette for our sides which were all extremely well prepared as well. Jon Paul took very good care of us. He was personable, attentive, and good at anticipating needs in advance. He also gave us a complimentary anniversary dessert that was nice and a very good ending to our meal. This was my third visit here, and they never cease to impress. I am a Vegas local, so I'm sure I will be making another trip soon.. Love this quaint little place, out of the way of all the partier's and clubbers and 21 years old that can't hold their liquor and barf on bars. :)  I have been there a handful of times and never been disappointed by the staff or the drinks.. I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!

I was introduced to Taiko by a friend. After hearing me say so many times how I had not found a good sushi place to eat like in CA, she said it was a must I go with her. My friend is a regular and they made no exception towards me the first time I went. I saw how the owners knew everyone name that came in :).Every time I have gone in since my initial visit  Toshi and Maggie great me by name, even if a couple of months have passed by. Every friend I have taken Taiko returns on their own. I feel like I'm family when I am there. The staff is so attentive and willing to answer any questions. Sushi is always FRESH (I have gone to restaurants where I've been given still frozen fish).  It is a must to have their Miso soup. Once you place your order it does not take more that 15 minutes before you are served. In my experience, they get to know and remember what you order and make recommendations according to that. Their Happy Hour is amazing and full of different selections to make and inexpensive. I always leave there feeling like I ate at a family/friends house.. After doing our groceries, my sister and I stopped by to get something to eat. My sister had a hard time reading the menu and without hesitation the cashier Alexandra D. offered my sister her glasses. She took her glasses off and gave it to my sister so she can read the menu. She's awesome! That's the best customer service I've ever experienced!. One of the best Teriyaki Eel bowls I've had! Sushi was also delicious and Really Fresh. I'll be back!. Great addition to the neighbourhood. Warm, friendly athmosphere, amazing service and the food is awesome. There are many hot sauces to choose from, which I always love. Try the shrimp and grits.. I happen to LOVE the Bikini!  Went here the other night after my gig.  It was pretty empty (Wednesday night) UNTIL 11:30 when the place got a crowd.  I was wondering "Who the heck goes out this late on a Wednesday night?"
You know it's becoming something more popular when the parking lot is filled with Audis and Beemers.  
The bartender lady was a peach!  
I like the high-top tables.  Kind of retro-metal and they were clean.  You'd notice if they were dirty because of the sheen.  The booth we were in was HUGE and really comfy.  
The jukebox is pretty good, though they didn't have the Pantera I was looking for.  I don't think that's a Bikini fault, though.
I like the mixed crowd.  It reminds me of the old Jugheads.  All walks of life and really nice people to talk to.  When I can go up to a stranger at a bar and shoot the shit for a moment, it's a cool place.
Yeah, it may be a little stinky, but it's a DIVE BAR.. Great show! Great music! (The speed of their speech is a little fast though, so if you're an international student like me, there would probably be some lines that you don't understand completely.) And the song that I'm most familiar with is "Can't take my eyes off you".. Found this on Yelp and became an instant fan!  At the end of nowhere in the San Tan Valley area, you come across the big metal pig and know you're in the right place.  This tiny little shop was bursting with busy the entire time we were there.  On our first trip, we purchased the peppered bacon...among the best I've ever had, the jalapeño sausage...mmmm  mmmmm yummy, jalapeño brats and the pork sticks (snack sized smoked sausage in various flavors).  They were an instant hit and instant snack necessity.  The shop sells everything pork related... ribs, chops, hocks, steaks, roasts, sausages, bacon, ham, loins, sticks and lunch meat.  The quality and freshness of everything make it worth the drive and price.  Perfect for Bacon and Pork lovers!  On a side note, found out that The Deli (my favorite restaurant in the valley) purchases their pork here.  Its all coming together.... Good Customer service! Super Friendly. Love the chz rolls, malasadas and made to order meals! Worth coming back!. Since being new to the area, I have decided I love getting my pedi's done here.  Michelle is awesome.  I have tried a few places, she is the only one who takes time to get to know me, and offer advice about my foot care needs.  Love it here!. Thank you lovely ladies for getting me in and out quickly and doing a fantastic job! I made it to the birthday party in time and everyone loved my nails :). My favorite thing about Vegas I think :)

So yeah, some of the songs are a little dated (my heart will go on??? wtf?) but the fountains play so often, just stick around for the next one and hopefully it'll be a better song!

Best viewed at night I think. Even better from the Eiffel Tower observation deck at Paris. Just watch out for people trying to get married in front of the Bellagio lake during a show. About 2 min before the show was to begin a photog asked us to move so a couple could get married/take pics in front of the show. Ummm excuse me? We've been here like 20 min staking out our spot for the show and you're trying to steal it from me? Not cool man. Not cool.. Came here on a Saturday aftenoon and got seated pretty quickly. This was my first time here, surprising since this is a Vegas staple! 

Tony was our server and I couldn't have asked for anyone better! He told us all about the restaurant and the menu.  They give you this amazing bread at the beginning which the pizza crust is made of. Then we ordered Garlic Romano Fries as our app. For our entrée we had Italian sausage spaghetti and a large Abbondanza pizza with garlic. AMAZING!

Not to mention our drinks stayed filled the whole time. Tony was so awesome and talked history of the place and we talked hockey forever. Such a cool guy with local knowledge. I'll definitely be back for the great food and best service.. Just one visit turned me from a browser to a buyer. I could have stayed there a good while playing around with their wonderful selection of colors. Got to try one of their blushes, which I ended up getting along with a lip paint and eyelashes. Very impressed with Oscar's service with helping my friend find a red lipstick. So glad that they have a location here in the Bay Area.. What would we ever do without Putters!?!? Absolutely our favorite bar ever!! Great staff and food. Went there for dinner and the food was delicious. Chicken matsuri is soooo good and portions are very big. My boyfriend and I will be returning soon.. I have alwayd had a positive experience here. I work 5 minutes away and they are very nice and hard working staff. I will continue to come to this location.. Update--

I received a phone call last week from Rahim because he wanted to resolve the problems I've mentioned on my previous review.

They've replaced my brakes and shims to Toyota parts and it's not fluttering anymore. They detailed my car and replaced my mats. The battery acid is still embedded in my carpet, but I appreciate the attempt to fix it. 

Even though I'm still frustrated about things that I can't fix anymore and the time I wasted going back to Toyota and spending an extra $500 just to see what's wrong with my car, I really appreciate Rahim's concern. It's nice to know that he cares about the services his company provides.. I love love love these ladies  The best service I've had. I've had my lashes done for the past four years & tried a few different salons in the interim but nothing compares to Cherry Lash Lounge. I've had an amazing experience with Master Artist MaryAnn! Whenever I can't book with her I come to see Alex T. lash artist. Thank you for always making me gorgeous & keeping my beauty routine clean & simple. the greatest coolest place i discovered on my visit to phoenix! crepes or tacos with cool combinations that are italian or greek.. loved the concept and the food itself!. The food was excellent. I had the chicken adobo. The chicken was so tender.  The service was excellent.  The owners were so polite and personally introduced themselves.  They were very informative, helpful, and funny when going through the menu and answering questions about the food whilst I learned about the dishes. I will definitely go back and recommend this restaurant to anyone. PS an an inside hint about this gem of a restaurant. .. the owners/chefs have been in charge of kitchens in Beverly Hills Hilton and Phoenix, so this is five star food w/o the five star price.  Oh and the bake goods are awesome!. Great food and excellent service. I was there with a large group and we all had the buffet. The servers went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. I wouldn't hesitate to return!. Jade is a really excellent spot to come for sushi.  I had been referred here by a friend and so we came on a Friday evening.  It is a great location, just make sure you dress not super casual, we got some funny looks from not only the other diners but from the waitstaff which was uncomfortable and kind of rude.  We were just wearing (adult length) shorts and cute tops and sandals but apparently it's a little more dressy than that.  We didn't look like bums though!  Sigh.  Anyway, the sushi is presented beautifully and tastes just as lovely.  They have a great wine list, and I wish they were still on restaurant.com.  The booths are super comfy and our waiter was really helpful.  I cannot vouch for anything but the sushi but if you like sushi you should give this place a try.. I am pleasantly pleased with the delicious food here. I will be back!

Drinks weren't great. Didn't offer copper for a French mule bc they may have to put them in the dishwasher. Huh? I'm not complaining! Just confused.

BUT, once apps came I have to say the food was fabtastic. The shellfish and grits was fantastic! Like I was crazy over the grits flavor!
Fois Gras and brioche with balsamic ...damn.... this food. I'm in love.
 
Duck, mushroom ravioli I just cant....it was great!. I have always had good luck at Brio in Town Square for lunch, Happy Hour, and dinner.  Service is always good and the food and drinks are well made and full-flavored.  If you like Brio, I reccomend joining the MyBRIO REWARDS club.  You get a free meal on your birthday and various discount offers throughout the year.

This trip we came for lunch to try the new Lighter Side Menu.  About a 5 minute wait...not bad for lunch time.  Our server arrived right after we were seated for our drink order.  She was very attentive and super sweet.  I wish I remembered her name!  

I had the 5 oz Filet Brio with asparagus, cubed sweet potatoes, spinach, and roasted red peppers.  $19.95 and 365 cals.  It definitely tasted better than 365 calories...and was more filling as well!  The filet was cooked to a perfect medium rare, juicy and savory.  The portion size was just enough to share a few bites with my friend without feeling like I needed more.  For some reason I was expecting mashed sweet potatoes, but they were tiny roasted cubes and were delicious.  The asparagus, spinach, and red peppers were also prepared superbly.  All the ingredients complemented each other and the meal was delightful.  I will definitely get this again.  The price point seemed a couple dollars too high for lunch, but the meat quality was very good, so I cannot complain.

My friend had the Shrimp Mediterranean, also from the Lighter Side Menu.  $14.95/ 470 cals. It came with orzo & farro pilaf, feta, broccoli, spinach, and asparagus.  She let me sample her dish; it was very tasty and something I would order if I was not super hungry.  I think mine was more filling because of my protein choice.

All in all, another good Brio meal!. Seriously the best ice cream/gelato I have ever had. I like ice cream, frozen yogurt, gelato A LOT. I have tried a ton of places but Frost is the most amazing frozen treat I have ever had. I would give 10 stars if I could. Not to mention the staff is SUPER FRIENDLY and extremely knowledgable. You can try as many samples as you want - and I have. Oh and its low calorie!!! Wahoo! I frequent Brio next door often for date night, but never get their deserts any more - we always head to Frost.. Loved this hotel and it's casino! Any new company will have it's kinks to work out obviously, but any issues we had got resolved fast and professionally! The staff was always amazing where ever we went, the food smelled good(didn't actually eat here) and their club is amazing! The rooms are big and very nice as well. I love that there was a window to see the shower from the room;P The only downside is the location. It's about a $20 cab fare to actually get to the center strip. So if you have plans to be there the whole time, it kills your bank account. All in all this place is definitely worth visiting if you're looking for a well priced, well maintained hotel.. I started going to 51's games about two years ago. After living here for 10 years, I figured it was time to support local sports! The stadium is very cleans, staff is very friendly, concessions are lower priced than an MLB games and a good variety is offered. Various Monday home games are $1 menu nighta where you can score hot dogs, pretzels, popcorn, Cracker Jack, and peanuts for a buck each! Thursday nights are $1 Budweiser beer night, light or regular. There are also giveaway promotions throughout the season, blankets, bobbleheads etc.
Great family fun, but I won't take my son on dollar beer night again. It got a little rowdy, and the language was a bit harsh for my liking. You quickly learn the little musical clues that require a shout or clap. All in all, come out and support local events!. Ambiance is a little lacking (though the chairs with a bite taken out of them, adorable). That's easy to forgive because you can get an ice cream sandwich, made from fresh cookies and some of the best ice cream you'll ever have. For only two bucks. That right there is a starving-college-student-fat-kid's dream. I only wish they were more expensive to deter me from coming back again and again.

I don't even remember what the service was like, all I remember is deliciousness.. Bottom line - Vanessa is wonderful, and we are clients for life!    Here's our story...

Hubby and I recently made the full-time transition to Ahwatukee from our long-time home in Atlanta.  That meant a cross country trip (via TLC pet transport which is also a great company BTW) for our two older cats.  For all you cat owners out there you know cats aren't crazy about change or travel, so they were somewhat freaked out by the cross country trip.  Shortly after the cats arrived we engaged Vanessa for a very short assignment - a quick overnight getaway while we celebrated my husband's birthday.

Vanessa had arranged an in-home visit with us prior to this first assignment.  We felt comforted by the fact that she took notes, familiarized herself with our home and the kitties, etc.  She understood our concern about leaving our "babies" so soon after  the move and assured us that she would take extra good care of them.  

Everything worked well for us during the get-away,  but during that time poor Vanessa fell and broke her foot.  Despite her personal injury she was on the phone arranging for a colleague to take care of our babies.  There was no lapse in service to us, and the kitties were well cared for as promised.

So, a couple of weeks later when we had to return to Atlanta for some doctor appointments  and to drive a second car to Ahwatukee, we once again engaged Vanessa.  She explained to us that her mobility was still limited by her foot injury, but assured us that she had colleagues who, under her supervision, would provide loving care for the cats.  We felt comfortable with that.

Now the fun begins... Second night of our cross-country trip Vanessa called to tell us that the lock on the front door was broken and they couldn't get in to care for the cats.  We were on the phone for some time trying to think of options, but there was no other access.  Finally, I called a locksmith and put him in touch directly with Vanessa.  She was wonderful, arranging a time to meet the locksmith, facilitating all the details and overseeing the installation.  Problem solved and life goes on.

The next day during a visit with family in Dallas my husband fell and broke his hip.  Trip to emergency room that Sunday night, hip replacement surgery the next day, then three more days in hospital in Dallas.  Shortly thereafter we moved hubby to a rehab facility and learned that he would need at least a month of therapy before continuing our journey home to AZ.  Yikes!

I had immediately contacted Vanessa to tell her of our situation and to explain that the 10 day assignment was now going to be over a month.  Again, she assured us that we shouldn't worry that the cats would be cared for.  That has proven to be very true!

Vanessa has gone above and beyond in so many ways.  She has bundled and shipped our mail to us.  She has inventoried pet supples and advised us on getting free home delivery of additional supplies in our absence.  

One thing that was causing me immense stress was that I had shipped my desktop computer from Atlanta to Ahwatukee to coincide with our original return date.  Of course our unexpected delay meant that my computer couldn't be delivered nor returned to point of shipping because we would be at neither address.  I was going bonkers thinking about losing my computers (and e-files)!  Working with Vanessa and UPS, I was able to redirect delivery to Vanessa's house where it was safely received.  She then hauled it over to our house where it now awaits m return.

Ok, this review is turning into "War and Peace".  Hopefully you now understand why I opened this review by saying we are customers of Vanessa for life.  She is amazing and so much more than a pet sitter.. Yet another great place I would have never found without Yelp! It's not about atmosphere here. Its about wonderful food, generous portions and one of the nicest proprietors I've ever had the fortune to meet. She treated us like gold. She allowed us to sample ALL her salads and made up a special plate of them for our family to share instead of making us choose three for each entree. It was a simple thing, I suppose, but we really appreciated that she was willing to accommodate our indecisiveness. :-) I wish we lived closer. I could imagine making Beaver Choice a regular haunt. She told us that she loves Yelp! Ninety percent of her new customers come to her because of Yelp and she's won several awards for Beaver Choice, but she's most proud of her Yelp award. She'll be moving to a new, larger location soon and is looking forward to adding a bar where you can drink from large horns.. We just finished dinner at Rhythm Kitchen it was fantastic.  We had alligator appetizer cooked two ways blackened and deep fried was delicious. I had a ribeye steak cooked to perfection rare and my husband had the seafood feast which was succulent and delicious. For dessert we had beignets and chicory coffee both were fantastic. Our waiter Ivan was phenomenal he was very courteous friendly very professional. We told him that he did a wonderful job and he also looked like a young Anthony Perkins!  (That's a good thing!) We will be back thank you for the delicious meal and the great atmosphere.. Jenny brought a great concept to downtown Phoenix with this co-working space.  Not only has she created a place where people wanting a step up from a table at Starbucks can park their laptops, she's created a sense of community with all of her tenants.  So even though they all work for themselves, they work together as well.

I've been to a few social events there as well, and think it's a great, user-friendly venue.  CO+HOOTS also sponsored Get Your PHX's first Phoestivus event, which was much appreciated.  They clearly view themselves as neighborhood members, not just a business needing to pay its bills.

I was also able to find my awesome Santa Monica co-working space through Jenny, as these business owners are all very well connected.  If you're an entrepreneur and looking for a space that's more social than your dining room table yet more professional than a coffeehouse, be sure to check out CO+HOOTS!. I found myself hanging around the area in serious need of a good cup of coffee. I found Sola while walking around and loved that it wasn't overly-trendy or packed. Their lattes rock and they have a banana nut latte (always light on the syrup for me!) that warms my soul.

It's currently run by a church (wha?) but the news has leaked that his little gem is soon to be a Cartel establishment. Woo!!! They already use Cartel coffee, so it just seems like a natural progression.

There are so many cool things about Sola.

1. They are using the old Food Bar coffee cups. A little feeling of nostalgia and the greenie in me just loves it.

2. The environment is comfortable. Long community tables...long couches....books...simple = comfy. It hasn't been overly crowded when I've been there so the space worked for me.

3. They make a darn good Latte.

I've made my way back a few times since I discovered it and can't wait to hang out and make it my mobile office for the day!. Let me start off by saying that the appetizers are Amazing! We had the killer shrimp and the crispy chicken. Definitely a must try! Had the secret special chicken for my meal. It was cooked to perfection in buttery deliciousness. Sharing is definitely a good strategy when visiting. I would definitely visit again. Great service and great food.. I like the large selection of tapas.  My husband and I tried many several different plates, 1-2 from each section.  Favorites are deep dried artichoke and the foie gras.  The deep fried beignets (bunuelos) were delicious!. I have a home and a rental home in Las Vegas and BOTH homes needed to have new systems this summer. After getting estimates from the "big boys" in the business, I called a real estate broker friend of mine and asked who he used for the 20 or so homes he owns in the valley. He says that Jeremy Davis with Your Air Conditioning and Heating is who he had been using for years and he had been most satisfied!!! That was good enough for me....so I called Jeremy and he went to both properties, assessed the situations, explained all my options to me and once I decided on the system (Trane), he got back to me with very professional proposals spelling out everything including warranty, etc. He gave me a discount for multiple properties, but 
even before discount, his price was significantly lower than the 5 estimates I had done by the "big boys" in the business.  He is totally reliable, works right along beside his employees and goes beyond the call of duty to give the BEST service I have ever had!!!!  I am thrilled and I cannot believe that there is a review by Roger somebody that is so negative!!! There has to be something else going on here!!! If you need service for heating or cooling you would definitely be doing yourself a favor to give these people a call!!!. I LOVE Grimaldi's!  Since I moved to Scottsdale, I've been looking for great pizza place and I'm super picky about my pizza, haha.  But one drunk evening, my friends and I stumbled in for some pizza.  I remember thinking it was the greatest thing in the world.  I worried that it might not be as great sober, but I was wrong! It's so delicious and perfect every time! I was recently calling in a takeout order and this fabulous employee Dominic recommended the pesto pizza with tomato and the spicy chicken sausage.  OMG! I will be ordering this every time. So good! This is by far our favorite pizza! Even when my family came to visit, they loved it too!. If you are looking for a great car with great mileage and want to know the good AND the bad features, you need to talk to someone who really knows their product and who has the patience to spend the time walking you through it. Ryan Plunkett brings a professionalism and honesty to the sales industry that is unparalleled in car buying. He also provides that "after purchase" service and help that is so rare any more.  Buying a car should be a good experience not stressful or hurried. Before you look, you owe it to yourself to talk to this guy!. Great sushi and great service! Highly recommend the specialty rolls. (Warm Springs and D's Special) We eat here at least once a week!. I love this place!!!! The employees are so friendly and the food is delicious!!! I Have ate there everyday since being in Vegas!!! It is going to be so sad when I leave tomorrow and I will not have a smash burger for awhile:-(   I would highly recommend SmashBurger the hamburgers are the best and all the employees are so friendly!!!!!. Best nail salon I have ever been to! I have been to many nail salons and Herbal Nails is definitely the best salon i have been to. I got a spa pedicure for only $25 and it was the best 25 dollars I have ever spent. They used hot stones, and sea scrub on my feet and put fruit in the water. The lotion they used on my legs/ feet was very moisturizing and my legs received a 20 min massage! Everything in the salon smelt so nice and was so clean and updated. They have a large selection of colors and the colors were all OPI. I got a lot more than what I paid for and was very happy!. Just moved out here and I needed a new sushi spot, and this was so good! Clean, yummy,and quick. We had the yo sexy, no name, and couple others!! Definitely recommend it! Can't wait to go back!. Most amazing birthday/vegas trip ever.

They upgraded us because they double booked our room, had a breath-taking view from the 50th floor. Love everything about this hotel including the restaurants, shops, location, and Marquee.

I took one star off because you have to pay $20/day to use the gym which is kind of whack but who works out in Vegas anyways? (I did it just so I could say I worked out in Vegas lol)

Love the staff, room service, extremely hip and clean. Can't wait to go back :). Returned to Dapper Dan's to purchase a suit for my husband to attend a wedding.  For less than $100, we had a very nice business suit (dark blue with subtle grey pinstripes) a matching tie and minor alterations for the pant length.  Our son, who was in the wedding, had purchased a tuxedo from out of the area and the pants arrived too small.  He brought them here and they were able to trade them with another pair--at no cost.  Talk about customer service!  I'm so sorry for one group that had a less than satisfactory experience, but I would highly recommend this company to anyone.. Om nom nom....butternut squash ravioli!!! Yes please, I'll take 2! Not only is the pasta cooked to perfection but the tomato cream sauce is a perfect compliment to the sweetness of the ravioli filling. Darius (the sweet, charming, knowledgeable owner) made me feel like family during my time at La Torretta.  He even offered to pair wine with each course which made me feel like I was at a 5 star 5 diamond restaurant.  

After spending 2 months in Italy and eating as much food as one person possibly could, I know good Italian food.  When I feel a pain in my gut for Spaghetti Bolognese, I now find comfort knowing La Torretta is right down the street waiting to give me my fix!. I stayed at HRH&C last trip to Las Vegas and was extremely pleased with my Paradise Tower Pool View King room... it was modern, clean, and far enough away from the casino that I got plenty of sleep.  It was also pretty affordable compared to some of the other Vegas hotels.  Another perk is that they offer free calling from their land lines to anywhere in the US!

It was a work trip, so I don't have anything too crazy to share about my stay, but I did take advantage of the workout room, room service, and a few of the hotel coffee shops and restaurants.  I also stuck my head into their stores... very cute stuff, especially lingerie, but I didn't make any purchases.

For those that are looking for more fun, there's plenty to be had at Hard Rock.  From their Rehab pool parties, happening casino and restaurants, spa services, and even 24 hour room service of more than just food.  Yeah... as I write this, I realize I'll have to take advantage of those things next time!. Asian-Mexican fusion??? We HAD to check it out.
You pick your style, meat, rice and extras.  The actual food was pretty good, it just takes a while to get used to the ordering concept and the menu.
The restaurant itself resembles a large, cold conference building. It was pretty stark and really open. Perhaps they need all the space for lunch rush, but definitely not on a typical Friday night.. GO HERE! Biscuits and gravy are divine. The gravy was not thick and the biscuits were fluffy pillows of buttery goodness. Not tough at all! They make everything to order so it may take a few extra mins, but it is worth it. As all good things are.  Great back patio with misters, greenery, and plenty of seating. One of my new favorite spots!. I went in for banana pudding tonight and out of 4 woman customers 3 of us were pregnant! I take it as a good sign!. Not all boutiques are created equal. We decided to buy our bags in this Vegas store (and not Beverly Hills--we're from LA) simply because we enjoy buying it from Jacqueline. 

Honestly, she says it like it is and has the best sense of humor. She made us laugh the whole time. So after we purchased a necklace from her, we made sure we bought my jumbo flap from her. And when I went to pick it up, she was so cute and told me to take a picture with the box.

A girlie girl that brings out the girl in me.

We'll be buying from her for years to come.. I love #1. Super refreshing and the pandan jelly is yummy. It also has basil seeds, longan, and coconut slices. I've only been to two bambus  and I feel like the one in my area taste a little more refreshing and crisp. 

The drinks come out pretty quickly but I wished this location would be opened later since it's Vegas.. I've only been to the nail depot once, but I had a great experience.  I went on a Tuesday at 4pm and there was no wait.  They had lots of cute stylish colors and did a great job with the overall pedicure.  The place is reasonably priced, they were friendly, did a great leg/foot massage and a nice paint job.  They also had music playing which I prefer over TVs.. I stayed at the New York New York hotel for my last impromptu night in Vegas.. We came back from a long walk and excitement from Treasure Island hotel and were famished!  We looked around 10pm and not many of the small places to eat were open at our Hotel... Luckily, Il Fornaio was still open and my friend was craving for italian anyways!  I actually ate at Il Fornaio in Downtown San Jose already so it was a chance for me to compare and know that the food no matter what would be good!

Service may i say was EXCELLENT! a bit TOO EXCELLENT maybe.. is that possible? from the beginning to our meal to the end of our to go boxes, the service was impeccable.. I don't think i ever seen someone tie my to go box plastic bag that neatly and tidey before!!  Our waiter was very friendly and he made our experience here fantastically genuine!  We sat in the outdoor section near the corner for less of a noise.  It was very intimate and awesome to see the people around the hotel interact... *people watch*  ( don't tell me you guys don't do that!) Plenty of bread was provided with dipping sauce ( or butter if you ask) 

We ordered:

1.  Conchiglie al Pollo $18 which consisted of shell pasta, chicken breast, broccoli, sun-dried tomatoes, roasted garlic, trebbiano wine, pecorino cheese 

2. Turtei con Aragosta $24 which consisted of Fresh ravioli filled with fresh Maine lobster topped with shrimp, diced tomato and lobster-cream sauce 

I actually prefered the shell pasta dish.. it was very tasty.. I think i found out that raviolis aren't my pasta of choice..i will stick to my penne next time :). This location offers a great customer service team, from management down.

I have never had to wait more than 5 minutes for help and then once I am being serviced, it is always speedy and fast. 

The employees do not mind having a friendly, casual conversation either. I never feel displaced or bothersome. 

My only gripe is the location of the drive through ATM. Sometimes it is too hard for me to see the screen depending on the location of the sun. Maybe I just need to be taller or need a bigger car so I sit higher up. LOL. 

(I originally had this review under the wrong ONCU location. OOPS! ). Hey folks, this is the Bellagio Cafe in Las Vegas not Denny's in Podunkville, so it's going to be on the expensive side, but you do get what you pay for and what you don't!  What you don't get . . . ketchup in dirty refilled bottles, sticky maple syrup bottles, paper napkins, and the list goes on and on!

What you do get is great atmosphere, delicious food and courteous service. Even while standing line (and there often is a long line), you get to enjoy the stunning seasonal display and fragrant smells of the Bellagio Conservatory. Our favorite spot to sit is in the clover-shaped 4-plex booth to the left when you walk up the ramp, facing the conservatory . . . what a view and you get some of the best people watching in Vegas!

The food is consistently delicious.  Over the years (most recently in early March 2012), we have tried just about everything on the breakfast and lunch menus. For breakfast, I highly recommend the Bellagio Classic Omelet or the Maryland Crab Cake Benedict.  I always ask for my eggs on the soft side and they have never failed me. I also like my hash browns well, almost burnt, and they for the most part, that's what I get. For lunch, try the Cobb. My husband swears by it!

Coffee is top notch, and they will leave a carafe on your table. They have real cream or milk, not the faux stuff that comes in mini plastic cups. I adore the fact that when you order an iced tea, the ice cubes are actually made with the tea itself as well. 

We used to love to linger in the cafe when they had Keno, but they have removed the game it seems from all MGM Mirage properties across the board. So sad! We really missed it on this trip!. We shopped for engagement rings from both two national stores (that advertise like crazy) and two local jewelers. Ultimately we wanted to support local business. This jeweler gave me an amazing ring at an incredible price. He also included the appraisal (can you believe some stores don't?). 

They have been in business since 1946 and I bought a ring from them 25 years ago that was beautiful, but this ring is simply stunning. They are more wholesalers than they are retailers, which may explain the customer service dings they've gotten from two reviews. However, they treated me and my fiancé very well.

I highly recommend them.. I love shopping at Whole Foods - the overall experience is great.  Anytime I've bought produce, I've found odd fruits/vegetables in their display that I've taken home and really enjoyed. (last time was the Buddha's Hand).  I've eaten at almost all their eating places (the Smoke House - GREAT burgers and fries, the Beer/Wine has great selection, the salad bar always has a variety of salad toppings - organic, too! - and their hot food bar is always pretty inventive with a few great typicals).  I've always noticed their staff is friendly and caring and I've never had a 'bad' staff experience.  I love how they always offer you complimentary ice (this is super helpful esp during the summer) for your grocery bags.  Returning things here has always been easy (even produce - my Cuties were a bit rancid). Their Whole Body area has tons of options that I'm still going through.  Finally, their Cafe/Juice bar, which I just tried most recently was super impressive - I've been juicing a ton lately and for less than 7 dollars, I got a big juice chock full of all their greens, ginger, beets, carrots - literally a lunch in itself.  I will be going back for juices during those times I am running late and just need a juice to hold me... pricey, but well worth it when it has so many nutrients.. Love, love, love this place. Waffles and boba tea are two of my favorite things, such a treat to have them together. My usual is the plain waffle with strawberries and walnuts and milk tea with lychee flavor and boba. Best waffles around!. Excellent, authentic Thai and super convenient location near Sherbrooke station! This place is small (just a few tables, best for groups under 4 people) although I suppose in the summer the patio increases their capacity. The vibe is intimate and cozy. Food may take a while to arrive, but it's worth it. Presentation is excellent (fried rice served in a pineapple, tom yum soup served in a coconut!) and the dishes are flavourful, with a really good amount of spice. I really loved the spicy chicken salad with lettuce leaves. The menu is small with some interesting dishes, not just your usual standard Thai dishes that you see everywhere. Be sure to see what the daily specials are. Service when I went was excellent and thoughtful - definitely no attitude from the server regarding my subpar French! I would certainly come back here next time I am in Montreal.. WOW.  LOVE!

They are everything it's hyped up to be and then some.  It's not easy getting there but it was well worth the effort.  Luckily, we got there late afternoon and there was not a line.  

When you order your sandwich, they'll ask if you want fat or lean.  Go with the fat, my friends and thank me later.  You'll be a fool to have the lean option.  

We grabbed a seat at a table and our sandwiches came shortly.  The sandwich is regular size but the mountain of meat was overwhelming!   The meat was so tender and flavorful.  Honestly, I knew there was no way I can even finish half and I can eat!  Our waiter, George, an old timer there came over and threatened (teased) me that I will not be allowed to leave if I don't finish my sandwich.  He's so nice, just like a grandpa and just couldn't resist taking a pic with him - not to mention he has a great name!

The price is so affordable.  If we must choose between Schwartz's or Kat's, it will be Schwartz's.. My husband and I decided to have a late breakfast.  I ordered a typical breakfast; pancakes, eggs, and bacon. My husband ordered a bacon, tomato, avocado, green onion omelette with breakfast potatoes. We also ordered something called a pot of bread. The pot of bread was homemade bread that was baked in a muffin ten. You could tell that this bread was  homemade and freshly made. It was very good. The service was excellent and we would definitely come back to Jamm's restaurant.. Delicious pizza  ! The oven makes the crust bubbly and crispy. Was very happy to find out Tuesday is half price large pizzas.  Service is always good. I have dined at Culinary Dropout twice, both before concerts. Even though I made a reservation each time (7pm on a Tuesday, 8pm on a Friday), it didn't seem necessary. My guest and I were seated without a wait. The ambience is cool, yet comfortable. It is difficult to identify servers since they do not have a uniform, but they are very attentive. 

On to the food...like all of the previous posters, you will do yourself a disservice if you don't have the soft pretzels with provolone fondue. If you don't use all of the cheese, save it for your meal. My husband dipped his fries in it and also spread it on his perfectly grilled burger. I had the chicken club sandwich. The chicken breast was grilled, tender, and flavorful. With the turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and honey mustard, it was a perfect combination of flavors and textures. 

I highly recommend saving room for dessert. This was my favorite part of the meals. The monkey bread is baked when you order it, served warm a la mode. Very delicious. However, I think my new favorite is the caramel custard. The very generous portion of the salted caramel custard has a consistency similar to creme brûlée. It is topped with a thick layer of caramel syrup and their own delicious caramel corn. It is decadent and rich, more than enough to share with one or two people. 

This restaurant may be a good replacement for a fun meal since Johnny Smalls closed.. Chris and his team are awesome.  My girls and I had an amazing time in Vegas this past weekend.  Free entry and line skip at Marquee on Friday and free entry and free drink at Haze on Saturday... where Lloyd was performing!!! :D

I always have an amazing time when I go to Vegas, and it's all due to Free Vegas Club Passes.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!. This place is awesome! It's a little sandwich shop right on the corner. I love the ambiance and the food is fresh and amazing. Can't beat the price either!. Been coming here for years and seen them grow. Best coffee in all of Phoenix and great bar. Couldn't give it a 5 because of spotty wifi and overcrowded that there's been multiple times I've had to leave because I couldn't find parking or no seating inside.. Went for hubby's birthday dinner tonight.  
Say what you will about "chain" restaurants, but this place rocks.  
We're sitting there, chatting away, and the manager comes to our table, apologizes for the appetizer taking so long, and comps the app.  Holy cow!  We didn't even notice!  We've waited longer for drinks.
We had the Wild West Shrimp for our app.  Excellent.
Hubby had the Outlaw Ribeye for his entree. He was very pleased.  
I had the Flat Iron steak with the stuffed bella shroom.  Very very good.  Will order again.
Too full for dessert, unfortunately.
Manager stopped by out table THREE times during the meal to ask how everything was.  Unbelievable customer service.  Highly recommend this place.. Leigh is the bomb! She really listens to you and is so good at what she does. I love the way my hair turned out and already have my next appointment booked.. For an AYCE situation, they offer some pretty High End offerings.  The salmon and tuna sashimi was my first form of attack.  Then a few specialty rolls, which were delish and constantly replenished, but I can't seem to remember at this time.  A cup of coffee and a tiny bite of my cheesecake and I off to accomplish more shopping, which makes this location so convenient.. I just love this little neighborhood gem!

I've purchased cupcakes, cookies, cakes, and even a pie from Treehouse Bakery. Mostly recently it was a birthday cake for my Grams' 95th - she and my family were just thrilled because it was so cute, so personalized, and so yummy!

They do a great job at reasonable prices. Plus, it's good to support a local business. I'm already looking forward to my next visit.. These are the most incredibly delicious and moist cakes I have ever had!  I discovered them on vacation in Arizona and wish we had one where I live.   The store is so cute (filled with great gift items) and the cakes are soooo yummy!.  I send everyone I know, have carried them back to Chicago with me and have shipped them all over the country.    My friends beg me to bring them home when I visit Scottsdale.  If you haven't tried one  you cannot imagine what good cake tastes like!!. I went to Dr. Aspacio last week for my ongoing acne issue and he was very helpful.  After reading some bad reviews I was very nervous that he would disappoint but I was very satisfied with the service I received.  The office was very nice and clean, and only 5 minutes from my apartment.  I got an appointment 4 days after I called which was shocking because back in Ohio it usually takes about a month to get an appointment to see a derm.  After he wrote me a couple prescriptions, a nurse came into the room and gave me some great advice on some different products I could use, such as the Clarisonic face brush.  I'm so glad I decided to go to him rather than listen to some of these bad reviews.  I will definitely recommend Dr.Aspacio to anyone looking for a dermatologist and I plan on making another appointment very soon!. Amber and Kelsey, are the 2 best waitresses at the restaurant!  My family has been coming here since we moved to AZ 8 yrs ago.   Soo tried and true. You will not be disappointed.   We have gone thru the entire menu over 4 times!!   Love, love , love!!!. I love this place and so does my hubby summer or winter we are there at least twice a month. The staff is pretty friendly, we met the owner once he seemed busy but other than that ok.. Jimmy is THE best!  You may find a cigar a dollar cheaper but it doesn't come with the customer service Jimmy gives....sit down and chat while enjoying a smoke or hang out watching your favourite sports game on TV.. Attractive, fun, and super helpful staff! Tried so many places and flavors...never was content until I discovered Puff Vapors!!! Highly recommend them.  Thanks guys!!!. I tried the bay chick skillet.  Absolutely delicious!!! My friends had the s'mores pancakes and banana cream pi pancakes.  Everything was delicious and price was great.  Nothing expensive.  So when you lose money in the casinos, you can still eat.. Came here for the first time not that long ago, but heard from friends that the menu changed recently. We are a fan! We go to sushi muramoto a lot and like it there but when youre feeling like having an izakaya style meal, this place is great. I have not tried any of the rolls but we just randomly ordered some ikura and salmon nigiris and a tekka hand roll. Both raw and cooked scallop dishes are good, beef tongue is good, sashimi plate, snapper head are very good. Octopus salad was okay, yakiudon was extremely saucy. Skewers are okay. Veggie tempura udon looked good  (great/small portion). And to finish, the sesame ice-cream was noms! 

Almost all plates come in 3s (we went with 4 people and had fun figuring out how to split) and food is beautifully plated.. We checked this out for the first time last weekend, and I am really disappointed that it took me this long to ever come here!  (I must admit - I'm a former South Oakland resident, and will thus be Dirty Souf 4 Lyfe, so crossing that magical border of Bellefield Avenue into North Oakland is kind of a stretch for me!)

On a Saturday night, it was pratically empty, so we had very attentive waiter service.  They were great with refills and prompt delivery of our food (and also patience with the fact that we food blogger types have to take pictures of everything before we eat it).

They do have a wine list, and while it's small, it's also relatively cheap.  The bottles were all less than $30 each, and we got a nice shiraz to go with our dinner.

We started with the samosas, which were quite good, but standard, and then, in a flash of greatness, the words 'vegetable chat' caught my eye on the menu.

Vegetable chat is this thing that I love, that I've never known the name of.  It's a cold almost-salsa-like dish made up of chickpeas, potatoes, onions, and Indian seasonings, then topped with crunchy crackers (the same consistency and flavor of the samosa shell), yogurt, and tamarind sauce.  It's like a less-mayonnaise-d version of potato salad.  Oh, how I love it!  Star of India's was absolutely perfect, and I'm so glad I took a chance on ordering it.

However, not wanting to step totally out of my comfort zone, I ordered my typical mattar paneer.  It was good, and not a huge portion, so I didn't feel compelled to just keep eating and eating the deliciousness in front of me.

My husband got the tandoor mixed grill, which had chicken, shrimp, and lamb.  He was crazy about it.  Like most Indian restaurants, you can pick the level of spice for each entree.  The garlic naan was ridiculously puffy and buttery, which we loved.

We will definitely return to Star of India.  It's much more low-key than India Garden, but the food is just as good.  If you want a nice, laid-back place to have a bottle of wine and some tasty Indian food, check this restaurant out.  The only thing you'll have to worry about is parking, as it's metered street parking only, and this stretch of Craig Street can be busy, especially on the weekends.. Please be sure to save your appetite before dinning here! They have it all.......I have never seen so many different cuisines being offered...... You can expect to try Italian, japanese, Mexican, American, foods from around the world. This 25,000 square foot buffet will astound you! Save room for dessert! They are hot and fresh out of the oven, scrumptious, lavish desserts. Wow!. Oh, we love Pamela's in the Strip. We come here several weekends a month for a Sunday brunch. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait in the early morning, but it's well-worth it. Or you can go a little later in the afternoon and get seated right away. 

This place is so cute. Every time we're there, we find some new picture or kitschy item to smile about. And it is so consistent. You know you're going to get exactly what you order, exactly how you expect it, and every time we come for breakfast, it never changes. 

The veggie and mushroom and cheese omelet are fantastic, huge and well-stuffed. Gail's Favorite Eggs are another great choice - who would have thought a dollop of cream cheese on scrambled eggs would be so amazing!? The lyonnaise potatoes are the superstar on the plate though. And I love that they serve your coffee in a huge carafe so you never have to wait for a refill! 

The staff are always super friendly and welcoming, although they do get busy and it can be a wait on drink refills. 

I can't say enough about how much I love this location! 

Pamela's is cash-only. There is a PNC ATM right around the corner and a Citizen's Bank ATM a few blocks up Penn Ave.. OMG!!!  This place is the best!!!  I love hot dogs, but usually I will only eat them with the most general toppings... ketchup, mustard, relish... but this place just BLEW MY MIND!  For $3 you get a hot dog wrapped in bacon in a bun with beans, tomatoes, cheese, mayo, guac, onions, ketchup, and mustard.  I decided to go for the almost all but the mayo and onions and it was so effin delicious!!! 

PROS:  The hot dog bun is TO DIE FOR!!!  The crispy bacon wrapped around the hot dog is perfection... the whole gosh darn thing is too delicious to put into words.  Go get one!!! 

CONS:  Cash only, it's in a car wash parking lot.... There was a time when I judged Chop Shop. If you went to Chop Shop when it first opened you might have noticed that it didn't have the best sound quality. Friends, that has changed. They fixed whatever was wrong. 

This might be my favorite venue in Charlotte. That is a strange thing to say considering the awkward paintings of half naked women and sometimes the ridiculously long line to get inside (it always seems to take forever to pay and show ID there)

However, the sound is excellent. There are 2 stages. It is small. It is intimate. It isn't trying to be more than what it is.  The drinks are good. There is a small outdoor area.

This is how I like to see shows.

Oh- and Wolf Blitzer and Anderson Cooper gave a shout out to Chop Shop on CNN. We are making it big time, kids.. Absolutely delicious!! Waffles are amazing. It's tiny but it doesn't matter its a real treat. A great selection if you're in the mood to invest time looking and willing to pay a little more.. We enjoyed a nice Thursday night at Cove Trattoria. Pasta, salads and canolis. Good amount of choices from rich and savory, to light and healthy. Thanks Deborah, you were great.. Fantastic car wash, friendly cashiers/employees and great prices!

We stayed at the Red Rock and didn't have time to wash the car before our trip. We got their $19 car wash, which included the interior and exterior. Everyone was very friendly, even in the heat! Plus, unlike the car washes back home, they actually cleaned the interior pretty thoroughly. We accidentally left some magazines, a sun shade, etc in the backseat. Rather than cleaning around the stuff, they stacked everything up neatly and so they could vacuum the floor. 

They have a nice lobby with air conditioning while you wait. Their prices on food and drinks were pretty on par with other convenience stores. They even have gas and a small repair shop!. We had my daughter's wedding reception dinner here. It was perfect! The chef, Nigel was very accomodating and the appetizers and meals brought raves from our guests.
The staff was exteremely helpful with arranging the room to meet our needs. Great place for a special event. We have also enjoyed the buffet when my family stopped by for lunch.. Very quick easy to make appt!! I got a groupon and decided to try it out I like it and. She finished my nails in 30 min. American Junkie is a great addiition to Scottsdale its laid back but hip at the same time. I can't really say much about this place except for watch out for the line it gets crazy and they have bottle service here which I think is a joke I would compare it to Maloney's having bottle service......ridiculous!. We are currently doing baby splash (free for babies under 6 months) and love it. The teachers are generally enthusiastic and always friendly. Although each week we usually do the same things, it's fun and helpful getting baby comfortable in the water. I went to see Iliza Shlesinger a few weeks ago with my husband, sister, and her fiance. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, especially having read the polarized reviews here, but we ended up having a great time.

I liked the location, which is easy to get to, and close to Yogurtini (great for a snack before or after the show). We arrived early, wandered around a bit, discovered Yogurtini, and made our way up the steps just a few minutes before six; I think we were the fourth or fifth group in line. We ended up with a great table close to the stage. Yes, the tables are shoved up against one another, but it's fine; we had no difficulty walking amongst the tables and it was easy to ignore or talk to others if we wanted.

We shared appetizers, and it was plenty of food even without an entree; I do think the prices were a bit stiff, but considering the amount of time you spend in the seats, they were fine.

It was easy to hear the comedians (two openers and the main act), but not so easy to hear the rest of my party before the show. It's one big open room, terrible for acoustics. Not to mention they practically blew my eardrums out with their opening video, highlighting some upcoming shows and the rules. I don't know why they had to play it so loud.

All in all, besides the sound level, it was a very enjoyable night.. My brother introduced me to this place...very good food.  Southern Italian from what I understand.  I ordered the Linguine with Clams...very good!  My bro loves the Pasta ala Nora and the Orange Roughy dish.  My dad ordered the Chicken Marsala and he enjoyed it.  We also ordered the Antipasto salad which was yummy, with lots of fresh meat on it.   The service was very good...they were very attentive. From what I understand they used to be smaller and then when they were featured on some show and got more popular they had to add on an extra room to accomodate all their new customers.   I seriously felt like there was a little old Italian lady that cooked our meals for us...so yummy:)  Make sure to make reservations...we went on a Tuesday, made reservations, and we still had to wait a bit!  Oh, and it's located in a shopping center, behind an Arby's!. Delicious Steak.... enough said:)   well it's pricey but oh so worth it.. Whenever I get a chance to eat Jollibee, I always opt for the spaghetti with 1 piece chicken and it never lets me down. This location is a mini Filipino town that has a supermarket, fast food, and bakery all in one. Inside the plaza includes Jollibee restaurant. The cashiers are very friendly and are fast workers. The spaghetti had lots of cheese and hot dog, while the chicken was crispy and not so greasy. I love that they provide a side of gravy to drop my chicken. The location is spacious and very clean. I would totally come back when I visit Vegas.. Just went here and loved it.   Great food, good prices, good service and they sell loose leaf tea to take home.   Awesome, highly recommended.. Traditional diner with red vinyl booths and diner coffee. Very homey and quaint, and you can't beat the price. I enjoyed the omelette with kale and black eyes peas, and the home fries were perfectly crispy on top. I will definitely be back for lunch or dinner

There is plenty of parking on Baum, and the place was crawling with customers on Sunday morning for breakfast.. Nice and rare to find a pizza place that's all organic, not to mention the gluten free options! Split the shrimp and pepper pizza and the honey smoked salmon with a friend, they were both really good and we took quite a bit home. Save room for the apple cobbler, it is melt in your mouth and totally worth it.. Chairs old and need to be replaced (reason for the four star) BUT the staff is superrrr friendly and makes it worth coming :) this was my first time and I got the blended famous mint mocha. Delicious and perfect for the warm weather! Definitely a new customer!. Came here for lunch after a field trip with my students. Great service, great staff, great food!. Pretty awesome place.  Although it's true that the burgers are too small, they really are de-lish ! Seasoned perfectly and on a soft but not mushy bun...these burgers hit the spot. I see some people complaining about the price but maybe they were ordering the double burger.  I don't get the whole infatuation with the cheese fries tho which were around $4.  To me, the plain fries are pretty much perfect by themselves and a good sized portion.     Very friendly staff & a clean, roomy restaurant and a little more upscale than a typical fast food place.  The music is a little loud but maybe  the young people dig that.  Definitely recommend !. They're awesome at what they do here.  BBQ pork, roasted duck, noodles.  Crowded, and long waits sometimes.  Also, sometimes on a busy day/night, they run out, so call ahead.. Popped into de la Cruz after opening night of Othello at the Mesa Arts Center. It was after 10:30 and their kitchen had already closed but our server and the manager could tell that we were famished. They offered to put together a few of the appetizers or a cut of prime rib, which they now feature on Friday nights.

We ended up getting their signature De La Cruz shrimp cocktail - yummmm - and the prime rib. Because their regular cut is so thick, my foodie friend and I asked to split it and we were grateful when we saw the size of the half portion (still 8-10 ounces). I was happily surprised by the quality, tenderness and flavor of the meat.

The manager was telling us that, in addition to the prime rib, they plan to keep the menu simple and feature a lot of different specials. They usually have some interesting wines, too, and we managed to suck down two bottles of the Twenty Bench Cabernet. That's a wine that I will have to look for at AJ's next time I'm there. 

They now have live music on the weekends. The band was a bit loud but didn't seem to mind turning down the volume when asked. 

That area of Mesa has sooooo much potential to be a great dining, retail and culture center. De La Cruz is pretty much the flag ship restaurant right now but I hope they succeed because it will be a huge windfall for the community.. Delicious, fresh ingredients you can taste ! Very flavorful and large portions. Its my new favorite Philly shop , the customer service, food, and atmosphere is all top notch !. Sushi at a burger joint?? Absolutely. Not just for burgers anymore...besides having amazing burgers and salads, Delux has sushi!! Grade A sushi for that matter. Not many places have THAT on their menu. I'm a sushi snob and Delux sushi is outstanding. What does Delux's owner know about sushi? He used to own Zen 32. Check it out. You wont be disappointed.. I like Filipino food. This place has a great selection of meals, snacks, and desserts. Yummy stuff.. The five stars is for just being a Frank Lloyd Wright inspired building- it echoes the same principles of harmonizing with the environment and echoing those elements into the interior- and harnessing natural light to its full efficacy...I was here during a conference- but wished I could have stayed and taken advantage of the resort- golf, spa, dining and pool...wonderful place!. Saw a yelp deal, so decided to give it a try while visiting a friend. SO good! We tried six different flavors, my favorite was the salted caramel, with second being the pineapple and triple berry mixed together. Great customer service, very friendly place. Just wish I lived closer!. I've been a fan of AZ Tips & Toes Scottsdale location for a while but was so excited to find this other location!! It's a lot less busy and all of the nail technicians are extremely nice. I'm always impressed with the quality of their work and never leave this salon disappointed! I've been a loyal customer for all 4 years of my college experience :)!. My husband and I needed a new car and he made an appointment with a dealer at the dealership. However, that particular dealer had to leave, but set us up with his sales manager. When we got there, the sales manager left us in the capable hands of Jayson. Jayson is very funny and outgoing and made the search for the car an enjoyable experience. For the negotiations, Jayson was aided by Donte and after a lengthy back and forth, we finally agreed on a deal that was beneficial for both sides. This was the first experience my husband and I had in getting a car on our own, and thankfully, it wasn't an exact replica of the nightmare that I've always had about buying a car. My husband and I are thinking that if (knock on wood) our other car breaks down, then we will come back here for a second car.. This was my favorite place to stop by for a relaxed night of good conversation, food, and a drink. My favorite beer here is the Oude Zuippers (spelled something like that). I actually think this place has great food too (a lot of people seem to say that they have good beer but not good food, but I disagree!). I LOVE their Caprese Crisp, the citrus salad,and the pizzas.. This is an absolute must for brunch! We are from San Francisco and found this place online. It did not disappoint! Live music, bottomless mimosa and AMAZING food! We had the jalapeño cakes and chimichirri hash. The staff is super attentive and friendly. If we lived here we would make this a regular spot!. I live a 30 minute drive away, but I would gladly make the journey any day of the week!  Walking inside this Krispy Kreme was like taking a step back in time!  You actually get to watch the donuts being made through a glass partition!  So cool!  Then you come around the corner and see the menu and the seating.  It's just like a mid-20th century diner!  There are paper hats stacked everywhere, free for the taking.  I wore mine home proudly!  The kids seemed to love them too.  On the menu, I first noticed that coffee is only 25 cents!  WHOA!  The donuts cost about the same as competing donut chains, but they're so good, there's no contest!  When I ordered my dozen, I made sure to try an abundant variety.  I also made sure half were glazed.  Mmm!  The glazed ones... well, my God!  The cashier actually turned around and plucked them right off the conveyer belt of fresh donuts!  Coming here was such a nice experience!  I would definitely recommend it, especially coming inside to check it out.  And make sure you grab a hat on your way out the door.  :). Fantastic and fast service. The staff are very friendly at this location. Now that wet live back in this area, this will be out main location. My favorite part at this location during this visit was the fresh cucumbers on the salsa bar. My boys live the carne asada burritos and the bacon and egg breakfast burrito. Personally, I am a #4 all the way, no matter the location, 2 shredded beef tacos with rice and beans...YUMMY!. The owner, Jeff, was extremely professional and friendly.  He responded to our emergency call for service at 10:30 PM on a Wednesday evening without requiring us to pay a nighttime upcharge.  He did a great job rekeying our entire house at an extremely reasonable price.  We highly recommend Sparks' Locksmith!!!. Best Sandwiches- actually, in general best vegan dinner spot in town. I never have to worry if there's meat or dairy in my food :) and raw food nights are amazing!. Great place to get a mimosa or bacon bloody merry :-)
I'm a regular at this place because of good food and great breakfast.....the staff is always friendly....but...unfortunately the customers are always rude. I've witnessed table hawks and pushiness on numerous occasion.....I've sat at the bar and had people hover over my food and try to force feed me just to get my stool.....I guess that's because this is a popular neighborhood place.. I've got one word for you: Yum!  A recent dinner here was a major hit.  I had the sashimi plate (12 pieces for $20...not bad at all) and a dragon roll, and it was delicious.  I can be a bit picky about my sashimi, but this was beautifully and generously cut, with several pieces of amazing tuna and salmon alongside the ubiquitous octopus.  I somehow missed a piece that was disguised as a garnish, but our waiter pointed it out when he cleared my plate so I could snap it up.  My roll was a perfect size too, not too small but not so obnoxiously large that I couldn't eat it in one bite.

My sister eats gluten-free, which was easily accommodated -- they brought her a different bottle of soy sauce, and our server went so far as to mention to her not to try my roll, since it had gluten in it.  Our request for how to split up the rolls between several plates was also handled correctly.

A few minor, minor items: I don't quite understand why my sashimi plate came with a bowl of (warm) rice.  Never seen that before, and if I'd wanted rice, I would have ordered chirashi.  It was easy to set to the side and ignore though, so no big deal.  Also, soda is canned (no fountain, I guess), but they brought me a glass of ice and even poured for me.  As others have mentioned, the restaurant is not large, but at 7:30 on a Saturday we didn't have a problem getting seated.

All in all, I'm a fan.  I'll definitely come back here for sushi!. The most charming, beautiful and amazing restaurant I've ever been to. The food was superb! I wish they would open one in Vegas!. I liked it but hubby thinks it's overpriced.  Food was very good, I had a veggie  omelette, nice and hot and chock full of veggies.  Service was excellent.  Nice little spot for breakfast.  Pancakes were light and fluffy, so they're true to the name.  If I can talk him into going back with me, we'll go again, some of those fancy pancake dishes look like they are worth trying out.. I've been going to this place for the past few months and I absolutely love it! They do very good work and they are very clean. They are always so friendly and nice as well. If you are in the SW area of Vegas and need your nails done I highly recommend sweet nails. I walked in to enter the place and stood there...seriously had no idea how to enter...it was kinda gnarly.... You'll see what I'm talking about when you go ....My craft bartender Davey was amazing!  He presented the summer menu to me and I just told him surprise me...and every time he created a new cocktail it was better than the last....This is s must stop for Downtown Las Vegas visitors and locals.... Ask for Davey I'm sure you'll have a happy ending to your night!!. It was mine and my bf's first time at that buffet. We didn't want to eat there at 1st because it was a bit pricey for our budget. They let us look inside   before we decided to eat there. They have a lot of good options; soups, salads, seafood, meat, sushi, dumplings, egg rolls, pickled veggies, Mexican food, about 5 flavors of ice cream, a bunch of desserts, fruit &  some other things, theres too much to mention. You can order alcohol for extra cost but soft drinks, juice, ice tea and coffee are included.

We were full and happy.
I would love to go there again when ever we're in Vegas.  

I suggest you ask to look inside before you pay so you know if thats what you want to eat.. This is some seriously good pizza. I had it a couple week ago at food truck friday and it was just delicious. Like going to a fancy shmancy pizza place, but only like 8$....can't beat that! I got the popeye (?), the one with spinach, garlic, tomato, basil, and deliciousness. It was just wonderful...I will definitely be back here...yum!. We have been coming Rumbi for years.  It's what I call "slow fast food".  You go up to the counter and order your food.   They then give you a number to place on your table and they will bring it to you in 5-10 minutes.

The rice bowls have a ton of food and I always have enough for lunch the next day.  I've also had their chicken sandwich....delicious!   They also have sweet potato fries which is always a plus in my book!   Their tropical salsa is homemade and fantastic!

I would definitely recommend this place for lunch or dinner.  Mondays and Tuesdays are kids eat free.   A meal will run you around $10 and is well worth it!. Delightful margaritas, super yummy roasted corn, and helpful staff. Chips and salsa are perhaps the best I have ever had. Will stop back next time I'm in town.. Fresh and excellent food.   Service was great too.   I don't think there was msg in food which is a huge plus.   I would recommend.. Nail Affair is the best nail salon I have ever been to. The staff is incredibly friendly and hospitable. I always feel welcome when I come in to get my nails done. Kevin is amazing and is also the owner of the nail salon. I enjoy this place so much that I also take my daughter with me so she can get her nails done too. I always get compliments on my nails. I highly recommend this nail salon.
Kerri Zimmerman. Ohmygod. THIS PLACE! Thiiiiiiisssssspllllaaaaaaaccceeeeeee! 

SO GOOD.

As I was visiting from out of town, I decided to call in my order and proceeded to greedily eat all of my food by myself in my hotel room, in a manner that I would have been embarrassed to do in public. I was not mistaken to do so. I wanted to SHOVEL it into my face it was so delicious. I'm pretty sure I was using both hands to eat at one point. 

First things first: the woman who took my order? Very nice. Patient with me as I tried to navigate their 1-million-item menu. I asked her for a couple of recommendations; I like sweet and sour, chicken, maybe a veggie or two and not too spicy; she obliged with several tasty suggestions. I got the sweet and sour noodles, orange chicken, shanghai egg rolls and some awesome garlicky bok choi number; everything was on target. (Not the fried donuts though...those were kind of lame.)

Go here. Order. Eat with both hands. 
You will be ever so glad that you did.. Le concept estr simple: tout à 5$. Les plats sont simples mais valent le détour. Évidemment, à ce prix, les portions ne sont pas énormes, alors je recommande de commander une salade et un dessert (ça revient à 15$, toujours abordable). Ça se complique lorsqu'on décide de commander de l'alcool, la facture monte rapidement. Autre que cela, le service est génial, assez rapide mais pas trop et nous laisse le temps de profiter de la déco un peu rétro mais surtout très originale! Essayez la terrasse pour bien profiter de l'atmosphère de St-Denis.. Les employes sympathiques, une bonne boulangerie et fromagerie. 

J'y vais pour les sandwiches sont bons, pas chers, pour la pizza pâte fine, les fromages et les variétés de pains spéciaux selon le jour où on y va. I can not explain how much I love this place!  The food is authentic, high quality, and very reasonably priced.  We always get Afandi's when we have a party - we even had them cater our wedding party and everything came out beautifully.

I also make a point to buy my chicken from their butcher counter, as I trust that it is fresh and from a good source (unlike regular grocery stores).. After five years, my favorite Michael Kors watch died. A friend highly recommend Battery Giant to me, so I stopped in to give them a try. They went above and beyond for me! They were very knowledgeable and informed on the batteries they carried. They even changed the battery for me at the store!. Awesome dentist and remarkable team!. I'm so glad I ignored the bad reviews, anytime auroras was so pleasant to work with I called them because of a promotional of 50$ our four Harkins tickets with a windshield replacement. They were not only very kind and pleasant on the phone but they came out the next morning to my home. It didn't cost me anything out of pocket die to insurance coverage and they gave me a 50$ rebate. Tyson came to replace my windshield he was on and out in 20 minutes and was so nice and professional. Highly recommend.. Nice, clean hotel.  I had a room by the elevator on a Friday night and was concerned about noise.  I didn't hear a thing.  Good location for shopping at Greenway and many restaurants nearby.  I did not use the pool but it looked nice with a play area for kids.  I would stay here again.  Free internet.  Keurig, microwave, and refrigerator in room.  Very comfortable.. I kept seeing this place on yelp and we finally got to go. My fiance and I had a terrible experience last night at a sushi restaurant so this was nice. 

It's small there's only about 5 tables but it's not uncomfortable or clustered. The music is just loud enough to not be intrusive but makes it nice. The service was prompt,  the sandwich was amazing,  the place was clean,  and they offered us a small free brownie. Why? Just because! 

Great place for lunch. Will def be coming back.. Emily's is actually in the complex I work at so it's very handy. The food is always so good and fresh. If you need anything special they can most likely make it for you. I've had many different items on the menu from the Salmon BLT, Grilled Cheese to the Ahi Tuna salad. You cannot go wrong with anything here!!!. A recurring theme of my childhood was "DON'T TOUCH THAT!"  "PUT THAT DOWN RIGHT NOW" and "SO HELP ME, I WILL RIP OFF YOUR LITTLE ARMS AND LEGS".  Ok, that last one might not be totally related, but clearly, I'm scarred.  For some reason as soon as you tell me not to touch something, I'm all "TOUCHY TOUCHY TOUCHY!"  and that does not work in most museums!  They get really pissy if you reach for the Mona Lisa.  

So the Arizona Science Center is PERFECT for those who share my tactile proclivities.  YOU CAN TOUCH EVERYTHING! For those who are germ phobic, plenty of hand sanitizing stations to keep you clean.

We spent about 4 hours, you could go longer with older children, but if you have toddlers that might be your max.  You can leave and come back with the wristband, in spring or fall it would be perfect to go in the AM, have a picnic, and then come back for additional visits.

The Planetarium and the IMAX, as well special exhibits like the Star Trek the Exhibition.  We paid extra for the IMAX and Star Trek, but decided we didn't have time for the Planetarium.  That is on my must go back for list.   The Star Trek exhibit was good - but I'm a geek, so I wouldn't recommend it for a non-Trekkie.  I thought it was well worth it.  The IMAX was also great - my mom loved it since it was about Santorini, Greece, and she's been there.  

But the highlight for me were the hands on exhibits.  All of them were great - and I actually learned some stuff!  I could go on and on about each of them, but I really think if you like cool stuff, touching things (THINGS, NOT PEOPLE) and have a sense of adventure and wonder, you would really enjoy a day here.

Note:  Until April 2010 you can get up to 4 free admissions with the Culture Pass, I think those are only good for the general admission, I doubt it includes the special parts, but still a great deal!. We love this place. It was our second trip to Il Mulino after a two-year hiatus from Las Vegas. All the tasty nibbles they serve as soon as you sit down are great (parmesano reggiano, salumi, fried zucchini, bruschetta, fresh baked breads). It is expensive but we always feel we receive excellent service and delicious food in large portions. (We'll gladly spend the extra $100 on the tab to feel like we were tried like royalty and enjoyed more than enough food.) They never rush guests here too, which is nice. The ambiance is nice too. Of all the restaurants in Vegas to celebrate our wedding anniversary, we chose this one and it did not disappoint.. I am apologetic for not having updated my review on Yelp for Quick Pic Towing.  I am sure I was angry at the time of my last posting. I still don't know what was with the dispatcher,but am not basing the update of my rating on her. Quick Pic turned out to be an excellent towing company.  It may have taken a little time, but the company paid for the damages done to both the car and the garage.  I would now recommend this company to anyone needing a tow.  I was fortunate to have been assisted by John (part owner) in resolving the issues I had.  John showed that this business truly has high ethical standards.. Love the gluten free aspect. Pepperoni or Veggie is my go too. By the slice, when available... Seems like someone new is always at the register and is slow as molasses. What's up with that Z Pizza? Get on the mailing list. Good stuff!. We rarely go to the movies.  But we were on vacation.  And the theater is so close to our timeshare.  So....what the heck! Let's do it!

AMC has an IMAX theater, and the big screen was showing a just released 3D the night we went.

Loved the theater. The seats were comfy enough. It was clean.  The popcorn smell drove me crazy (dammit). The bathrooms were well maintained. And the movie happened to be great. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney never looked better. Yep. Gravity.

The price for IMAX and 3D will set you back a bit more than average, but for a good hour and a half of intense entertainment, I was quite happy.

Nice theater.. I ordered the Pad Thai to play it safe and hubby had the Basil Fried Rice with Beef.  They give you pretty big portion of food in a large plate or bowl. The food is very good. It's also a female chef so that's a plus. Their Thai tea is excellent. I will go back and try other dishes now.. I actually reviewed Boardhouse awhile back...but I reviewed the one on Maryland Pkwy....while this is actually the one I frequent. This place has delicious sammiches! I usually ALWAYS get the Charlie Tuna. It is the tastiest tuna sandwich I have EVER eaten. Seriously. I go here quite often. It's an albacore tuna salad and there is a mango chutney that comes on the sandwich that is so, so good. The slight sweetness of the chutney blends well with the saltiness of the tuna, finishing with a little bite from the black pepper they shake on top. Not to mention the crunch of the lettuce and the freshness of the tomato...HEAVEN! I never thought any type of fruit with tuna would be tasty...but I went with it and tried it. I did learn the hard way though that if you order the Shortboard Combo you have to ask for mango chutney on the sandwich (an additional 50 cents, but well worth it). Also, when you order the combo it comes on a soft sub roll. If you order just the sandwich it comes on thick cut wheat bread. Go with the sub roll...even if you decide to order just the sandwich...go with the sub roll. It's nice and soft in the middle with a slightly chewy crust. With the sandwich I usually get the potato salad. It's actually pretty good. It's a mayonnaise base (no mustard), with I think dill. I've gotten the coleslaw before, but it's really kind of bland, not bad - just lacking a lot of flavor. Sad, because I usually love coleslaw. The total for the combo, with the potato salad, is always $7.51.

I've also tried their California Veggie sandwich. It's avocado, cucumber, sunflower seeds, monterey jack cheese, sprouts, tomato, red onion, and cream cheese on that thick cut wheat. It was okay...I don't particularly like that bread, so i think it would be better on the sub roll.


Every time I bring back my food to work I convince another person to try Boardhouse and they love it. Most of the meat eaters I know get the Chicken Bruschetta and say it's basically life-changing (okay, so they didn't REALLY say that...but they act like it). It's a warm sandwich top with grilled chicken, bruschetta, melted mozzarella, and pesto mayo.

You won't be disappointed....it's a MUST try! OH, and lest I forget, they have a rewards card that allows you to earn "cash" towards sandwiches every time you order!! I actually had enough points to get myself a free combo meal for lunch today!!!. A random after-work thought boba. I could either workout at the Gold's in the same lot or have empty calories. Empty calories won!

They have flat screen TV's and a few chairs. You basically grab your drink and go. You can't stay here.

They have milk tea, ice milk, smoothies, etc. I double-fisted a Thai Boba Milk Tea and a Green Boba Milk Tea. The tea flavor was pretty strong and less sweet which is rare and is actually prefer it this way. Less sugar is always good. The boba pearls were fresh, hot and soft.

Make sure you grab a stamp card so you can get a free drink after 10 stamps.. Now, I'm going to say something a bit controversial here...I really like Starbucks. I like their coffee, I like their cakes and I like their sandwiches. yeh, that's right.

This Starbucks is about 5 minutes from my University library, so I've spent a bit of time here. Although it is really small, it has a nice layout and the decor is that of your typical Starbucks. The staff are really friendly too - they always offer a free taste of one of their cakes or sandwiches. 
Whenever I've been here, I've always found myself lurking for a free table, and when I do the staff practically pounce on me to clear up the remains of the previous occupant. So it's very clean!!

This is definitely one of the better Starbucks I've been in. The main server, Iain, recently won the regional competition for 'flat white' (I didn't know there was competitions for coffee....it's like Glee with caffeine)  so it's good coffee too!. 94DR is a modern boutique hotel with excellent service.
John and Paul of 94DR are the best hosts! 
They are so accommodating and friendly. We adored Paul and my hubby admitted he had a man-crush on him.
The rooms come in three styles, Couture, Bespoke and Tailored. We stayed in the Lagavulin room on the top floor with a window view of the back garden and hills in the distance. The room was a bit small but comfortable. The bed is probably a full size which might not be ideal for two persons if you are use to more space. 
The spacious bathroom was sleek and modern and the heated floors were perfect for chilly mornings.
The location is a little away from town but you can easily catch a bus in front of the B&B.
DO NOT miss the breakfast here! This is truly a gourmet breakfast served in a most beautiful breakfast room. I had for the first time the traditional Scottish breakfast that came with a poached egg, bacon, sausage haggis and blood sausage. I have to say that I quite enjoyed the haggis. The porridge there is also very good unlike the kind you get in the states.. Came in for the second time after swearing we would not return after the first visit. I'm so glad we did!!! 
The gyros and fries were delicious!  We were not planning on dessert, but the chocolate fudge cake was decedent and EASILY is a treat for two.  
We will surly be back!!!

Peace, Love & Angels. Due Pizzeria, where to start. We were staying at the Bluegreen resort for the first time and saw their flyer in our room. After missing lunch with our friends, we were starving and called down to order. We did walk past the door twice, but then darted in and watched the owner bake our pizzas. He was really nice and chit-chatted with us while we were standing there. I loved the layout of the place. There is nowhere to sit, but he has glass up almost like a sub sandwich place for protection of the food, and so you can see the whole place. It was really neat standing there and watching our pizza cook and brown and watch the owner work the oven. You could tell this is what he does and has a passion for. Here's what we ordered and what we thought:

Cheese Pizza: Simple cheese pizza, done amazingly right. The owner pulled it out of the wood fire oven and it already looked amazing, but then he did a spiral of some kind of sauce. We brought it up to our room and started to devour it. My word, I have never had such a tasteful pizza. It was thin, which I normally don't like, but I loved this one! The flavor of the dough was great, and the wood fire taste imbedded in it was perfect. The cheese, the sauce, I didn't NOT like anything about this pizza.

Pepperoni Pizza: Basically everything I said about the cheese, transfers to the Pepperoni as well. The flavors were amazing and the owner uses little pepperoni's instead of the large ones. I loved them so much! The meat had such great flavor and wasn't spicy like some can be either. I couldn't make up my mind if I wanted the cheese or the pep more. YUM!

While talking with the owner waiting for our pizzas he told us that he special orders his dough from New Jersey because the water here is too hard and doesn't make the dough the same. That information itself shows how much he cares about his product and that he knows his stuff. Every time we go to Vegas we will be stopping by here again. Loved it!. Parlor has become one of my favorites to get pizza. While the dough may not be quite as amazing as at Pizzeria Bianco's it is a close second, and the fact that you do not have to wait 3-4 hours for a table more than makes up for this. 
Whenever we go we make a point to order the Funghi pizza, which never fails to be a favorite among all the people we introduce to the place either. I have also had several of their soups du jour and have never been disappointed. 
The ambiance is nice - I hear that much of the wood has been reclaimed from the beauty parlor days and that is just plain cool.. Wow!  I've lived in Old Town for two years and have never come here before now.  What is wrong with me!!

Fantastic pizza.  At first, I didn't think I would like it as they only serve thin crust.  But the crust is not cracker thin.  It has the chewy doughiness I love with a little pinch of saltiness.  Great selection of toppings.  We had sweet red peppers, basil, garlic, ricotta, and pepperoni (did you know it doesn't have to come in paper thin slices that dry all up?).  A small pizza was enough for my husband and I to share.  Tiramisu was excellent.  You can also watch the coal-fired ovens and hope every pizza that goes in or comes out is yours.

The menu consists only of pizza, calzone, salads, and dessert.  It's also on the expensive side when you load up on toppings.  A small pie, small caprese salad, one glass of wine, and one dessert came to $50.00 and WORTH EVERY PENNY!  Soooo good!. While in Vegas I had the opportunity to stop by VIBE Lash and Wax Studio and get my first set of lash extensions and fell in love with them!! They looked so natural and didn't feel heavy.  I loved them so much I also asked for brow extensions.  Those were also great and very natural looking.  Just perfect for me since I have a small area where hair doesn't grow in my brows. Upon walking in, I was greeted and the waiting area was immaculate and smelled delicious. I received my services promptly (no waiting on someone else).  Josette is very knowledgeable and offered suggestions on how to maintain my lashes and brows.  And for you ladies they also sell the cutest handbags, clutches and wallets!! I highly recommend VIBE and I have already purchased a groupon for my return visit!!!. Came in for breakfast here & it was amazing! We had Christina as our server she was amazing! Very attentive & sweet! We would come back for sure!. Love this place great food love the omelets pastas with shrimp and is only $6.00 then $9.00 for lunch with the player card me and my family always come here the waiters are really nice everyone is excellent I would give 100 stars but I could only give 5. Okay I am going to start out with the steak was really good. However they lost a star because the service could have been better. For a Monday night it took them over an hour to get our order. Our main server totally ignored us most of the night. I guess to make up for that, his serving assistant was very attentive. Well at least most of the food made up for the poor service.

I'd have to say my petite filet was cooked perfectly medium rare. The mac and cheese is really good but somewhat rich and I'd recommend sharing it. In fact, since they are a la carte, most of the side dishes are easily shared between two people. The grilled asparagus with balsamic glaze could have been a bit better. The giant spears they used were tough and woody. My boyfriend ordered the Potatoes Austin. They were sort of like Lyonnaise Potatoes, "but without the bacon" as I was corrected by the server. The last time I looked I had never made it with bacon. Anyway, everyone else at the table got the Porterhouse. My mom said it was terrific, as were the sauteed mushrooms she had as a side dish. Not so good were my uncle's french fries, but I attribute that to him getting french fries at a steak joint. If it had said "steak frites" I would have had a higher standard for them.

I think the entire dining experience was about three hours. The food was good but the service was lacking. I'll say that for being a casino restaurant it was above average. Surprisingly enough the noise from the casino was mostly indiscernible.. So far I really like this school! Very homey, the staff are so welcoming and helpful! I am a single Mom with a full time job so the blended scheduled and night classes work out perfectly!. It's a quiet, they have a wide selection of spirits, wine, cider, and beer. If you want a bar where you can still smoke in, come on by! Friendly staff, clean bathrooms, dim lighting and comfy chairs.. My friend took me here today. First time for me. It was delicious! Everything tasted great, I had the pulled piggy sandwich side of beans and Mac n cheese. My friend had ribs sausage and chicken I tasted his as well and I liked it all except the sausage but that's just me. The bananna bread pudding was really good too my friend raved about it, you gotta try it!  To top off the good food the staff was exceptionally nice and welcoming. They seemed to really care how the costumers were liking their food. They came out and were interacting with everyone and making sure they were satisfied. This place is awesome I would definitely recommend. It would even be great to cater a party! Hope they can make it to the strip .. People would love this place on the strip.. I got a gift card from a coworker, which prompted me to give this place a shot. I had driven past it quite a few times on the way to the gym and always wondered what it looked like inside. Most of the places with labels including "24hr gaming" seem to all fit the smokey neighborhood bar type... Sedona was quite a surprise. 

After we found the turn in, we got a much closer look at the building. Very modern looking and they even have a trendy patio area! While it was too cold to enjoy our dinner outside, after seeing the patio we deemed Sedona worth a return once the weather warms back up. 

Once we got inside, I was pretty blown away. Totally NOT what I expected. It does have the components of a neighborhood bar...but also that of a cozy restaurant with most of the elements needed for a quality date night...which is exactly what we had. Dim lighting and red tons give the place a super sexy feel...but there's also a casual feel with the bar and sports on the few tvs that they have.

We ordered the whiskey and wine drink (where I'm from we call it a Whiskey Rosso)...very tasty! I'm excited to have found a spot that serves this. We also ordered the sliders to start. The sliders were cooked pretty darn close to perfect. Order them as is... I'm not a huge fan of onions but the carmelized onions gave the sliders a nice touch.

For the main corse, my boyfriend ordered the surf n turf and I ordered the salmon dish. The surf n turf was MUCH more turf than surf... you literally get one scallon and one shrimp... so a little disappointment there. The steak was VERY delicious though so they made up for it a little. I would really just order a steak dish on its own in the future though. Their reduction that was served with the steak was pretty incredible, it complimented the steak well. My salmon dish was alright. I'm not entirely sure that I would order it again in the future, but it filled me up at the time. The cream like sauce that was included kind of threw me off the most. I didn't recall reading it in the menu discription so I was kind of taken back when I initially saw it. I still can't decide if it complimented the salmon or made the dish kind of weird. 

I'm likely going to return, so I will update my review with new items that I try...and get the specifics on that salmon dish! ;) This place is definitely worth the stop though, for the record.. Great food & excellent service. Pricing was very reasonable. 
K & K. We have eaten here a couple of times now and it's one of my favourites in Madison. The menu changes frequently so there is no getting bored, and there is a dedicated gluten free menu, which is almost the same as the normal one (ie is not limited to a couple of choices). The food is really good, well-portioned, and fairly priced. The only tiny criticism I had last time is that the GF menu was very fish/shellfish heavy - all of the starters and half of the mains were fish or shellfish.

The wine selection is good and again fairly priced. The cocktails are also really tasty - I wish there were more of them! The service has also been great both times we were there. The setting is lovely - there is a limited view of the city from inside the restaurant but the outside terrace gets some cool views, especially of the capitol. Overall, we love it and we'll be back.. Sarlyn summed it up pretty good.  Basically this show for 2011 could be summed up in a few words.  3D technology, and tablets.

This show was insane.  It was my first time, and while I thought I knew what to expect, I was blown away.  The amount of money thrown into this event is mind boggling.  The various booths had some really amazing stuff and the presentations/demos were excellent.

I was bummed that I missed all the big celebs like Lady Gaga and Common, and didn't get any real swag.  I was hoping to walk away with something really cool. 

The only thing I got from the show was a nasty case of the plague.  If your gonna go, bring anti-bac!. This place is absolutely delicious! Probably the best kabobs hands down! I definitely recommend ANYONE AND EVERYONE to go here! The food was full of flavor and the kabobs were juicy and tender. This place is my go to place! I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND KABOB EXPESS!. These 5 Stars Are for BEWARE NO stop do NOT pass go here. YES the location is prime but that's it. The service is horrible the food is disgusting. STOP now and find a different place. This place is only open because of their location. We arrived and were seated in a corner.....we waited patiently for about 15 minutes and NO ONE came to our table....finally after waiting I decided to go see if they over looked us...they did! An Asian girl with leopard print sweater approached me and said let me help you!! Great! But alas the server came to the table next to us and had a great conversation for 5 more minutes and walked away! Yes the table sat 10 minutes after us got service!!!  This place is not worth your time money or energy. The food sucks and the service is even worse. Go somewhere else like Back stage Deli open 24 hours!. Great pho and fresh spring rolls!. What a delicious and delightful dining experience! 

My husband, myself and another couple met for dinner on a Friday night. We were looking for something a little different and I was intrigued by all the great yelp reviews of Crudo so we decided to give it a try. There was a special wine dinner going on that night (which we did not partake in), so we were a little concerned that it would be really busy and loud. Unfortunately for the restaurant, it wasn't a problem. There were only a couple other tables the whole night. The restaurant shares a space with a little boutique, so the atmosphere was casual and a little funky- in a good way. The staff was friendly, helpful and very attentive. We took our time visiting and ordering slowly and we never felt rushed or neglected. It was still a bit warm outside, so we sat in, but I noticed a lovely patio that will be great once it cools down. 

We started our meal with the Local Farm Cheese plate and a couple glasses of good wine. Then we moved on to the rest. One of our party isn't into eating raw, so she had her own dish- the Mushrooms Au Gratin and was very satisfied. (She doesn't have a big appetite, so if you're hungry you might want to order another small plate to go with it). The rest of us shared 3 Crudos- the Butterfish, Albacore and Hiramasu and 3 Piattis- the Risotto, the Mushrooms and the Gnocchi. All were wonderful, but I'm still dreaming about the Butterfish and the Risotto! Portions are small, but high quality. The only negative is that it is a tad pricey, so I can't go every weekend.. LOVE this place. I need to get my red velvet pancake fix at least once a month. And no better place than this. This location has not done me wrong. The wait isn't as bad as the other location, and all the food has been delicious. From the different pancakes to the skillets and adobo fried rice, everything is yummy.. I am a true Trader Joe's supporter.  The excitement  of shopping here never grows old though I try not to go there on the weekends.  I really enjoy discovering yet another new  product each time I shop and its really encouraging  to know  that I am seldom disappointed.  I especially enjoy the daily  product sampling and promotions they offer their customers.
The store generally has plenty of help on hand for the amount of business they do and the lines at the registers move quickly.. Menu looks awesome! Tuesdays there is $5 wines and kids eat free. Has a funky smell, but it's minor and the place is old. Parking in front is tricky, but plenty of parking in the back. Menu is great for large crowds and plenty of seating throughout. Salmon wrap was just okay, but black and blue burger was amazing!! Kinda divey, but I like it. Seat yourself.. L'un des meilleurs burger que j'ai goûté à montreal, ils ont d'ailleurs aussi ouvert au Maroc. C'est un petit fast-food avec des produits frais et une bonne viande. J'ai toujours du mal avec les burgers à montreal qui ne semble pas avoir de la viande hachée fraîche mais congelée.  Si vous avez des propositions pour d'autres bons burgers à montreal je suis prenante!. Very pleased with my visit here. I called in around 730 pm to pick up. It took only ten minutes for my entire order (fried rice, shrimp lo mein, and orange chicken). I got in and out of the establishment within 5 minutes. While the food was fantastic I might also add that the portion sizes were huge. Will definitely be spending my money here again.. Came here with my bf for a late Valentine's Day dinner and was NOT disappointed.

I've heard a lot about this place through the grapevine and all the pics on yelp made my boo and I want to go here. Their prices are very fair (if not cheap) for the quality of their selections. Their service is really spot on as well. The atmosphere is very modern and casual. It's a perfect date night setting. I can't wait to come back.. Wasn't sure if this was still open, but thankfully it is! Nice ambiance with cool glassed in pizza making area viewable from dining room. Very nice outdoor patio overlooking a beautiful park. Delicious, fresh pizza and the lasagna was also yummy. Nice and prompt server. Would return.. I'm not sure if it's me getting older, or everyone else in Scottsdale getting younger, but it's more of a headache than anything to doll up and go to Old Town these days.The last few times I braved it though I stopped by DJ's and it helped to drown out the background of "Old Town Snottsdale"

DJ's is very relaxed, no heels needed, and the prices are great, or normal at the least. Not $10 a beer like everywhere else. 

It is hard to get past the crowed and the 30 minute find a parking sport ordeal, but if you can survive all that, make sure to hit up DJ's, great drink prices, great patio, clean restrooms..... AND they even have a back door for easy access *tee-hee* from the parking garage.. amazing food!!! I love the cajun spicy shrimp and the fried shrimp as well!! oh and of course the Cajun fries they are amazing on the side!! I love this restaurant, would highly recommend to people who like sea food. A prominent "bridge" from Bellagio to Aria Hotel and Casino. It's my favorite spot in whole City Center now.
However I checked web site and found out that The Cosmopolitan is not a part of City Center at all. In my opinion, it's organically synced with the rest of buildings and is an enticing addition to them. 
I'm staying there next time!
And one more thing, check their packages on web. One I really suggest all my single but cooperative peers is "Three adults for the price of two" night stay.. I was driving one morning,  down Brown rd when we saw their  sign, decided to give them a try, that was like two months ago, and we have been coming here for breakfast at least once a week, i have tried almost everything in there breakfast menu, and everything is delicious. The place is very clean and the people are very friendly, and the prices are good. Great new yoga studio- the instructors are super friendly and the classes are relaxing and challenging. The first class is free, and I went back the next night after trying it out. I also really liked that they keep a couple yoga mats to borrow for free, as this was convenient while I was visiting the area. I wish the studio was closer to where I live, but will be sure to visit next time I'm back in town for work!. Good food, great bbq sauce. Our dinner came out very quickly. Staff was friendly, restaurant clean. Will go back again soon.. At the end of last year, my skin was a disaster. Between the daily heavy makeup necessitated by my job, travel and stress, my jawline was ready to revolt and was actually quite revolting to look at.

Enter Blu Sol and, more specifically, Tiffany.

She saved my skin. There's no two ways about it. Between her soothing touch and the organic products, my face has never looked better. Fair warning, girlfriend takes no prisoners with the extractions. She will squeeze every last bit of gunk out of your pores, so take an aspirin before arrival if you're pain-sensitive.

Front desk staff is lovely, warm and friendly. They always offer that delicious fruity water and lead you into the relaxation room before your treatment. The phone call reminding you of your appointment the day before is a nice touch, too. Well worth the price - do the monthly auto renew.. I hated Cosmo's Wicked Spoon, so I was worried about risking so much money to be disappointed again ... but sweet watermelon minty jesus, Bacchanal Buffet was EXCELLENT!  I paid $48 for dinner on Tuesday night, and waited about half an hour to get in at 5:30, and ten minutes to get seated.

My gal pal and I take turns going up for food, so one stays with purses, and we each fill a plate with small bites of things to try.  For example, I make a plate and bring it back, she takes bites of anything she's interested in, then she goes up to fill a plate while I eat the rest.  It's a great way for us not to waste a bunch of food, and we get to share opinions bite by bite -- then make a second or third trip to get more of what we liked best.

For me, the best dinner item was the sweet potato tater tots.  The skin is crispy, the inside gooey, and they're glazed with a salty sweet syrup caramelized shell.  So simple, and yet ... amazeballs!  I also high five the staff for their excellent ceviche, chicken marsala, spicy fried fish, and charcuterie.  One slice of ribeye steak was great, but the next was fatty and awful (the flank steak too.)  I was so-so on the lamb, and the other veg choices.

Next time I'll remember to leave LOTS of room for dessert, and FILL UP on watermelon mint sorbet.  Maybe the best dessert ever?  Tho I'm usually gaga for french macaroons and mochi.  But I prefer mochi in mango, which they skipped ... and their macaroons had great shells, but the inner cookie was too moist, and too much filling, too thick.  The center should be like a sweet adhesive only, not a thick band of firm chocolate ganash.  Generally too much sugar in most of the desserts, and tho some say the dinner is overly salty as well, I like salt and thought everything had the right levels.

If I have guests in town who want the best buffet and can afford a real treat, I would def go back.  :-D. I have found that win or loose their games are super entertaining.  Living downtown I starting just attending a few games here and there....and for the 2010-11 season I took the plunge and got me just one REALLY GOOD season seat in The Club.  I am just 18 rows up from the court.  You'll find me there with my jersey or my cap, keeping the Suns in check, shouting "Defense" or hollaring at the officials for bad calls.  
GO SUNS!!. My husband and I decided that we would get a real tree this year for the first time ever.  After reading the history on Deerbrooke Farm, we decided that we would try them for our first tree.  We went around lunch time on a Tuesday almost 2 weeks ago.  We were the only people there but were immediately greeted.  One of the guys explained the different trees, sizes, quality and everything they had to offer.  There was a huge selection of trees and several guys (firefighters) were getting dozens more ready.  We walked around looking and comparing for about 30 minutes and we were asked several times if we had any questions.  We finally decided on a tree and a couple of the guys immediately came over to help us.  They trimmed the tree down and made sure that we were happy with the overall appearance of it.  We purchased a stand and they put it on the tree while we paid.  Our tree is about 9 ft and with the tree, a stand (that we were told has a life time guarantee) and a tree disposal bag ran us about $120, which we were very happy with.  They tied it down to our SUV and explained that we needed to water it within an hour.  The guy went over a couple more things and wished us a merry christmas.  

While looking at trees, there was a couple that came in and was complaining about the prices.  The couple did ask if Deerbrooke carried any cheap trees.  The response was they have fresh cut trees and that if they wanted a "cheap tree, they could find that at home depot.' The response was accurate, humorous and very effective. All of the trees that we saw were reasonably priced for the size and the quality.   

Almost 2 weeks later, our tree still looks great.  It sheds a little but not enough to take away from the fullness of our tree.  We recently went back to get a second, smaller tree from them.  We will definitely visit Deerbrooke again!. Escobar's just opened a few months ago, and it's far enough off the beaten path that I imagine they're missing out on walk-in traffic.  I've only had brunch there, so I can't comment on the rest of the menu.  The brunch menu isn't too breakfast-y, but the options are tasty, and the portion sizes aren't ridiculous.  Our service the first time was excellent, and the second time, despite an almost empty dining room, our service was so-so.  The interior is gorgeous, especially the bathrooms.  I wish the menu changed more regularly, but they're new - this will improve in time.. I absolutely love the Venetian. Gorgeous, elegant, huge rooms. I love that the bed is separated by a railing and/or stairs. Dining and entertainment are both spectacular. Pictures on yelp say everything you need to know.. That perfect haircut and stylist is like that perfect pair of jeans or big foot or the loch ness monster. Super elusive or may not even exist.

 Shine proved me wrong. 

Not only is the salon fabulous, chic and clean but they were gracious, kind and made my experience wonderful. 

Often, I find myself apologizing for my curly monster hair at salons but Shine and my stylist James worked with me to make my time there worthwhile. He even moved back an appointment in order to finish up my cut and style (so sorry!) but I appreciated not being handed off. He spent nearly two hours with me recommended products, but not in that pushy car salesman way and discussed how we can both work together for my hair success- sigh. #girlproblems. 

The best part of my visit to Shine (other than the followup phone call from James later that day to see how my hair dried and if I was happy with my look)- was the price. You can be pampered and pleasantly surprised.  Don't tell the owners but I would have paid double for that experience. I have already made an appointment to go back in eight weeks.. I love luci's :)

The staff is always upbeat and helpful!!!
The food is super fresh!!!
And I love the atmosphere!
One of my top coffee shops in Phoenix!!. Nady makes me want to move to Vegas! What a gem! We ended up staying for hours just because her energy and drinks are by far the best thing in the whole casino! She invented a drink called the black swan and I think it would make an amazing martini or shot! We did not eat any food but it looked pretty! The dragon berry tea is scrumptious and the margaritas are spectacular!!. One arepera is plenty for lunch. They're super filling and the guasacaca sauce is amazing. You can purchase it if you like it.. I just moved to Nevada from Phoenix so I do not have a vet established yet. My Degu Hammy was sick and so I needed to get him into an exotic animal hospital ASAP. 

The receptionist Lexie (hope I spelled it right) was super kind and understanding over the phone. I had a feeling my Hammy wasn't going to make it so I expressed euthanasia might be his unfortunate outcome. She said to bring him in. 

As soon as I arrived I filled out a couple of papers for Hammy and Lexie put us into a room immediately. Dr. Lopez saw Hammy. I was a hot mess (crying a lot) and he was extremely patient and understanding. Since Hammy was really ill (he was in pain) I did make the decision to put him to sleep. Dr. Lopez put mind at ease about my decision which helped. I filled out the paperwork and was given as much time as I needed with Hammy. Lexie explained the process, options and was very empathetic. 

It is never an easy decision to have your pet put to sleep but when you have the support and empathy that I got at Park Animal hospital it eases the pain. Thank you Lexie and Dr. Lopez you truly are compassionate for what you do.. We came for a late breakfast early lunch, the service was slightly slow but the food was delicious and definitely worth the wait.
We order the Mexico,Italy,Germany and the Europa all  crepes were delicious great flavor.
We will be back for sure ;). Went for lunch with my mom one day this week. Was excellent! Had chicken and fish tacos. Mom had the salmon salad which she also loved! 
Wonderful environment and zack was our waiter. He was so nice and sweet. Helped due with recommendations and we were very happy. Margarita was also great! Can't wait to come back!. Disgustingly good cupcakes.

Even if I am on a diet, I can't resist eating one when someone brings them into the office.  Yes, they are pricey, but I feel that it is the ridiculously overpriced items like these that just make you feel special when someone gives you one.  I can honestly say I have never bought one myself but I do occasionally stop by for a free one when they do their "secret word" thing on Facebook.. One of my new favorites.  I've been twice now- once for lunch and once for dinner- and have been very impressed by the service. The waitstaff has been extremely helpful, knowledgeable about the menu (both beer and food) and very attentive.

My favorite thing on the menu so far has to be the Flat Iron Quesadilla.  I wasn't that excited about it when I ordered (I planned to share with my mom, and that's what she wanted) but I was extremely impressed.  It's not your typical quesadilla- it comes deconstructed and has components like bleu cheese and roasted garlic vinaigrette.  At the risk of sounding like a total weirdo, I have to confess that I have been thinking about this quesadilla A LOT and cannot wait to go back and have it again! :)

The beer is good and the atmosphere is very modern and chill.  I'd definitely recommend this place and I will be back again soon!. In my trinity of favorite Pittsburgh Indian restaurants, India Garden holds the title of "best buffet" for sure - there is nothing more relaxing than wandering in on a Sunday afternoon for great Indian comfort food with Bollywood or cricket playing on the TV.  Lots of people have the same idea, so the food on the buffet turns over pretty quickly, and they have a good variety (Do you like goat curry? They have that.) which changes slightly from week to week, so THEORETICALLY you could eat here several weekends in a row and not get bored. Theoretically.  Is the food super-spicy? No, but it is incredibly tasty, and the whole experience feels very comfortable - we've never had an issue with service because we've never come here for a meal off the menu - just buffet. And have been very happy every time.  Maybe that's the secret.

The biggest inconvenience is not the crazy parking on Atwood, it's that India Garden recently changed their weekend buffet hours so they close for a brief period between lunch and dinner. Plan on lunch around lunchtime and you'll be fine.. Je passe souvent devant le David's tea sur Mont-Royal lorsque je me rend chez  ma coiffeuse qui a son salon juste un peu plus loin.

Un jour j'ai décidé d'arrêter et d'essayer un bon thé latté. La fille au comptoir a été vraiment gentille et a vraiment pris son temps pour évaluer mes goûts. Je suis finalement allée avec un poire/canneberge au lait de soya. SUPER BON et frais. Surtout avec un peu de sirop d'Agave... (sucre naturel)

La deuxième fois j'y suis allée avec quelque chose d'un peu plus terreux, soit le ' île de rêve ' en latté avec lait régulier. SUPER BOOOOOON. Un petit goût tout discret de coco. 

Staff super gentil et serviable, variété de thé sans fin, petite boutique avec accessoires pour se faire du thé a la maison, j'aime bien cet endroit ! Prochaine fois je devrai goûter leur thé glacé. Les saveurs d'été sont particulièrement fraîches et servies sur glace.. Happy client here!! 
To start off, I initially went to the old location about 6 months ago in search of someone who could assist me with a question I had about a piece of jewelry I owned. Both guys were nice and informative and they didn't charge me anything to look at it and answer my questions. Upon being there they informed me about their business and how it saves their clients money and how it's worked for them for so many years. I mentioned that I would be looking for diamond earrings in the next year or so and would keep them in mind. 
Well, fast forward 8 months and I yelped "diamonds" and saw them again. So I called and spoke w Dave about what I wanted. He was very informative while not being pushy at all, in fact he helped me scale down certain criteria he thought I didn't need to waste my money on. Two days later he had 4 pairs of diamond earrings for me to look at in their office. He showed them all to me without saying anything about price, or quality so my eyes could do the judging. After telling him my favorite he told me his two favorites. No where in this process was I pushed into something pricier or encouraged to get something bigger. He gave me honest advice the whole way in how he would steer his "sister" if she were purchasing. The two things I noticed the most from my experience with Jewelers was one, he didn't ask what my budget was. He asked what I would like and delivered that with the confidence that his prices would be competitive(and they were) and two, he didn't ask what my husband and I did for a living. My pet peeve in sales is when they ask you what job you do like it should qualify you to spend like a maniac if you have a good paying job. 
At no point did I feel like Dave was a "salesman."  He felt more like a friend who had an "in" with good prices on diamonds and passed that on to me. I am very happy I stumbled upon D and R and HIGHLY recommend. I can't wait for my earrings to be set! Thank you Dave and D and R!!!!!. I just popped my smashburger cherry!

There's been so much hype that I had to try it.  I ordered the mushroom burger.  They technically have 3 sizes - kids, regular and big smash.  The mushroom burger has garlic, mushrooms, swish cheese on an egg bun.  I held the mayo.  The burger was real juicy and cooked medium.  I wish the egg bun was toasted as it was softer than I'm used to but since it was obviously fresh it didn't hurt.

Note - you can make your own burger and there's a menu with a slew of free sauces and toppings.  That'll be my next burger.

What put me over the top was their smashfries.  Wow.  Rosemary, olive oil and garlic.  I wish it was served a bit more crispy as I prefer my fries more well done but the flavor was incredible.  I'll just ask for it well done next time.   My next fries order will be the truffle fries.  I'm drooling already.

The service was quick.   You order at the counter and they bring it to you.  Very low key but it's reflected in their decent prices.. Had a GREAT night at Jack Beagles- there was a band playing Saturday and the place was rockin. This is our new favorite bar.. I avoided this place for quite some time because the exterior comes across very much like a dive bar. I gave in last night due to a sticky rice craving and was pleasantly surprised. The interior was a beautiful, cozy little restaurant. The servers were very pleasant but could have been a bit more attentive. The service was slow overall but still very good. The portions were good and food was very fresh but could use a little more kick of flavor. Overall, I was very satisfied with my visit and I'm looking forward to many more visits in the future.. Quick, delicious and authentic Coffee and Crepe Shop. We ordered a regular cup of coffee. large fresh squeezed orange juice, a butter and sea salt crepe, a cinnamon and butter crepe and the ham and gouda crepe. Everything was hot and delicious. If you live in Madison, you should make this a regular stop.. We will be back to visit.. Unless you're one of those weirdos who doesn't love chocolate, you'll absolutely love this place. In fact, if you've been in Edinburgh for more than a day then you'll probably have already been.

It's a simple but amazing concept - just like a regular coffee place/café, but the emphasis is almost entirely on chocolate. I've never seen so many different types of sundaes/chocolatey coffees/chocolate muffins/pain au chocolats under one roof, and despite my best efforts I've yet to sample them all.

If you're trying to convince yourself to be healthy, they also have freshly made porridge every day, as well as one of those granola-in-a-glass smoothies. But you can have all that at home. 

Make sure you try their namesake drink. Or dish... their chocolate soup is so gloopy and amazing I'm not sure whether you eat it or drink it, but whichever it is it's definitely worth the calories. Just make sure you only order a shot of it, and not the large shot like I did... it's very filling and no, you won't be able to finish it without feeling sick for hours. A very happy sick, but sick nonetheless.

Why only 4 stars then? Out of sympathy for the poor staff. The last two times I've been here I've heard the manager-ess/owner absolutely laying into the other members of staff for something or another. Everyone else in the queue behind me looked just as awkward as I felt!. The purple rice was a nice surprise on the Arizona roll that my son ordered. Kind of an unassuming decor and you might just pass by and not even notice it but the food was delish! Worth stopping in for lunch. The worst thing in the world is buying a bottle of wine and it just not being what you thought it would be. Well the Wine Store takes the guessing game out of it.  The have several bottles you can sample for a small fee. Plus they are extremely knowledgable and always recommend a great bottle.. Love this place! Second time in a week coming here. The Original Bibimbap is amazing and portion is huge. Love the banchan assortments and their bulgogi is excellent!. Lived here for 3 years and for the most part it was a great experience. The best thing about this highrise is the 24 hour patrolling security!! Eddie and his team are incredible and really care about the safety of the tenants. Security was a phone call away and they make sure that no unwanted visitors are in the building and if  there is an issue you can call security instead of calling the police since who knows how long they will take to respond. The building is dog friendly with the 2 parks and they have a strict rule that all dogs must be kept on a leash for the safety of tenants and other resident dogs. The movie theater was an awesome feature and felt very luxurious to just go downstairs when you are at home. The gym is nice and clean, the pool and the spa are always pristine. Another great feature is that the concierge is there to receive all of your packges and shipments so you never have to worry about someone stealing your packages.The units are spacious and upgraded and all utilities are included except for power. Yes, even cable tv and internet are included. Best deal in town. Would have been nice to have linen closets and a pantry, but the oversized balconies are huge and offer a great view! Great place to live with an amazing security team!!. One of the best Thai in the valley!  I'm not sure how high it would be on the authentic Thai scale; however, they have some yummy creative dishes . . .crispy basil chicken.  A friend got the Bombay curry and Thai ice tea, which she thought was delicious.  Surprisingly, there was no wait on a Saturday night.  Ambiance was great.  The menu had a wide variety of dishes.. I am very excited about Bar Marco.  We stopped by for pre-dinner drinks (excellent), and will definitely be back to sample the food and more drinks.

The interior is minimalist but with some fun art on the wall.  Rumor has it that upstairs is going to become a gallery with wine bar, which should make for a very cool space.

Our server was super friendly and attentive, the menu and cocktail list was explained in detail and with enthusiasm, and even though we were there briefly, we were made to feel very welcome.  The patatas bravas were excellent, as were the manhattan and gimlet.  

This will be our new go-to place.  And I'm very happy about that!. FedEx, as a company should be proud of this location! The staff is absolutely phenomenal. They consistently go out of their way to ensure the costumers' shipping needs are well taken care of. 

Today, Brittany and Glenn helped me ship a precarious amount of items. They quickly assessed the situation, offered to repack *everything* for me, and didn't even make me feel like it was any trouble for them, at all. I'm sure it was a lot of work, but they didn't make it seem like an inconvenience. I'm absolutely blown away. 

Expectations always exceeded at this FedEx location!. After we adopted our little friend last month, we went there for our first check up and glands cleaning. All staff was really nice, and we really liked Dr. Inna :) And the atmosphere inside is really warm)

We definitely will be back very soon for a dental cleaning. Thank you Warm Hearts!). Amazing food! Crab legs are to die for but the service sucks!!! It seems like all the employees here are deaf!   this place would have 5 stars if the employees could check on us once in a while. Took forever to waive someone down!!!. Great family owned restaurant. Amazing food! Quaint atmosphere, cutely decorated and casual. This place is good for take out as well.. Good, solid meal here. It's very much a traditional French restaurant without too much creative going on on the menu, but everything was executed very well.

We started with a cheese/meat board that had a good variety of components. We then did the steak tartare and the escargot, followed by the mussels. Everything was delicious. My only complaint would be that the broth for the mussels was somewhat bland, but the mussels were plump and fresh. I also thought the frites were just okay.

I honestly don't have much to say about this place because there just wasn't anything to really RAVE about, however if you're visiting Montreal and want some French food at an affordable price, it's a good pick!. I recently got married on June 20, 2015 and was set up with Shutterbooth through one of the catering coordinators at my venue. Most of the guests loved the booth but some forgot to jump in and missed out. It was an overall success that many people raved about wanting one in their house! They provided a lot of fun props and also made a memory book of all the photos that were taken. The booth also provided copies to the guests with a personalized logo for our wedding at the bottom. Not only that they also provided the pictures on a drop box for my reference. The girl that was working the booth was friendly and the package that I chose was fairly priced. I would definitely use them again!. Cheap and convenient way to travel up and down the Strip ($8 for a 24 hour ticket). I only took it twice, but both times it was very comfortable (I expected it to be hot and packed, it was not, but this was January). It's supposed to run about every 15 min. Dr. Yates and the staff at Pet Medical Center have done an excellent job of helping us to find a solution to our pets persistent medical issue. They have taken all the steps necessary to handle the problem once and for all and have demonstrated great empathy for our situation and financial burden. They are professional, friendly, and the clinic is amount the most efficient in Las Vegas,. It is a rare event when you get a first class gourmet experience for a steal. At Jumping Rice, I ordered a deep fried veggie roll, and my taste buds were on one. My brother ordered the Phili roll, sans salmon, and he couldn't even be bothered with conversation. Suffice it to say that you will be hooked after 1 visit.. drove 20+ mins for these tacos (to try for the first time) i was craving some homemade tortilla tacos and it was worth it. I order a chorizo (not in the menu) taco and they gladly made it for me. I will definitely be back. 
one thing i wish they had *handmade agua fresca* 
maybe in the future abuela's tacos? maybe. Awesome service the people are very personable and nice.. The prices are fair and it's not too expensive. I got a full set and a pedicure. I am very happy with how everything turned out. I would definitely go back again!. One of my favorite hometown pizza places. Try the white pizza, you won't be disappointed. Great place to grab a beer on Beverly road and catch up with old friends.. Can I live here? Seriously...I think I can stay hidden in the wave room or salt room when they're closing up. They have plenty of produce, water, teas and I'd definitely stay clean what with the 10 different types of showers they have there. Hmmmm...brain. wheels. turning. 

But enough about my plan to relocate to Canyon Ranch - I came here with 3 of my gals on a Friday before our weekend of debauchery (need to get those toxins out to make room for the other toxins I was about to imbibe). We all got a Rue La La coupon which was a great deal ($75 for $125). I applied it towards a massage ($165 value) at 2pm. We arrived early at 11am to check in and grab lunch at the cafe -- then we entered the spa. Something is in the air there - or maybe it's the croc like sandals and giant robes or the fact we're not allowed to have our cell phones as we meander about - but I haven't been that relaxed in awhile. We hung out in the relaxation room first, had some tea, grabbed a few bananas (ok more than a few - I stashed some in my locker for later :P)...soon my massage therapist came and got me. She was very sweet and toured me through the whole spa (I had no idea so many saunas existed: Herbal, Cold, Finnish, Steam, etc...). We got to her room and I had 50 minutes of massage bliss. I almost fell asleep and I never fall asleep through massages bc quite frankly I am uptight...like OCD uptight. That's how relaxing the environment is - a crazy uptight me could actually let my mind go blank for a few seconds. 

After that, all us girls met up in the relaxation room, hydrated, stocked up on more produce (I'm cheap...bananas at Coffee Bean cost $2.00!) and proceeded to experience every room or thing they had to offer: rain shower (that will wake you up for sure), sauna, steam room, wave room, salt room, jacuzzi, some redonk cold shower area. After we all took a shower (private shower stalls with all the amenities) and then relaxed a bit more before leaving around 5 (you get access all day for the day of your service). 

Seriously one of the most fun and relaxing days I've ever had. If you see a coupon out there do it! Treat yourself and don't freak out if you see me hiding behind your chair in the wave room if it's around closing time - it's just me putting my relocation plan into action.. I am a fan of this restaurant and visit it pretty often when we are rehearsing at OLOV up the hill.  The sushi is great and the portions are huge!  I usually order ginger chicken and broccoli - it's not on the menu but they are always happy to make it for me.  The service is amazing and fast!  I wish I could get take out from this restaurant but, alas, I live too far away.  I highly recommend Red Tea House.. It was great, good and fast service, the prices were right and the poutine was good. Hamburger was small, but heavy and the pogo was served with a curried ketchup, mmmm mmmm good!!!. This low-key cafe has excellent service with super friendly help and delicious food. The baba-ganouch and hummis were flavorful and plentiful. The lentil soup is absolutely the best ever. Go with the recommendations of the wait staff, they know what they are talking about. Yum :). J'y suis allée pour le brunch. L'assiette de fruits avec fromage blanc était un peu chère, mais les beignets étaient parfaits. Je vais certainement y retourner. Service chaleureux.. Cornish Pasty just keeps getting better and better!  I love the original Tempe location, but the new one in Scottsdale is just perfect!  It still has a lot of the low key, hipster flare as the original, but it's slightly less grungy and easier to hang out for a while.  The space is great with lots of options for outdoor, bar, and table seating.  I like the vibe a lot and it's a nice alternative to the yuppy scottsdale area.  The food is still the same great fare!  As I've mentioned before, I'm a big fan of the veggie options because they use great tasting meat substitute that is such a treat to have at a restaurant.  I eat meat, but these veggie options taste nearly the same.  Some of my favorites are the spicy asiago chicken, spicy bbq chicken and salmon.  The soups are also delicious!. Yes I know, you have a long wait to get a table. But all good things come to those who wait. And everything about this place is good! The salads, the antipasto, the pizzas. I love it all. The Bianco Verde is my favorite...followed by the Rosa. My mouth watters just thinking about it. The crust is crisp and chewy and the topings are always balanced perfectly. Staff was always friendly and inviting and remembers you. The drink menu is good and if you do not find what you like there you are more then welcome to get a drink at the bar next door and bring it over. 

Before I moved from Phoenix this was one of the only places I wanted to go to eat. I will miss it greatly and cannot wait untill I visit again to have my taste buds pleased in the way only Bianco's can do!. What an adventure. Jerry and Tony were great! Don't bring a bag if you can help it. I made the mistake of bringing my handbag but had nowhere to put it (should've known better). They let me lock it up in the truck before I started the tour. It stayed safe; but don't bring a bag if you can help it... You won't need it anyway. The provide water on the tour and also after the tour. You're gonna get VERY dirty/dusty, I suggest wearing pants (thank goodness I wore pants). I had a great time, thanks guys!!!. one of my favorite japanese restaurants in vegas!

shizen is family owned by some folks from hawai'i and they really brought their japanese/hawaiian fusion dishes to the mainland. 

they have great rolls, a tasty wakame salad, delicious buttah fish, and some yummy sake. 

my family and i go at least once a month to visit our friends and enjoy a wonderful meal. the best part about it is they are located 7 minutes from the house. sWwwEEeeettTt!. Typical In N Out, the lines are long during peak hours, but not as bad as some other locations. Service is friendly per usual and special orders are welcome. I'm one of the weird ones that prefers hamburgers to cheeseburgers and grilled onions are a must. 

Going before or after peak hours is optimal.. Amazing place for a gathering!!!! The food was yummy. The staff were absolutely wonderful! Top notch! Love, love, love this place!. This place is the coolest!!  I LOVED the décor, the food, the vibe and every single thing in the adjoining gift shop, too...I could have spent hours up in there....

Came here for breakfast with my husband during our recent anniversary trip in Vegas.  What actually prompted us to eat in the restaurant was my stop in to buy one of their kick-ass t-shirts in the gift shop the day before.  When the girl gave me my receipt she said that if we brought it back the next day we could get 2-for-1 breakfast.  AWESOME!!  : )

So we came back the next morning and sat in their little bar seating area to have breakfast.  I ordered the Traditional French Toast and the hubby ordered a Breakfast Burrito that had eggs, chorizo, chiles, onions and cheese in it.  Both were SOOO FREAKIN' GOOD!!   Nothing particularly special in the preparation....just simply some tasty ass food!  

The whole time we were there we kept checking out the cool paintings on the walls and all the Day of the Dead style skull décor...love that stuff.  We took a bunch of pictures, too.  

I would love to come back again and try the Southern/Cajun style food they have for lunch and dinner....YUM....maybe check out a show there too!  ; ). This is "our spot". Our go to date night place. We've been coming here since we were in high school, class of '99, so...that's quite some time. Gosh, now I feel old. 

There are several reasons why this continues to be a favorite of ours. 

First, the neighborhood is utterly charming. An old home converted into a restaurant is adds a bazillion points to character of the restaurant. It's not brand spanking new. Nothing's been razed to the ground and rebuilt in that new minimalist style. I'm a big fan of repurposing without losing the original charm. I love love love that this place is still in a house. Take a chance to walk around the neighborhood if you like old historic homes. Some of the architecture will bring a tear to your eye. 

Second, live jazz band. Do I need to say more? There's something about a live band at a restaurant. It provides an old world elegance. I feel like I've taken a step back in time. Like I'm Dolly in the classic movie "Hello, Dolly" and Louis Armstrong is about to serenade me while walking to my table. 

Third, the upstairs bar and patio. One of my favorite things to do is get there 15 or 20 minutes earlier then our reservation and hang out at one of the tables in the bar. We order a plate of fried oysters with remoulade sauce, a couple drinks and just enjoy the atmosphere till our table is ready. We've had some of the best conversations just leaning against the counter sipping on sweet tea and munching on oysters. 

Fourth, is the bread. Once you make it to a table (be sure to make a reservation or you will wait forever especially peak times on the weekend) you will be blessed with a basket of hot rolls. These rolls are the perfect combination of crisp and chewy. I believe they come from Nova's bakery, or at least that is what I've been told by the waitstaff. It's rare to get bread service at a non Italian restaurant or chain steakhouse. Again, it's a throwback to old classics and deserves a hand clap! The only bummer is the butter. It comes ice cold which makes it difficult to spread. 

Fifth, is the food. I could say that food should be in the number one spot, but all these things listed prior are working together in its favor and is why this place is our favorite. The food here is a delight. I love heat and all things spicy. However, when they use spice, it doesn't over power the flavor. It isn't just spicy. It's packed full of flavor with a bit of heat that catches you at the end. One of my favorites is the chicken Diane. Sometimes I switch it up and get shrimp Diane or all 3 Diane (which is chicken, shrimp and crawfish). The Diane is rich and flavorful with mushrooms floating in buttery goodness. It is all things pleasurable. It is a mouthful of happiness and rainbows. Seriously, it's really good. If you are not a fan of garlic and mushrooms, then do not order this. Also, plan on smelling like garlic for a day or two after eating this. No vampire will want to come near you and your lover may avoid your kisses if you don't pop a mint. Trust me. Dragon breath is imminent. 

The blackened chicken is well seasoned and not dried out. It is hard to blacken chicken breast meat and still have it juicy but they nail it every time. The blackened catfish is a favorite and is a huge portion. In fact, almost all the dishes here are giant and unless you are The Rock (can you smell what The Rock is cookin'?), you might be taking home a box or two of leftovers.

Definitely try the fried oysters with remoulade. They are lightly breaded and fried. Every time we visit we just have to order them. They are tender and sweet. Perfect start to the meal. 

I've had the gumbo a couple of times as a starter. I love gumbo and the one here is good. It's not the best gumbo I've ever had but it's not the worst. I like okra and andouille sausage in addition to the shrimp and I don't think I've ever had a bowl with any of those in it. However, the rice is perfectly cooked every time. So, the gumbo might be a gamble. 

They do have a decent Ceasar salad for a starter. Nothing fancy. Just a good salad. 

I'm usually too full for dessert, but we have had the bread pudding and the key lime pie. Both are a great way to end the meal but I'd rather have the plate of oysters. 

For all the reasons stated above, this place holds the number one spot in our date nights. Cajun Queen Forever!! 

P.s. - I miss seeing queen gator. :*(. Wow. I really, really love Lazy Jane's. The scones really are THAT good and there is truly nothing better than waving that big Bakery Express Wand to get them. And coffee snobs may think it's trashy, but I am so glad they have hazelnut coffee.

The key to Lazy Jane's is to go very early on the weekend or really, any time during the week - it's small! Last week, I brought in Lazy Jane's scones for my office and I think I'm now everyone's favorite co-worker. I never noticed a bad attitude from the staff or fellow patrons. I wish I had kids so they could play in the adorable kid nook upstairs with toys, books and comfy couches! 

If you do insist on a late morning meal with a party larger than 2 on the weekend but can't handle the line, here are my tips to deal with it: check out the board, decide what you want, tell the designated "order-er" of your party, go grab a seat, and be happy.. Excellent service and obviously, the food was spectacular. Our waiter answered all questions and was extremely knowledgable of almost every menu item.. Great breakfast place 
Love the skillet egg options 
Great ambiance and very clean
The manager was very courteous as was the server they made sure we were ok and were enjoying our meal. My go to breakfast spot for sure in Vegas ! Pls open in Toronto !. Super delicious cheesesteaks.  The location is clean and tastefully decorated.  The bread was awesome.  Their fries are dynamite (malt vinegar and fry sauce are the way to my heart). We ordered a mini cheesesteak for our daughter and for free they upgraded her to a regular sized, great customer service.  We will definitely be back soon!. Great food and love their menu for my pooch! This is our 3rd time in two weekends! Really like the wait staff and atmosphere. Will keep coming back!. Love Snooze!!!!  The food is awesome, great variety, Gluten free options!!
This location is so much better than having to go all the way to the camelback location. Have not yet had to wait for a table, but then again, once the snowbirds show up and clog up the area I'm sure we will have to wait...lol.....happens every winter. 
One thing that would be nice is if the outdoor space had more of a canopy over the tables to avoid the birds pooping on things, and possibly your meal..... When you sit outdoors make sure you are right under an umbrella to reduce the chances of this happening.. We had our Nissan Versa AC switch replaced in CA & they messed up the heater controls etc.  We took it in to Mitchell today & he found the problem & repaired the AC system for $217.00!  We are thrilled to find an honest garage and whole heartedly recommend this shop!. I loved the sandwiches at the Mesa Capriottis, so I decided to try one of the North Scottsdale locations for lunch. I phoned in my order, and although it was a little hard to understand the gentleman on the phone becausehewastalkingreallyfastlikehowIamwriting, I had no problems getting my order in. 

When I arrived, my sandwiches hadn't been made quite yet, but it didn't take too long for them to finish making them. The "small" 9 inch size is huge! If I weren't such a pig, I could have been satisfied with half of my small size sandwich. 

I love their faux turkey sandwiches, so I went for the regular vegetarian turkey sandwich. The ingredients were fresh, and while I liked the cole-turkey version better, it was pretty good, and especially refreshing for a hot summer day!

The soda fountain has Pepsi products, and has diet Mountain Dew as well as diet Pepsi.

Overall, a good choice for a sandwich.. West coast's Panera Bread!  What's NOT to lve!. Delicious beer, great local atmosphere, super friendly staff! Hopefully the area gets built up around the booze district and I will be a frequent customer! Nice job Craft Haus!. This is a great restaurant! It is always packed, and the staff is SO accommodating! They have seating up front for those waiting to be seated, and a fair amount of space outside if you want to wait outside. Generally, the wait time is super quick though. 

The food always comes out really fast, and is always good. The coffee cake is a must, and so is the fresh squeezed orange juice! All the wait staff is pleasant, which is so nice. 

This restaurant is one of my favorites in town. :). STK is located in the Cosmopolitan. It is so delicious!  If you're looking for a good place to eat and don't mind spending the money, try this place out. 

After you order your food, they bring out some house bread which was pretty good. For appetizer, I shared the Tuna tartare. It was so good but the portion is pretty small.  It's good to share maybe with 1 other person. I shared the bone in rib steak (20 oz) and good thing I shared because both me and my sister couldn't even finish our own half!  The steak was sooo good. It was so flavorful without a topping or sauce. It was charred perfectly. Probably one of the best steaks I've eaten.  We also ordered the trio mac n cheese which was off the menu. It was regular mac n cheese, lobster, and truffle. This was good enough for 4 people. My favorite was the truffle mac n cheese.  We also shared the Brussels sprouts with bacon, also off the menu, and it was delicious. Just an FYI, the trio mac n cheese is $55. 

We also got drinks which were on the pricey side. 

Service was on point. Our server was really nice and the food came out quick.. The Egg and I is truly the BEST BREAKFAST in Las Vegas ! !  Food is HELLA GOOD and the wait staff, especially our server Kelcey, were very attentive.  The restraunt was very busy as it was Sunday mid-morning, but they were very speedy without rushing people to get out. The Chile Rellano omellet was delicious !  I'm going back again tomorrow ! !. And the academy award for best brunch in Vegas goes to the Border Grill in Mandalay Bay. Absolutely freaking knock-me-over amazing,,,,I kid you not!!!
With all the places I checked out in Vegas during my one week stay this was the place that impressed me the most. 

First off the patio is so cool overlooking the lazy river pool; one of the nicest pools in Vegas btw....perfect breeze, lovely day and fantastic service. 

It is an all you can eat and there is a long list of tapas from which to choose from. I tried about 3/4's of the list and each one that came out just got better and better. Far too many to mention just try them all you will not be disappointed. My faves were the empanadas, skirt steak and the potato tacos....wow!!! What a refreshing concept to the typical brunch. 

Check it out; it really was all that and much much more.. We came after the kitchen closed and they still made food for us!  I felt bad but I'm a customer for life now!  The surprise cocktail of the day sounded suspicious, like frat party jungle juice, but it's actually really good!. This studio is great! Clean, great staff and a variety of classes! One of the best studios I've been to! I highly recommend. I stopped in to get take out on my way home one afternoon after noticing they had opened. The employees were all very friendly and i liked the fact that the kitchen is open so you can watch how they prepare the food. Everything is made fresh daily. I ended up trying the vaca frita (the shredded tri tip) and though I have never had Cuban food before so I have nothing to compare it too, I thought it was very good. I know my husband and kids will like it when I go back with them next time.. Very good steak house!  Great side choices as well.  Slim wine choices but the wine I had was good.  Service is perfect!  I do feel like you are scrunched in.  Steaks are aged and tender.  Salads fresh.  Side dishes are large and can be shared.  You don't feel like you are in a casino when you are here.. I went with my family for lunch, and was not disappointed. We had the meatballs for an appetizer. They were delicious and the sauce was so tasty.  All the food was made very well and the restaurant is very nicely decorated. I loved the dessert, so much better here than across the ways at Carlo's Bakery.  Service was great too.. I LOVE CBTL!!!!!

In my opinion, CBTL (particularly this location across from the UNLV campus) is superior to Starbucks. I frequent this location to study if I want to get out of the library. It is less crowded than Starbucks and there is a lot more space and more available tables. 

Also, their WiFi is faster than Starbucks, their coffee/tea is cheaper (and generally tastier) and they have newly available FREE charging stations for all kinds of phones, including chargers that are already plugged in.  Need a free charge? Stop by. Last night, they had chargers for iPhones, iPhone 5, Blackberry and one other that I didn't recognize. Also, they have a lot of power outlets!

CBTL is always clean their staff have always been very friendly. Although I can't speak for their coffee (I've just never ordered it), they have THE BEST selection of tea. Particularly, their English breakfast tea is delicious and tastes just like home.. My friend bought me a Straw-Bama for my 21st, and the chick was so friendly! :D It was tasty, couldn't even taste the alcohol!

Definitely buying again from there!. We had dinner here and breakfast the next morning as well. The dinner was absolutely amazing - fresh unique ingredients and expert service. I cannot express how delicious that steak was - Thank you so much for a truly memorable meal. Breakfast the next morning at the buffet was also quite good. You cannot walk away from this place hungry, that's for sure. Breakfast or dinner - YUMMMY!. The food at Olive Garden is always so amazing! Our Server Stan Lee Farley provided excellent customer service. He was very attentive and recommended a great appetizer. I will definitely be visiting Olive Garden again!. I understand why this is consistently ranked among the best buffets in Vegas.  What a selection!  Everything I tried, with the exception of some weird chocolate pie thing at the dessert bar, was fantastic!  The pork egg rolls may be the best I've ever had.  The homemade gelato?  Oh so good!  I tried various pastas, chicken parm, fried rice, mashed potatoes, fresh carved kielbasa and ham, veggies, etc.  I had been to the Rio buffet once before but it is better than I remember!  Would definitely go again!. So...who knew a swanky spot was hiding in an office complex? They have a delicious vegan dish & off the chain cocktails. Pricey- but you got a couple extra dollars, right?. Yes! If you see one show in Vegas Absinthe has to be it! We went with a group of 9 people and tried to order tickets two weeks in advanced for the VIP row. They didn't have enough in that area so we went for the reserved section which was about $50 less per person. I really wouldn't waste the money on VIP, we were on the sixth row and could see everything. The venue is very small and runs in a circle there is not front and every seat has a clear view of the stage. Most the acts take place up in the air so your looking up for most of the show.

This show is really only for a certain type of people. They are very raunchy. I saw a few people getting offended by Penny and her sock puppet act ;) Go in with a open mind and you will have a great time.. These people are terrific.  They were the 3rd repair company selected by Electrolux to service my Electrolux refrig/freezer.  They not only agreed it was defective, but contacted Electrolux; took possession of a new appliance and installed it.  There was no mess; no paperwork, and NO PROBLEMS.  I can't say anything except:  A+ SERVICE. Dolce is one of our favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Consistently good Italian.  My favorite dish is the Amatriciana and the limoncello cake is to die for.  However, we were a little disappointed on our last trip.  We went with another couple. We had a Living Social Deal & they had a groupon.  We asked if we could be treated as 2 separate tables since we were going to have 2 different bills and that way we could both use or vouchers.  I completely understand the reason why you would want to limit the number of vouchers used, but if we are acting/paying/ordering as 2 separate tables I don't understand why they wouldn't let us use both.  As I mentioned, Dolce is one of our favorite restaurants and we've been there many times. It would have been nice if they had been a little flexible (perhaps saying they would allow it this once and wouldn't allow it again).  But they didn't and it made me feel like they don't value loyal customers.. The cocktails are really out of this world, totally deserving of their reputation- try "Gavin's Braveheart" or the pumpkin pie special. In the warmer months they have outdoor seating with a view of the Capital, very charming. Worth a trip (or 10!). Decided to venture into a new Pittsburgh neighborhood on this lovely Sunday. Ended up in Mt. Washington, a great little hood and home of Shiloh Grill. Had a Po' boy crab sandwich that was delicious. Friendly staff and cool vibe in a cool neck of the woods.. Monday through Thursday 35 cent wings, but there's a catch. You have to buy a drink (I got a 2.50 pop) and 10 wings of one flavor (3.50). Which was fair, but I wish I could've gotten 5 wings in one flavor and 5 in another because it all looked so good! 

We got Spicy Thai, Hot, and Cajun, and I can attest that all of them were fried and slathered to perfection.  Not those dinky wings that other places try and pass off, but real big, juicy, and fried wings.. My new place for tailoring in Scottsdale! If you are looking for a professional tailor with great attention to detail, excellent customer service and very reasonable pricing you will find it with Irena at her new shop, Golden Thread. With years of experience in alterations at Nordstrom, Irena is extremely capable.  Her bright and airy shop, conveniently located in the TJMaxx shopping center off Miller and Camelback  offers ample parking and easy access.  However, it is Irena's warm and caring personality combined with expert tailoring skills that make her shop first class.. Heard about this place from a friend, and it's the best Italian food I've had!

The place is very small, only 6 tables. The owner (I think) greeted us right when we walked in, and the place was busy with guests dining in and picking up for takeout.  The decor is nice and clean, you can tell attention to detail is important to the owner. They have a server come to your table rather than order at the counter and sit down. Hunter was our server, very attentive and knowledgeable (thanks!)

Let's get to the food, everything is fresh here. The pasta & sauces are made in house, and delicious! Portions are filling, there's enough to take some home.  The rigatoni with pesto & gorgonzola was flavorful. The cioppino over fettuccine was my favorite, a seafood medley of deliciousness! My only gripe: the snow crab comes with shell, so be ready to get a little dirty :)

I'm so impressed, I wish I didn't live so far from this place. But the drive is definitely worth it, I'll be coming back!. I really liked this show. I guess mostly because it took me back to seeing my cousins and friend busitng those moves back in the day. My daughter also really enjoyed it..Theater did seem a lot smaller then most shows in Vegas but overall you were able to see the show pretty comfortable.  I wouldn't mind seeing them again. :-). Very efficient DMV office and mostly friendly staff. The supervisor (Tiffany) who dealt with me was extremely professional and efficient. If there are lines at this office, they move fast. Highly recommend a visit here!!. Home of the quirky, and unusual candies, we stepped into Smeeks as we were browsing through the Union section of the Biltmore.  The space is small, but they can pack in a lot of sweets in this store, as well as novelty items.  Hard, soft, chewy, candies, international sweets (Including British chocolates), in all shapes and sizes are here.  There is a wall of magnets on one of the walls where you can snicker at some of the funny and cute designs.  My friend couldn't resist and got a "Pooquito" magnet for her sister.  They also have salt water taffy, sold individually or in bulk.. Great service and good choices!  The veggie omelet was yummy. Next time I'll be decadent and try the Cinnamon Bun French Toast.. A hidden gem inside of Circus Circus.  I've had better steaks, but the atmosphere can't be beat!  The bread basket and black bean soup are both delicious, as are the mashed potatoes.. This place is perfect if you want to get the excitement of Vegas w/o the craziness.  This place is far enough from the strip that the madness there doesn't follow so the stay here actually feels like a vacation.
 
-Plan your day wisely around the shuttle bus schedule (unless if you rent a car)
-Play bingo every night and bring your lucky color stampers.
-Relax in the quiet pool, drink cocktail and remember your sun screen. 
-Gamble on the penny slots, go to nickels if you're feeling lucky. (the locals choose to play here for a reason!). Absolutely top doc, that is what Dr. Ebner is.  Went with a growth on the inside corner of my eye.  Dr. Ebner knew immediately that it was a cyst.  He took care of it on the spot.  He was so pleasant as was all the staff at AZ Dermatology.  I just can't say enough good things about them, professional, welcoming and very friendly.  My husband was with me and he made an appointment on before we left.  So happy with this business. The food was amazing... Shrimp and onion rings are a must and the fish fry was awesome!  I will be coming back!. What to do when some of the family wants chocolate, others caramel and still others pumpkin spice for our sugar fix for the week?   Caketini!
Quick in and out service after a busy day (week).  Friendly, competent staff.  Yummy cup cakes with enough variety for everyone.  
Despite being in crowded, limited parking San Tan Mall, this little shop is on the north side with great parking and easy access.. For a restaurant that received a Michelin star rating, I love that it's so casual. The bf took me here for lunch and although it's a lot more expensive than you would normally pay for lunch, it was very yummy :)

Decor: 4
Service: 5
Food: 4.5

It's located inside Caesars and it's pretty hard to miss since the sign is so big. The decor is cute, a little outdoorsy and casual. Our server was extremely helpful and friendly. He let us know which were more popular and wasn't afraid to tell us which items he didn't like either. Usually, servers just try to sell everything to you so I like that he was honest with us. Overall, the service was great. They always kept our glasses full and we never had to search for them because they just always happened to be there when we needed them haha

We decided to use their fixed menu and chose items off that list. For appetizers we ordered something Blue Pancake and Salmon & Tuna tartar. Personally, I liked the tar tar better than the pancake but my bf loved the pancake more than the tartar. The tartar itself is great but the chips that come with it are someewhat of a fail lol. For entrees we ordered sea scallops and their salmon entree. Both were DELICIOUS. The salmon was cooked realllllly well and the scallops came with avacado, chips, etc. Basically, both were the highlights of the meal, hands down. Lastly, we shared the Vanilla Profiteroles for dessert. I don't know what profiteroles are but it basically looks like a fancy icecream-filled puff to me. Haha either way, it was pretty good and a nice way to finish the meal. I think our meal cost an upward of $80, pretty pricey for lunch but I still thought it was pretty damn good. The Michelin star is well-deserved.. What a lovely place to grab a leisurely, hearty breakfast or brunch. While yes the place is technically a diner, it's really the only one I've ever seen that could be said to offer some historical interest as well; as the back of the menu describes in detail, the place used to be the home of the Courier Newspaper. Much of the decor hanging on the walls has some historical significance, which was so cool! Perfect place to bring an out-of-towner.

The food was really delicious. I ordered a Spanish omelette, which was HUGE and came with potatoes and a choice of homemade bread (I chose sourdough bread). The potatoes came diced, and were fried slightly soft--almost like very very tender McDonalds hashbrowns. Not my preferred breakfast potato style, but I'll take it!! The omelette was my favorite part--stuffed with fresh jalapenos, onions, chorizo, and Chihuaha cheese. And so cheap, too! 8-ish bucks for a very generous meal.

But the best part of the meal: the truly great service (particularly in contrast to the brunch experience I had had just the day before elsewhere, in Champaign). I don't remember her name, but our waitress just beamed amiable Midwest charm, and was very competent about getting us refills and keeping us apprised of the status of our dishes when there was a bit of a wait to get our food. My friend who brought us to this place has stories of how this same waitress would bring her hot tea with lemon when she was feeling ill.

I believe it. And I'd gladly come back next time.. All the instructors are very knowledgeable and super friendly! I'm so glad I chose this school, they have made a great impression of what Realtors are supposed to be. Everyone is very professional and have great energy! This school really made learning fun!! Thank you Arizona Academy of Real Estate for making me really feel like my career move is the right one!!!. My favorite bakery! I love french macarons and usually get some everywhere I go, where available. The french macarons here are exceptionally good! The pistachio macarons are my favorite. Yum!. **Disclaimer: Haven't been in this store, just had a cupcake.**

Last summer when Missy F. was staying with my Dude and I for a while, she popped into Mind Over Batter and brought us both a cupcake as her way of saying, "THANKS, Y'ALL!"

What a delicious cupcake! Extra moist (lawl, moist) cake and just the right amount of coconut.

I would totally stop in and pay $3 to have one of these babies again!. Two words: prime rib.. Very fun bar, great service. Perfect alternative for youthful & aging rockers looking for somewhere to go & something to do off the strip & away from the typical Vegas madness. Great service.. Currently my favorite fajita spot. I love me some fajitas and this place knows exactly how to serve them up. While you're waiting for your food you are given chips, salsa, AND bean dip. Yum! The fajitas come out table-side, as the waiter creates a flame on them, before handing them off to you. Dinner and a mini show! The margaritas are my favorite there as well!. Tried for the first time and loved it. Spicy crab roll & shrimp tempura were delicious. Tried the ramen and it wasn't very good. Very bland and too much going on. We also had the miso cod appetizer, very delicious.. I love Kyong!! She is so knowledgeable about skincare. I've lived in Vegas for almost two years now and have noticed a change in my skin. Luckily, I met Kyong. My skin's appearance is so much brighter. Not only is Kyong very knowledgeable, she also provides the best customer service. Her professionalism and expertise will keep you coming back for more. 

Thanks, Kyong. For best service and closing a great deal, Trent Jenkins is the guy! My best friend and I went in  for the purchase of her first BMW and the experience was great. He got her a good deal, was honest and upfront about everything.. I love the Arizona Canal!! My favorite thing about Arizona (besides Eric M.) is the outdoor workouts that are available, mainly because I am an active person but I can't stand gyms. Along with hiking Camelback/Piewesta Peak and running Tempe Town Lake, running or biking the canal is one of my favorite fun and free workouts that we do around town. When the weather is hot, the water from the canal provides some relief. The city has been great by providing lighting for the pathways and I feel extremely safe whether we're riding/running during the day or after dark. The canal can lead to a number of places but I love heading to O.H.S.O. They have bike parking right off the canal or if you're walking your dog, they welcome your four-legged friends onto the patio area where they supply free water and treats (plus they have amazing food and beer). We have biked from our part of town by Arcadia to Mill Ave and Old Town Scottsdale a bunch.. Great way to get around without having to pay for parking!. I work for Copper State Home Builders & we use Camelback Moving for our clients. Never one complaint. One of our best vendors!. We have ordered from here a few times now.  The food has been consistently good and the delivery service very fast.  The sweet & sour pork was really tasty.  My spouse loved the Pad Thai Spicy Noodle.  They paid attention to the notes I added to my order and were happy to change the Pad Thai to be vegetarian, no problem.  Always a great experience with China Tango, our new go-to Chinese food restaurant!. This was a great show!! Very entertaining and super funny. Not to mention they are fantastic singers. The new addition valentine is an amazing singer!! I never saw the original show with the sister but man the Valentine girl has amazing vocals! I would definitely see this again and again.. My bf and I came on a Tuesday night. We were given a brief informational lesson about how to paint the clay pieces by an employee. 

However, we were told that drawing with pencil and permanent marker was fine because they would burn off, which turned out to be wrong. Also, we were told to leave the price sticker on our clay pieces.
My final mug was dark, so any pencil marks, if there was any, was unnoticeable. My bf's dish had very apparent pencil marks - even when he had painted and repainted the dish white so many times I bet he had added another inch to the dish's diameter. 

Overall, we had a great time during the painting process (the place was clean and there were many cool clay pieces) but the final product (due to poor and incorrect instructions) left us greatly disappointed.

We were compensated with two free studio passes.. Just had an excellent experience with Jerry! On time AND solved our problem in one shot when it took 4 previous companies to fix our Trane AC. Would def recommend to anyone with confidence!. Great service- good food- nice to have healthy breakfast options. 
Our waiter was very accommodating and patient with our 3 kids.. I always enjoy going here, the coffee is always great and the owner is super nice.  I always stay a little longer and chit chat with her.  In a big city,  its the people who work in small cafes like this that keep me coming back.  I love seeing the same face!. We went for the opening game yesterday and for the Girl Scout night.  First, there were only 2 bad parts to this ballgame. 1: I found that parking is not free, its $4.00 and the smallest bill they take is a 20 and you have to pay cash. 2: Traffic is ridiculous. You would think Metro woud have better crowd control.  We sat on the off ramp of the 95 to Las Vegas Blvd for 35 minutes just trying to turn right, so be prepared to remain calm and watch for people turning right from the lane next to you, pushing your car off the road or just trying to ram into your car.  The food prices seemed ok. Hotdog (Hebrew National I think) was really good, it was 4.00 but we had planned on going back up to get mustard on it after we dropped the drinks off at our seats, but it was so crowded we ate it plain.  The best soda deal was the souviener cup for 5 bucks. Peanuts were 4.00 and my daughter says they had the best grilled cheese (which I think was 4 or 5 bucks).  What I didn't know was that you can bring your own food into the park.  Also, there are lots of opportunities to catch a foul ball so be sure to bring your glove.  One guy was lucky to have bought popcorn cuz thats where one foul ball landed.  There was a great fireworks show at the end.  Overall, I would say it was pretty cool and fun for a good family night out.. Success! BCBG is the go-to place for party dresses, no doubt about it.  The BCBG at Kierland is quite large...not quite the largest I have been in, but much larger than the one at BCBG. The store is neatly organized and easy to move around.  The party dress and more formal dress section is in the back and it is a bit cramped, so when a few people get back there groing through the racks, it's not super enjoyable.  The sales associate, Crystal, who helped me today was very nice.  I found a dress I really liked but needed a smaller size which was not on the racks.  I asked her if they had the smaller size in the back and she was happy to check for me.  Luckily they did have the size I needed and I walked away with a super fab party dress for Vegas.  The shoe and purse section is probably the largest of any BCBG I have been in.  The best thing about BCBG is that they run sales quite frequently, especially at the end of the season and you can find items up to 70% off.  I found quite a few casual dresses and tops while I was there that I am hoping to go back for in the near future.

If you are in the market for a cute dress or a party dress, make the BCBG at Kierland a stop. You will not be disappointed.. I think if I would give any points off for this place it would be for price..... But I didn't bc they aren't far off from Starbucks and the quality is heads and shoulders above them. 
I tend to stick to iced coffee mainly. Their iced coffee is pretty superior! 
The French macaroons are literally the size if your palm... Aren't the best but certainly not the worst either. Their sandwiches are clever and delicious and all the various blended drink options are to die..... Red velvet and monkey mocha?! Come on!
I'm a self admitted coffee snob and this place really hits the mark. Anytime you can have a coffee joint open 24 hrs is a win win in my book!. I was introduced to Retro Bakery many years ago.  Since that time, their cupcakes have become a staple at any birthday gathering, family event, or anything really!  I love introducing newbies to the excitement of Retro Bakery.  Their flavor combinations are creative, fun and not to mention the most delicious in town!  I have tried other cupcake places in the Las Vegas valley and Retro wins by a buttercream landslide!!!. Woodlands always comes through for vegetarian Indian.  Even for the biggest lover of meat , vegetarian Indian is the best.  It is so good and spicy you don't even miss your favorite meat products.  If you haven't tried Indian food, I like to order a lot and eat family style.  So if it is a first visit bring a couple of people with you, so you can order more food. 

The menu is daunting at first glance, if you aren't familiar with Indian food, some of my favorites are the okra and tomatoes, chickpeas in tomato sauce, cheese in tomato sauce, eggplant - there are always plenty of lentil dishes.  Once when you get the Indian words down, you find your favorites fast.  Don't forget to order bread.  It is the most important part for dipping!  If you like it spicy- remember to tell them, because it is so much better spicy.  I might suggest ordering everything medium and one dish spicy, so then you can see what your comfort level is.  

Woodlands is not much to look at - this restaurant is begging for a makeover, it could be so cute, but it is so broke down.  In fact, I prefer  take away rather than dining in.  If you judge restaurants by their restrooms, don't even go in.  

Woodlands has awesome food.. It's all about the Cosmo! My two hotspots i had to visit were at the Cosmopolitan. Wicked Spoon Buffet and The Pizzaria. Walking through this hotel to get to these places were alot of fun. Random things all over the place. Maybe not those bunnies on the commercials, but shoes in the middle of nowhere, cool cigarette dispenser looking things offering artwork. Sparkly stuff. I loved walking through this place and hope to one day stay here and party at the Marquee.. After all the massive junk I ate the previous day (buffets), I was craving some good ol' not fattening and healthy Korean food that would alleviate my stomach.

As we were driving around the "Chinatown area," we saw Mother's Korean Grill, so we decided to eat there.. and I'm glad I did.

Right when I walked in, I was impressed because I didn't expect it to be too nice, since it was Vegas anyway. The interior was very modern and sleek, and the place was huge! The restaurant is divided into bbq grillers and non bbq grillers.

We ordered the Kimchee Soft Tofu Soup and the Kimchee Dolsot Bibimbap (mixed rice, vegetables, beef, hot sauce in a stone pot) and both were pretty good. The soft tofu soup was ok but the kimchee dolsot bibimbap was very unique. I've never had anything like it and I'm from Southern CA for goodness sakes! 

The servers were nice and accomodating, the place was really clean, and overall, I had a good experience there. The prices were higher than in SoCal but that's because there aren't many Korean restaurants in Vegas - duh.

The boba place right next to Mother's Korean Grill is realllly good too.. Korean food + boba = happy happy me.. I was originally drawn to this place because of convenience , and the fact that I'd much rather support a local, independently owned business. I only frequented Starbucks because I truly LIKED  their coffee, but I don't usually support any corporate businesses. I was so pleasantly surprised by this place! They've done a fantastic job of making it homey, warm and inviting. It's updated and cozy without being at all pretentious. Their coffee is nothing short of amazing. Strong and flavorful, but only because that's what I LIKE. The staff is so attentive that I only had to order once before the dark, longer haired gentleman ( sorry his name escapes me right now, which is awful because he always waits on me and is so friendly) had my preferences memorized. It's worth it to ask about their menu because they'll make whatever you like, however you like it. As a vegan, I was also so impressed to know they  offer many organic, all natural selections as well. I love that they serve fresh pressed juices,too. This is popular in other states because of the health benefits, but not so much in the burgh. They're perfectly sized and convenient and are a great natural substitute to coffee. Juices can provide more energy than caffeine, and I'm glad they realize that. I really have nothing negative to say, here! This establishment is clean, inviting, has fabulous employees, and offers great products all over the board. It's refreshing to leave an establishment with a smile on your face and eager to devour whatever delicious concoction they've made for you. Keep up the good work, Delanies. You'll continue to see me on a daily basis! And your staff ALL deserve gold stars.. Love this place. Coffee is good, service is fast and the fresh fruit crepes are delicious. They come with a large muffin and granola. Almost too much for one person.  Nice and bright inside the restaurant and seating outside as well.. I love everything about this quaint little corner wine bar........wish it had more room because it's always packed!. For 5 bucks it's so good! I can probably eat this pizza everyday. Its just that good! Also very nice workers. I suggest anybody wanting a cheap and very yummy pizza to stop by Arizona Authentic Pizza.. My husband and I love this place. We can't get enough of their tomatoes soup and their chicken Cesar pizza. The atmosphere is very relaxing. If you're in the area I would recommend this place.. Very happy and grateful for this place.  Back in December, we brought our Pomeranian in  because she was yelping out in pain.  The Dr. was able to asses her problem and treated her.  We followed up with our regular vet a couple of days later and all is well.

We did have to wait a little while here, as it was a Sunday before a major holiday, but was well worth the wait.. I just moved in, March 1st and I am enjoying the great amenities, gorgeous view and love my loft apt..I have ran into minor issues in the unit, but it's expected. Just because it's a new building, does not mean it's in perfect condition. For the price, there are things that could be better inside apt. But overall, I love it!!! Cool, Fun, energetic atmosphere with hip neighbors. It's a community, where people are actually enjoys the hip vibe of the place. I mean, that's why, you move in such a place.. I just checked out Hofbrauhaus for the first time and I must say.  Hofbrauhaus has made me question my newly single status. Bring on the weirdos in lederhosen!!

Always wanted to get to the Cincinnati location when I was living in Louisville, but never did.  We walked in around 9 p.m.  Early enough that it wasn't crazy, but late enough that the super majority had dos boots of beer and were schammered.  And we tried to catch up!  But those German girls are a lot more woman than me.  After one ginormous beer, I was done!  

Great touristy atmosphere.  Very interactive.  Most of the servers were very friendly.  A total drunken, German party -- dancing, singing and drinking.  I can't wait to go back and try the food because nothing says party time like beer and kraut! hehe.. Saw Bachi Burger on the Food Network so I really wanted to try it and overall very satisfied!! :)

Ordered:

Ronin Burger (Medium done): yummm, juicy and flavorful, the citrus aioli sauce made it very sweet

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: loved this!! Very flavorful and perfect amount of cheese, don't mix the whole thing though, gets soggy quick!

Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger (Medium Done): You can really taste the batter of the onion rings in this one! Flavors are a good mixture and do not overpower .. tasty!

Service is great, but then again I went at 11AM when they just opened :P, plenty of parking available.. The best 'cool' place in Snottsdale!!! Kind of a dive bar but still totally popular. I just miss the ping-pong table. They must have ditched that for more table and bar space, which I guess is understandable but still. Anyway I love going there whenever. AND... it's one of the few Scottsdale places that serves (consistently) generous mixed drinks, if you know what I mean!!!!! And it never fails that I bump into great friends!. When you walk into this place it reminds me of the movie Good Fellas. My brother turned me onto this place and it is fantastic. Family owned and operated. Just the nicest group of people. And the food, although not all heart smart from what I could see at our table, was quite delish!. I love Olive Garden! This place is usually pretty good. The last time I ate there we sat in the bar and the service was great. We got plenty of attention from our server even thought it was very busy. Our food showed up on time and was exactly what we ordered.. This store is a lot of fun to shop for plants in.  They seem to have a nice variety and friendly employees.  Also, the store was not too busy or loud.  Enjoyable way to spend a Saturday morning.. Seriously,best sushi in Pittsburgh. Freshest ingredients, huge portions and very reasonable pricing. And yeah, Andy gives free samples if you smile at him!. Love this place and the location always great food and I have never had a complaint!. This is my 4th time here in four weeks. I try something new and everything I've tried have been winners! Plus they're really friendly.. We came here during Las Vegas' Restaurant Week sometime in 2010. Yes, I'm a bit late writing this review, but better late then never! 

The Restaurant Week menu is different from the regular menu and we ordered: 
- La Tomate (Chilled tomato gazpacho with croutons)
- Le Crabe (King crab fritter with spiced guacamole)
- Le Veau (Veal piccata served with arugula salad)
- La Chartreuse (Green chartreuse soufflé, pistachio ice cream)

(Good thing I found the menu online, because I was blanking on the names and had NO idea how to describe what I ate. All I could think of was "yummy", "mmm" and random descriptions like "that crab thingy").

$50.10 for a Joel Robuchon restaurant is not bad at all. Considering that the tasting menu is about $155, this is a nice little taste. If you don't like it, then whatever. At least you got to try a Joel Robuchon restaurant at a cheap price. If you like it, awesome! You can come back and get the tasting menu. 

There wasn't much creativity with the dishes we ate, but maybe that's because we ordered the Restaurant Week menu. All the other non-Restaurant Week diners' foods looked yummy and more creative. BUT I definitely enjoyed the food. I felt that some of the items were a tad salty by itself, but if you eat it together with the other items on the dish, it works very well. I mean, you ARE supposed to get a bite of everything on the dish. That's what makes it so yummy. It's kind of like what Remy, from Ratatouille said about the cheese and strawberry combination. By itself it's great, but when you eat it together, it's like a burst of flavors! 

The most memorable part of the meal was the mashed potato. I know, you're probably thinking it's JUST mashed potatoes, but OHHH these were not any ordinary mashed potatoes. Most mashed potatoes just hit you with that buttery flavor right away, BUT with these, you can enjoy the texture, and then slowwwwwly you can taste the butter. It turns out they don't use normal butter, but they use expensive French butter, which gives it that not so overwhelming butter flavor. If I could, I'd use it on everything. I'd probably sit it in bed and eat sticks of it.

We definitely plan on coming back on a normal night to try the tasting menu. But if you don't want to splurge on a meal or just want to give this place a try, I recommend coming here during Restaurant Week:  http://www.threesquare.org/events/event-calendar/restaurant-week/. Great happy hour!! All of the bartenders are really friendly and personable. One of the bartenders made us some amazing shots! Clean, fun atmosphere. Great for hanging out with friends or a date night.. I have to admit that I was a little nervous after reading all of the negative reviews. I decided to give it a shot. My family of 4 went to celebrate a birthday. I didn't tell them any of the negative because I wanted their honest reaction since I'm the only  one of the four of us who's not such a meat lover. 
Between the four of us, we tried every meat that was brought to our table. The only disappointment (only for me) was that we were never served filet mignon. Every meat brought to the table was consumed by one of us. Not a scrape left on anyone's plate. The seasoning was perfect. My kids even tried the lamb!
We went on a Thursday at 6:30PM so the place was never full but they kept a steady stream of meat coming out. The adults were done and full long before the kids. The entire staff was SOOO friendly! 
I had purchased a living social offer so I feel the value was decent. We were celebrating a birthday so this was a splurge for us. The "salad" bar is not that big but my boyfriend loved the antipasto portion. I happen to love Barefoot wine so I was very satisfied with our bottle of Moscato. For a special occasion and with another special offer, I would definitely consider returning here.. I can't believe anyone is complaining about this place. I have lived here for 12 years and I can say this was a great buffet, I thought the price, service, and food were great for a buffet. I originally thought it was stupid to have a buffet right down the street from boulder station, Arizona Charlie's , etc... But it actually made sense to me today, I went there with a friend for lunch today and it was great, I didn't have to walllkkkkk thru a huge casino to have my 1/2 lunch, it was great we got there at 11:50 and thankfully there was no line, when we were leaving yes there was a line about 15 people. But it was great I would recommend to everybody. Only downside is I don't cook with salt and it seemed like the Asian food was really salty, it might just be me. And FYI the restrooms were super clean.. This place is delicious!  When in Vegas you must try this place.  Very friendly staff.. Pretty damn good.  Drove by and saw this place so decided to try it out. 
 Prices are reasonable and offered traditional Mediterranean meals that tasted amazing.  

this should expand and overtake the larger chains that are crap.  The food did take a while to come out but there was about 8 people in line in front and considering the small operation and made to order food, I understand.. I enjoyed lunch here today with a colleague for the first time. The beet salad with basil pesto, arugula, goat cheese, toasted pistachios and fig vincotto was fantastic. You can't go wrong with beets and goat cheese as far as I'm concerned. We also shared the Polipo which is braised mediterranean octopus, arugula, piquillo peppers, taggiasca with mint vinaigrette and last but not least the Semolina gnocchi, with italian sausage, pine nuts and ricotta salata which was soo good.  I can't wait to go back and try the two styles of pizza they offer and are actually known for. Brad B was our server, Service was great, attentive but not intrusive.. Awesome Italian food! One of my Scottsdale favorites, Tommy V's has a great staff, wine list and consistently delicious food. Love the new fried Burrata and the calamari is a must. They also have a good happy hour menu with small plates to share. They do live music on the weekends- great spot for a date or night out with friends!. Our waiter, Georgio was amazing, he made our experience soooo memorable and made some incredible Menu recommendations.  Our entrees were great, wines selection was extensive.  Xoxo. The best drycleaners in town!!  I moved to Phoenix about a year and a half ago, and went through 5 other drycleaners before finding this little gem.  Arcadia Dry Cleaners is located just north of Campbell on 40th Street, which is really convenient for my drive to/from work.  

I usually show up with over 20 items, and once I brought a white linen jacket that had yellow-ed on the sleeve from age.  When I came to pick up my order, everything was ready except the jacket.  I was amazed at their persistence to keep working until they cleaned the jacket, at no extra cost to me...and now it looks new again!  Seems trivial, but I was just really impressed with their service, especially after trying so many in the Arcadia area.. Atmosphere is cozy, coffee is great, service is friendly. If you haven't been here it's a must try.. Great place to meet a friend for coffee, have a work meeting/lunch or place a catering order and take it back to the office. 

Terrific coffee, great food and awesome concept. The profits go to feed hungry kids...turning hunger into hope.. Fabulous service....and great atmosphere. Will come back again...and again.. Bit surreal when you stumble into a book shop and find an epic tale about a steampunk cat, destined to take over a futuristic realm.

But this is what Transreal specialises in - science fiction and fantasy books. From Tolkien's hobbits to Iain M Banks, it's got a much more extensive sci fi collection than you're likely to find in high street book stores.

There's a big steampunk section, new releases and Terry Pratchett old school stuff. There are enormous book series displayed orderly and concisely, and a small collection of figurines. There's also a small number of cute wee cuddly toys that would come under the strange and bizarre category.

The owner seems to handpick stuff he likes, but at least you know then that he is passionate and knowledgable about his stock. He was laid back and approachable.

I didn't realise it was a sci fi shop so I was a bit surprised when I came across the book about the cat astronaut. But this shop also had popularised TV series such as Doctor Who, Star Trek and some surprises such as cinematography collections. I'd probably three star it for myself since sci fi isn't one of my burning passions, but I'm four starring it since it has its merits, and people into the genre would find it useful.. Truly an experience! We won't give detailed descriptions of the menu items since the previous reviewers did such an excellent job but we will expound on the superb & attentive, knowledgeable and entertaining service! The sommelier, Darius, chose the perfect Champagne selection for us, it is very obvious that their number 1 reason for being there is to make sure you're have a "dining" experience, which we did. Giada was present and stopped by to find out what we thought of her new endeavor, that was just an added bonus. Locals & visitors alike, don't miss Giada's, it's perfecto!. Our visit was 100% free.. Each of us has a myVEGAS Facebook account.  We saved up loyalty points,  it was worth it completely.  If you go through myVEGAS you must call ahead. They want you to be at the box office 4 hours in advance so they can sell the rest.  Tell them what date, any food allergies should be mentioned to note it on your account.

I had the gluten free meal. Yeah the Chicken was dry,  yes the meal was on the Boring side. I had no season on my chicken, it was still great to eat healthy & snack out.  I had a plate of fruits for dessert (grapes were all I really liked).

The show being free was the best part. They get interactive with the audience. We were seated in the dragon section (the evil doers section). We rooted for the bad guys,  definitely a great family friendly show.  

WARNING: NOT recommended for people with a weak heart ( multiple loud explosions) or people with Epilepsy (they have lights flashing in your face from the show & pictures being taken).  It's cramped, buy tickets for your kids you're not going to want them in your lap for hours.. Cheap prices, speedy and friendly service and fun atmosphere. 

Great for big groups and lots of private areas to sit and chat. The outside area near the firepits is my favorite, minus the gross smokers. Blah I'm a huge fan of a drink menu where the prices are well under $10. Kind of hard to find in a town like this.The food portions are enormous and also well-priced. Fantastic. 

I'll be back.. I had lunch here the other day and it was so good we went back for dinner tonight. Dinner was even better! Service is top notch and the food was amazing. For lunch we had romaine salad with chorizo and homily croutons, shrimp tamale, and the best burger ever. For dinner we had salmon, chopped salad, incredible pork tenderloin and cauliflower gratin. Both times we sat at the bar and the service was great. Every time I travel to Vegas I go to Mesa Grill. Highly recommend.. Great service and an added bonus that they over to not only price match competitors, but to also beat the price by $5. Oh and the Yelp check-in freebie of a FREE tempered screen protector ($29.99 MSRP) is awesome. Thanks Daniel. It's a good happy hour after a long day at work to wait out the traffic mess. The bartenders are very friendly and the cocktails are delicious. Great selection of beer too. But my favorite thing about it is the old movies that play (with no sound) in the background. Nothing like watching a really bad japanese monster film and while enjoying a good drink.

Parking can be a mess depending on when you go. You can go in on 7th avenue side or up the fire escape staircase to get in. Either way, it's a cool bar with a good vibe.. One word, OMAKASE! Everything was amazing, excellent food and great service. One of my fav sushi spots in LV. Loved this place.  It was great to find this place off the strip.  Small not fancy place but everything about it is big.  Big flavors and big personality (our server was funny and just awesome).  The food was really good.  Try the broiled oysters.  My god, I just wanted to eat more and more. the entrees were good depending on what you ordered good beer and the desserts were awesome. Get the sweet potato pie.  This place is very casual.  Go if you want a no fuss restaurant with good Cajun food and great service.. Clean restaurant, good food seasoned well, large portions.  I am a fan! The beef bulgogi plate and the pork bulgogi plate are both very good and I recommend trying both of these meat plates.  If you spring for the fried rice, it is delicious!  I recommend giving this place a try for a good meal at a good price when you are in the mood for something casual yet adventurous.. After visiting 4 separate pharmacies, trying to get a prescription filled, I finally landed here. Vanessa the pharmacist turned out to be a godsend. My doctor had prescribed me a dose of pain meds that no longer exist after having surgery on my throat. Vanessa proceeded to spend the next 45 minutes on the phone trying to rectify the problem, and she succeeded. She has definitely made my night a whole lot better with her actions. I wish more people in the world were like her. She is amazing at her job and truly cares about the patients. CVS is definitely lucky to have an employee as awesome as she is.. Vangie is AMAZING. Seriously, she knows what she is doing and tells you whats not good for your hair and what is. Her coloring and cutting is always exactly what I want. She is quick, talented, professional and efficient. She is always booked, so make sure you book ahead of time!. This was my first Cirque du Soleil show and despite some negative reviews on Alegria  I had read on other sites,  I went with an open mind.  I was not in the least bit disappointed.  Sure, parts of the show were a little slower than others, but overall, I really enjoyed it.  

The live band and singers did an excellent job providing the perfect audio backdrop for the mezmerizing visuals of the tumblers/gymnasts, trapeze artists, and contortionists.  I was completely in awe of the physical feats that these people are capable of.  

These folks are ultimate professionals and executed  all of their tasks efficiently.  

I am not a big fan of clowns, but I thought that these were not too obnoxious. A couple of their skits ran a little long in my opinion, but I am sure the little ones in the audience enjoyed these bits. 

Overall, I found the show to be well balanced and very well done.  I look forward to my next Cirque du Soleil show!. Friendly, family owned. Great coffee, free wi-fi and punch card if you buy nine you get one free. Great if you drink a shitton of coffee like I do. Im a grab n go type of gal but there's a nice patio on the lake if you are that guy that hangs at coffee shops. Could use better artwork/decor inside though.
Update: of course the day after I posted this, the internet in my house goes out, so I head to the coffee rush to be "that guy" as I put so eloquently before, and finish some business with their wifi.
The owner was there, turns out they were closed for renovations, but he offers us free coffee and pulls a chair for us to sit on the patio. Very friendly, and apparently redecorating.. so I felt the need to add another star.
definitely a fan.. I love Deville Dinerbar! It's trendy and right in the heart of downtown Montreal and it isn't a tourist-y sham like so many others in the downtown core. I would be lying if I said it wasn't overpriced, but it's tasty and fun for afterwork 5 a 7. The finger food is delicious, fried pickles and mac and cheese egg rolls-- yes please!, even the entrees are great! I loveee the meatloaf!

The ambience is fun and there is a daily drink special that has inclined me more than once to try a new elixir.

If the service was better and the price was right it would be a 5 star, but that won't stop me from going back!. Burritos and the chips are amazingly awesome. Saw one customer that was complaining because the chef told him he could only accept cash at the moment and it was closed for a moment, the customer was also mad because his kids were hungry. To that customer, there are tons of places to elsewhere. If you were so concerned of your children being hungry, maybe take them somewhere else to eat instead of complaining and posting it on fb/yelp. Are you really that lazy to walk a block to find foods? Anyways, foods and service is awesome! Keep it up!!!. Came here with my old boyfriend about 5 years ago.  It was a memorable experience.  We were able to bring our own bottle of wine, which was an expensive Bourdeux, without being charged a corking fee.  We also used a Restaurant.com $75 gift certificate so out bill was very reasonable.  I still remember that meal like it was yesterday.  Our server was Ricardo.  Sadly I heard that he doesn't work there any more after a more recent visit.  I ordered the filet and we also had the truffled Mac and cheese.  Delicious.  They also have a bone-in filet that I've ordered on several separate occasions.  Get that if you can.  It's a filet with a little more fat and flavor and it melts in your mouth.  Yummy yummy yummy.  The service is always great.  I highly recommend this place.. Just finished breakfast! Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. 
The food was spot on. The service was prompt and friendly. The new location is roomy and not far from the strip. 

Best part... Mr. Mama stopped by and said hi to the table. As everyone ha said.... He's the nicest guy you'll ever meet. I wouldn't come back to Vegas and not come here. 

Definitely best breakfast in Las Vegas.. I am mortified of heights but my husband and our good friend convinced me to get on this thing. It was well worth it. It is the largest observation tower in the world. At its apex it reaches 550 feet. The whole trip takes about 30 minutes.  This isn't meant for someone who is in a hurry. The view was beautiful from up top and you could barely feel it moving.. I have been getting my signs ans whatever Scott can do for years! Since 1995. I highly recommend these guys. In fact, ordering again from them today! Thanks Scott!. We've been taking our daughter to see Dr. Alexander since she was four or so months old. For how busy this office is, we've never had a problem with scheduling, insurance, late night calls, etc. The waiting room is split into Sick and Well areas, and both are kept very clean. 

We've seen a handful of the doctors here, and each has handled my daughter extremely well. They've also handled my numerous questions and concerns wonderfully, taking their time to assure I understand, and never rushing through answers. Actually, on our last well visit, Dr. Alexander sat with us for a good 15 minutes discussing numerous topics before casually heading off to his next appointment. 

Overall this is a fantastic office, and I look forward to future years here (crossing my fingers for well visits only!).. Not sure where the hate is coming from. I stopped in for lunch to get a sandwich and charge my phone in between errands and shopping- the waitresses were super nice and friendly, chatted with me about what I bought at Ivy & Leo (apparently they love that boutique as much as I do), and gave me a tip to get the hand cut chips. I've been there twice now and gotten a reuben- which was delicious- both times. No complaints on the bread, the size, or the toppings. It's just a really solid reuben.

I did, however, talk to the new owner- she is also from Michigan and said she bought the place a while ago. I'm sure she is the reason Phil's is turning around! Since I am new to Charlotte I have only experienced the really, really delicious reubens. No complaints here!. Just came over for HH on the patio.  First off the service was awesome.  My favorite of the four appetizers I ordered was the homemade burrata.  The prime burger is very filling and a popular choice for the night, at least one person from every table ordered one.  The calamari was soft and sweet but I think crispier may have been better.  The carpaccio was good but not as savory just creamier.   Regardless the red blend was a great pairing for the above appetizers.. The first time my boyfriend and I ever went to Lo-Lo's was in April of last year. And back then, it was just a house with a modestly sized dining area. It was a bit of a hole in a wall, but the food and service was far from disappointing. :) We went again not too long ago, and they upgraded to a larger building. Of course, the food was still amazing. The koolaid and lemonade is a bit too sweet, even for my taste (which is saying something, because I LOVE sweets), but still good. Oh, but the food. OGAD,THE FOOD.

So good.
SO GOOD.
If you haven't tried Lo-Lo's yet THEN YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW GOOD THEY ARE.. I've been a client of Jason Pistiner for 4 years. He helped me obtain guardianship for my grandmother who developed Alzheimer's. My family has acquired lawyers for many noncriminal situations for years and by far I have to say that Jason has been one of the most comprehensive, detail oriented and practical lawyers I've ever worked with! He's patient and will answer any questions he possibly can and as honestly as he possibly can and keep you updated on your case without you having to chase him down. His prices are reasonable and if he doesn't have experience with something he will tell you that this is not his field of expertise and will direct you to someone who might be able to help you. If your case requires a lot of paperwork, he will fill out as much as he possibly can and might even ask you the questions needed to fill out your side of things if that is what you want. You can't get any better than Jason!

As for Robert Singer, let me say this. The woman who left her review below  (Helen) specifically stated that Robert Singer  will bully you if you are underrepresented. I've not worked with him but I do know that a lawyer's job is to represent their client by any means necessary. It is the court's job to decide whether or not the lawyer is acting within legal bounds and arrive at a decision. By Helen complaining about someone being unrepresented then all that says is that SHE was the one that was unrepresented and she was upset because she lost against Singer. That might mean that Singer is also good at his job. Just sayin'.. It is what you think it is. Craps game is nice though, friendly dealers. One or two need to brush up on how to properly payout bets though....you know who you are.. I loved Paz Cantina, after two businesses not working out at that location, I feel this one will be there for long! 3 things I loved: the tacos, the street corn and the ambience! My bf and I had a really good time and we will definitely come again! I would give 5 stars, but our waitress forgot our drinks and she took a little long! You must try :). $48 hamburger... 

I must seem like an idiot...but this hamburger was THE ORIGINAL NY DB BURGER (9-oz. sirloin burger stuffed with braised short ribs, foie gras, black truffle, parmesan bun) served with french fries. I actually got the prix fixe menu for $48. It comes with a few choices, but I got the caesar salad (heart of romaine, avocado, parmesan), the burger and for dessert the warm pear clafoutis (spiced orange marmalade, almond ice cream). Although it was a nice meal, I don't know if I'd be dying to go back to eat the burger. It was really good for the first 2 or 3 bites but after that the foie gras and truffles were too overpowering. It was as if the foie gras and truffles were fighting for power in my mouth. 

The service was good. The water show on the lake was really weird with ugly images being displayed every hour. It's a fancy schmancy restaurant with good and expensive food. 

Here's their menu:
http://www.danielnyc.com/dbbrasserie/_pdf/menu.pdf. I love Bashas donuts and Friday is buy a dozen get 6 free.  Now in my office we do not need 18 donuts, there is only 2 of us...but I love their custard filled aka Boston Creme donuts..Yum Yum...and they are sooo good.

Let face it, who wants a donut with a little creme filling? Well you do not have to worry about getting only a little dollop.  These donut will not leave you disappointed!. I've only been here 3 times, but lthe night of the Gavin Degraw concert (love him! hehe ;) ) was my first time at the pool area. 

It was freakin' gorgeous and not crowded w/ drunktards! (excuse my language, but you know that's true with pools on The Strip) I'm a local and I appreciate that it looked like a pool resort at the strip without being on The Strip, AND.... w/ out obnoxiously drunk tourist. There's one huge round pool, a couple smaller ones and jacuzzis near the concert stage area, a bar called the Sandbar with gambling tables. No long lines or long wait to get in to the bathrooms. 

There's a huge grass/lawn whatever you wanna call it in front of the concert stage. which is nice. they have lounge chairs around the main pool, and they're pretty nice too and not like the regular white ones you see at every pool. It gives an 'island' relaxing feel to the pool area. Some are in the water so u can dip ur feet in. Fun fun. Perfect for Vegas summers. 

Anyways, this was my first time at one of the summer Revolution concerts at Red Rock. It rocked!!! (hehe small lame joke)

As for the rest of the casino, it's new (a few yrs old) so it's gorgeous. I've been to the buffet (it's decent), it's not crowded but  the last time I was there was 2-3 yrs ago. I'm out of "the clubbing phase." I've been to Cherry and the other lounge, I forgot what it's called, they're okay seems a better fit for the older crowd since I went with my aunties and uncles. Lol I know right?! Wth? But they like to get down too. Hehe.

 I'd say the best part of this resort is the pool. I should have took more pics of the pool so I could post it up but I was too busy enjoying myself at the free Gavin Degraw concert! 

If it wasn't for Gavin Degraw being here, I would never be at this resort. I doubt he'll see this but I LOVE you Gavin! :)

I'm looking forward to the rest of the concerts lined up for the summer at this pool. 

The one con for me again is the distance, coming from east Henderson. but I'm the type that wouldn't mind traveling far for great quality and a funtastic experience!

Oh btw, thought I'd add this since it was hilarious, we saw and an older dude (white hair) wearing a shirt in bold lettering, 'MILF HUNTER'. I couldn't get a pic cuz he was rocking out just like the rest of us. Another great sober moment of the night. Only in Vegas!. Love this groomer. Very good at getting my pet cut exactly the way my room mate and I like her. She is adorable after they put bows in her hair. My doggie loves her groomer and looks forward to going there for her monthly bath and haircut.. The location is great but personally I've had better. The original froyo was slightly more icy than I would have liked. 

The staffers were great/super-friendly and offered sample cups as we walked in. There are a lot of topping options and yogurt flavors. The price is really good!

They have ipads along the walls which definitely adds to their decor.. Love the French toast.  It was busy, but we were seated right away and got our food quickly.  I would go back. Always accommodating, wonderful group of people.  Knowledgeable about hair.  I came here and Elmira took care of my weave and helped my natural hair grow past shoulder length so I don't have to wear a weave anymore.  The people in the shop are good with natural and processed hair!  Thank you!. Scott is the best!  He got my 250 ninja back up and running after it had been sitting for 2+ years (and without judgement or scolding).  When he had it all pulled apart he explained what he was looking at, what he was going to do and made suggestions for maintenance that didn't need to be done right away, but should be addressed in the near future if I was going to start riding regularly again.  When he couldn't revive the battery and didn't have one that would fit the bike in his truck, he came back later in the afternoon after some of his other jobs (after dark I might add) to install the new battery.  On top of being extremely knowledgeable about bikes and doing great work with a great attitude and professionalism, his prices are fantastic!  A welcome change from the price-gouging I get at the dealer.  

Thank you Scott!  You (and your truck) ROCK!. EVERYTIME I am in vegas i stop here on my way home and get at least three dozen donuts and a box of munchkins because it is the closest dunkin donuts to long beach, ca. although its always busy when i go in the morning, its worth the wait, and the service is great!. What can I say, it's a Five Star school and they have done wonders for my kids, so I give them five Yelp stars! They actually deserve more than five stars, more like six or seven! 
Currently Bilbray ES is ranked the #2 elementary school in the Clark County School District and that's not too shabby out of almost 300 elementary schools! Actually that's amazing! 

My kids used to go to another school in the district that I will leave nameless, this school was ranked in the lower 200's and was only a three star school. Needless to say my kids were truly getting left behind and just shuffled along in the mix of kids. My daughter is Dyslexic and that school failed to help her in any way, even after I told the school what she needed. I was doing all the work and still not getting any help for her, they didn't seem to care :-( 

After extensive research on elementary schools in Clark County, my husband and I found Bilbray ES. Once we decided that Bilbray was the school for us, we actually moved and bought our current house a block away from Bilbray ES just so our daughter and son could get enrollment into this school. After the other school failed my kids, we meant business! 
This was a life changing decision for my kids! Bilbray ES has gone out of their way to help my daughter with her Dyslexia and now it is almost unrecognizable in her! She went from an F student who could not read that had to repeat the first grade, to and A/B honor roll student that is in the highest level reading groups in her class! 
The speech therapist at Bilbray is a miracle worker and my son is thriving with her help. This school has a great staff and they are wonderful with all of the students. 

Bilbray ES also offers lots of programs at this school that aren't at other schools, such as Drill Team, Tumbling, and Garden Club. They also have lots of family friendly events throughout the year such as carnivals, renaissance fairs, and family nights. 
If you live in this neighborhood, this is hands down the school you should send your kids to.. Oh, Savor Cafe. I'd been hearing such great things about you but hadn't had a chance to stop in until a Friday night two weeks ago when my cousins were in town. Everything I'd heard was true - you have great southern style food at reasonable prices. 

On to the menu: 
1. Drinks - get the strawberry lemonade. If you need an adult beverage, get the strawberry lemonade with vodka in it. Do not miss out on this deliciousness. 
2. Dinner - on our table we had two orders of the pan fried pimento cheese chicken and one order of the chili salmon. Both were unbelievably good. And the horseradish mashed potatoes and collards (with smoked turkey instead of bacon for flavor) were also top notch. 
3. Dessert - we went for a trio of desserts to share. The peanut butter pie (creamy and delectable), the cobbler with ice cream (quite good), and the banana pudding. Now, I am not much of a banana pudding fan, but OH.MY.GOODNESS. was it good. By far the best dessert of the three. And I'm a huge peanut butter pie fan, so that's saying a lot. Get the banana pudding. Just do it. 

Next time I'm in the mood for southern vittles, I'll be heading your way, Savor. Not low fat, but totally worth the splurge.. I passed by this place around 5:00 PM and the line was wrapping around the whole place. I thought to myself wow this place must be good I should try it. So of course the next day for lunch I wanted to go to Earl of Sandwich. It was around 1:00 PM and there were only a couple of people in line. I ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chicken sandwich the Wisconsin Cheddar soup, and the frozen lemonade. Way too much food but I had to try everything. Oh my goodness!!! It was all so good. Best sandwich I have ever eaten. It's a little pricey but I think it's worth it. I suggest you buy everything and share it with someone so you can enjoy different things and not get too stuffed. I definitely recommend this place and if I ever cross paths with another Earl of Sandwich I will without doubt eat there again.. What a great find. The service is fantastic, the restaurant is clean & everything we ordered was delicious. The tom yam is some of the best I've had in many years. The broth is rich & flavorful; there are lots of noodles & the portion was generous.. took my boyfriend on a great little date night here on sunday. he is a huge carrabba's fan who has corrupted me with their addictive bread they bring out. is there crack in that olive oil?? beware not to fill up on it though. i suggest their chicken marsala. the chicken was melting in my mouth. those mushrooms just topped off the flavor that was coming from that chicken. i opted to be a little healthy and got their veggie of the day that happened to be my favorite...spinach! (yes i'm popeye!) i mixed it all up and even dug the spinach with the chicken and mushrooms. Dan T. is a huge fan of their chicken parm. everytime we go that is exactly what he gets. doesn't even have to look at the menu. we shared some fettucini alfredo that wasn't too bad, but it wasn't the best i have had either. i would def come to carrabba's over olive garden any day. the service is quick and on point. the staff is always friendly. the food doesn't take forever to come out. i know it isn't a top notch italian restaurant, but they did win me over and i know i will be back. (and not just because my boyfriend is the fan. i am now one too.)
now pass me over some of that bread and oil please!. Now you just can't go wrong with a burrito, freshly made, that's smothered with
red chile sauce & melted Jack cheese or verde sauce & Cotija cheese with sour cream & freshly made pico de gallo. Mmmm mmmm!  that's what you get at Baja Fresh if you order any of their delicious burritos "enchilado" style.

On my last visit, I ordered the Nacho Burrito . . . enchilado style. . . I wasn't disappointed.  Muy bueno!

Couple that with their homemade salsa collection from their fabulous salsa bar, and your tastebuds will dance.

Baja Fresh is my happy place. . . . I walk out of there satisfied and usually with half my burrito for dinner. Large portions, tasty fresh food . . . can't be beat!. I had a great experience buying my new Soul. The process was painless. I worked with CJ. I knew that I wanted a Soul and I had gotten approved online for a loan. He talked to me about the options, pricing, colors and features available. He knew my budget and made sure he showed me the Souls that fit into my budget. I ended up flipping a coin to decide between two colors. I ended up with a sunroof. Yay ;-) Nemo was awesome at walking me through the features of my new Soul.. Amazing food, I still can't stop talking about this place to friends. My husband and I stumbled upon this gem while searching for a place to eat. We ordered the spicy herbs spring roll as an appetizer, which made us instantly want to order more of them. They have just the right amount of veggies and meat. The wrapping was not hard or chewy which is a problem we usually run into. I ordered the tofu soup as my entree and it was reminded me of growing up and eating soup that my parents made me when I wasn't feeling well. Very simple with so much flavor. My husband ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and it was just spot on. Best Thai food in Las Vegas.. Great food at a reasonable price and we've always had good service.  Their lobster mac and cheese is great but very rich so probably a good idea to share or get vegetables as well.  My fiance and I recently tried their cooking demonstration.  It was a little more expensive than I would have liked but it was great!  AND there was a wine pairing with each course.. Just like everyone else, I really enjoy the pork belly steamed buns for an appetizer. The Chiang Mai Curry is amazing! The place is super cute and trendy. Only downside is cash only.. I am so happy I discovered Seasons 52! My honey and I went here to enjoy the restaurant week menu, and, wow, was it a treat! It's easy to find good in the valley, but it's a bit harder to find good restaurants that are great for health-conscious individuals or diners with special food needs (lactose-free, vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free). The wine list is long and varied, which was a little intimidating at first, but our server was helpful in offering suggestions and sample tastes to make sure we were happy with our selections. 

I have to mention that despite the rolling menus of seasonal dishes, almost every dish has nutrition info posted online (and available in calorie trackers like myfitnesspal). This makes meal planning and decision-making beyond easy. 

At $30 per person, the restaurant week menu provided more food and higher quality options than many of the restaurants at the higher price points. Much of the special menu was selected from the standard autumn menu, so even returning to order from the normal menu, you would find similar or same options. 

Included was a shared roasted tomato flatbread, and a salad, entrée, and dessert each. The flatbread was crispy, tangy, and wonderful, and the salads were fresh and interesting. But the main course was the highlight. Both of us ordered the filet mignon (medium), and it was perfection from plating to palate. The flavors of the mashed potatoes (great texture with skin still included), broccolini, and mushrooms complemented the filet well, but the red wine sauce brought everything together and tied it up nicely with a little bow. Because no meal feels complete without something sweet at the end, the dessert shooters are a must: small in size but big in flavor and very satisfying with an espresso or coffee to go with. The perfect end to an thoroughly enjoyable meal. 

So good that we are thinking of going again before the week is over!. So read about this place on Yelp but i was a little concerned about the area. 75th and McDowell isn't the best neighborhood but I am so glad I went to the old Westridge area(know known as Desert Sky since it sounds less gang-ish). Anyway the food was great. They do both take out and sit down and we decided to stay. The place was very clean, food was fast and excellent. The Tom Yam Gai soup was amazing. My and the Hubby like it spicy and this sop delivered, we were very glad we didn't ask for extra spice, the soup had enough kick. The only strange thing about the soup is that it had tomatoes in it. I've had Tom Yam Gai soup many times at many places but never with tomatoes but it was still excellent. 

We split the Spicy basil chicken and again it was very yummy. There was a great balance of flavors as well as plenty of meat in the dish. 

The portions were plentiful we split the soup and an entree and we took soup and the entree leftovers home. 

Definitely worth going to!! I'd give it 5 stars but the area is well....75th and McDowell but i will go back, besides if it gets to well known I wont have my new secret Thai restaurant anymore!!!. Good food , good service , thier steak burritos is the awesome ,everybody have to try it. I have always loved Wataburger. Except one night when my bf and I went to grab a burger, they were having some kind of research group(taste testing their food). In the 20 mins we were there we watched them throw away at least 15-20 uneaten burgers. This made me so upset to see them waste so much, there are so many hungry people in this world. Other then this research group, i love that place. We originally intended to order from Grimaldis, but after the rude service on the phone, we opted for Rocco's instead. Very happy with our decision! Garlic knots are killer. Pizza was good as well. Amazing food!!  Located at the Four Queens Hotel in Downtown Las Vegas.  Our friends took my husband and I to this wonderful place and we were not disappointed.  It has an old Las Vegas feel, you think that you are back in the 1950's.  You will have a waiter, a server, and a wine sommelier.  Awesome. 

Come and enjoy this delicious meal.. Amazing burger, drinks and service. Haven't tried the sushi but I've heard good things. Never a disappointment!. On a business trip in WI and wanted to try something different for supper.  I definitely found a great type of food that I have managed to miss until now.  Korean food may replace Thai as my favorite Asian food.  I had the kimchi jjigae which is a kind of cabbage stew with onions and lots of other wonderful veggies.  I had the tuna but could have chosen pork.  The tuna was wonderful and the soup brought together so many wonderful tastes and textures that I will definitely be searching for Korean food when I get back home!  I began the meal with an order of spring rolls which were crispy as few restaurants can accomplish.

Service could not have been better.  If you are in Middleton, Wi and looking for some awesome combinations of subtle spices, warm and friendly service and an enjoyable evening, you should definitely try this place!. An e-mail conversation with a fellow Yelper yesterday reminded me of how much I love stinky food.  So I had to satisfy my craving for such today with a nice kielbasa (or is that kolbassi) from Wiener World.  M-M-M-M load that baby up with onions!   Dee-lishous!  Now will someone please pass me the Listerine?

I also promise I'll hit the treadmill and the elliptical trainer tonight!. Found out about this place from the vets on base. One of the vet that works at the Nellis vets office also works here at 'Heaven can Wait' or thats what my husband told me anyways. They said nothing but good things about this place so i figured I'd go there. Plus... military discounts ;)

Just got my doggy fixed and up to date on shots, and microchipped yesterday. The staff here are super friendly and nice, but they did scare me when they talked about anesthesia and side effects and chances of this and that and bla bla... I cried my eyes out when i dropped my doggy off, but they assured me she was gonna be okay and that they'd take extra good care of her :) Yep, what can i say... I'm a big baby :) and yeah, I cried some more once i picked up my doggy haha. I guess i was just so happy to see that she was ok! Yay for cry-babies like me!. Oh Sardella's how I love you. This is the only pizza we ever eat. The crust, sauce and cheese are a perfect  harmony. We always get delivery and when the pizza arrives it's always fresh,hot and gooey. The Gold Fever wings are awesome a honey mustard with a kick. Honey BBQ is great too. It is a little on the pricey side though..for delivery of a large pepperoni, xtra cheese and 20 wings its about $30. They do charge a small delivery fee, I think it's $2.50. If you don't want to cook, order Sardella's.. A unique and great find in downtown Carnegie. My fiance and I came here for a weekend lunch and wanted something different from our usual weekend spots. We had the sausage stuffed pepperoncini's as an appetizer (these are never my favorite and were just OK, but the marinara served with them was very tasty, as was their homemade bread), I had a really great wood fired meatball/ ricotta pizza and fiance had the chicken parm sandwich. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. I ordered a cannoli on the way out the door and it was FANTASTIC. Not overly sweet, crunchy-chocolate dipped shell stuffed with thick cream and mini chocolate chips. Amazing. We will definitely be back here!. We go to Vegas about twice a year and have a tradition of always going to see Penn and Teller the first night that we are in town. In fact, I book my stays on whether or not Penn and Teller are performing. 
They definitely keep it fresh and even if you have seen them on tv or live, they will most like still do something that you haven't seen before. 
This show is well worth seeing in my opinion!. I have been coming here for quite a while now. They do a great job ans the prices are very reasonable.  They are very friendly and always welcome walk-ins. They do get quite busy on the weekends. Their Spa Pedicure is AWESOME!!!. Barry Tenenbaum is amazing!! These guys know what they are doing. They are friendly, honest and always explain the work needed clearly. I went in thinking I would need body work for a large dent in my bumper. He was able to just push it out from the inside saving me $500 deductible. I think most shops would have taken advantage of a situation like that. Thank you Barry you rock! Keep doing what you are doing.. Vrrrrwwwwwww!   Time to fly!  

I know I haven't been to that many airports, but I do like Charlotte Douglas!  I feel that it's pretty big, and while walking through the walkways are big enough to where you aren't always bumping into people.  The main area where the concourses split is nice with a big open view.  It's nice and southern with the rocking chairs for you to sit in as well.  

I also really like this airport because it seems so clean the times that I get here.  From the moment I step out of my car to the check-in, and then all the way to my gate for take off.  The bathrooms are always well kept too.

I'm a person that likes little fun details, and on my walk through Concourse A, I noticed that they have movie posters up of all the movies filmed in Charlotte (like Shallow Hal, Talladega Nights, Hunger Games, etc.).  Fun stuff!

I'm sure that people who have to stop by CLT for a layover shouldn't be sad to be in a nice airport like this.. Went on a Tuesday night for the $20 wine and bruschetta deal. We waited about 45 minutes but ended up with a lovely and romantic table outside. We ordered a bottle of Albarino and a selection of bruschetta. They are not reinventing the wheel or anything but, what they are doing, they are doing it very well. Service was friendly too which only added to the overall experience.. This is one of those places I don't go to often, so when I do, it's always exciting. The smoky aroma that you smell as you walk up to the place gets my mouth watering lol. They start you off with these fresh biscuits that come with whipped apple butter. For the appetizers, you should definitely try the fried green tomatoes. My boyfriend's favorite is the Mardi Gras chicken. It is easily one of the best dishes on their menu. I mean, look at that picture I posted. Serious shit, my friends(I mean that in the best way possible). I love the blackened catfish. It comes perfectly cooked, smoked, and seasoned. It is one of my favorites. This place never lets me down. If you are ever in the red rock casino don't hesitate to stop by this place. You won't be disappointed.. Coffee world, heavens gates, the wind beneath my wings. Great tacos, quick service cheap prices. It's tough to find quality lunch options in north town (that aren't Chipotle, Five Guys, etc!), so I'm always happy to hear about any locally-owned joints in the Nellis area. 
The burritos here are really popular, but they're too huge for me, so I stick to the tacos. Steak, carnitas, asada are all delicious, but the standout is definitely the al pastor. If you're in the area, El Tizon is worth a look!. This place is too small & since they're one of the most popular sushi restaurants & conveniently located near The Strip, it's no wonder they're always busy & no longer take reservations. I've had a couple of bad experiences when I would go with my family or boyfriend & they would be too busy that they'd forget to bring in our last order. After countless times of refusing to order ice cream while we wait & reminding them about the last order, a couple of the waitresses told us it was our fault & warned us not to do it next time. Wtf? Whatever, star deducted for their poor service but I still effing love the sushi specials.. Probably Madison's most famous restaurant and with good reason. If I have a friend coming to visit me, I will always take them here, and they will always be pleased. The menu is all-american with a Wisconsin twist (lots of cheese, brats, and pretzels). While I think they could do a little better as far as offering healthy options, this is also Wisconsin. Lastly, every time I have been here, the staff has been very friendly and given great service. Which is no surprise because  they have such an intense vetting process for prospect employees. They  have two callback interviews and have their candidates to work one shift before they know if they were hired!. Overall, I love this place.. Everyone reviewed about the $7.77 special already, but I'll just add onto the hype. A pretty fulfilling piece of steak, three shrimps, mashed potatoes, and a salad! Every time my bf and I go to Vegas, we always have to stop by Mr. Luckys. Duh, who can pass up that price AND the great meal! Service is a bit slow, but they're friendly so I never mind much.. My husband and I went here for a date night on 6/28/08 and it met all my expectations by far.  The food was to die for.  We both can't wait to go back.  I had some pomegranate green tea to drink that was really yummy.  Then we shared the Stetson Salad.  I am a vegetarian so they substituted the chicken or salmon for chunks of avocado.  Yummy!  This was just the best chopped salad every.  I don't think I can remember everything in it but the many different colors, shapes and textures were just thrilling.  It had dried corn, couscous, the avocado, lettuce.....and some pesto ranch or something like that...

For dinner I had the mushroom panfry.  I have to say that I am not a huge fan of mushrooms.  I like them but I don't love them.  That said the waitress said it was the best vegetarian option and the reviews on it were so good that I went ahead and got it.  It has like 14 different kinds of mushrooms all cooked together in a tomatoey sauce with a couple triangles of polenta to eat with it.  It was good.  I was impressed.  Now I don't think I would order it again but that is just because mushrooms aren't really my thing.  If they are your thing I bet you will drool all over this dish.

My husband had some expresso crusted filet mignon.  He said it was one of the best cuts of steak he had in his life.  He also really liked to flavor of the coffee on it.  I had to feed him a bite just so I could experience the cutting of it with the fork.

For dessert we had the goat cheese cheesecake.  I think that is what kind of cheese it was.  I loved the filling of the cheesecake but not so much the crust or the sprinkles on top.  They reminded me of uncooked sugar cookies.. I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try. also try the Boba I think it is the best I have had but I have had it at only one other place. The staff is friendly and everything is pretty quick to order. no complaints so far.. I had one of Julie's massage for the first time in my life. She did trigger point on me which got out all the kinks in my body. Thanks Julie! Best massage ever!!! I suggest everyone to try it just once, and then become a regular like me. Got a coupon in the mail was wanting to try this place out we did we were pleased it was hot it was clean and they were nice. A group of ten of us went last night, and none of us had eaten at Legume before. We had heard nothing but great things and were anxious to go.
The new location is fantastic. A very classy and beautiful atmosphere.
If someone asked if it were fancy, I would say yes. Although, not the kind of fancy that they focus on presentation more than the portions. The portions were big, the quality was great and very tasteful. The service was incredible as well. We had Tate wait on us and he was very educated, informative and helpful. You could tell that the staff worked well together to make everyones experience top notch.  We had a wonderful night out and will definitely be coming back!. Best service at a Subway I've ever received!  And the ladies were blasting the best 80's dance music!

And to some the Tuna sandwich sounds gross, but it's actually very good.  Try it toasted!. herro I miss you come back into my life.

Why is this place so freakin good? Why?

The first time I had it I thought it sucked. I got the italian and it tasted like shit and I threw it away. The second time I had it was because I was  starving and alone because everyone else ate without me while I slept (the fuckers) SO i decided to mosey down the elevator and stumble over to mr. Earl. Got the original and now I cannot stray. Extra Dijon a pepsi and that shit is gone. 
Yum crispy tenderness. Roast beef is so melt in mouth good I wonder if they have cooked it long enough. 
THe third time i went there i got the original with pasta salad and a pepsi. I literally had to be rolled out of there. SO much food, so good. 

I will come back another day. ANother time my friend. They also have breakfast sandwiches. But its like 7am  to 11am . Who the eff wakes up before 11 in vegas, unless you just stay up all night, it is earl's so it might just be worth it.. I think it is time that I write a review for this joint! I have been coming to TLC Wash N Clean on and off for the last 7 years. This laundry mat has an attendant there at all times. You can even drop off items to be cleaned for you. A lot of washers (some regular size and some gigantic!) and lots of dryers. There is also a soda and snack machines and bottled water or ice cream for sell. If you need quarters.. you can get them there from a machine or buy rolls from the attendant as well. Free wifi and flatscreen on the wall to watch TV (satellite) while waiting for your laundry to finish. Definitely love coming here. Get my laundry done within an hour and a half and I am back home!. Really cute deli my family always stop at on our way to the cabin. It has frech delicious food. And the interior is really pretty. Get your sandwhich on the asiago bread. Delicious!. OMG. This place is amazing!
The waiting was pretty horrible, about an hour or so but it was worth it. I had brunch and the cost was very reasonable!
The eggs Benedict were spectacular, so was the pasta. A lot of different options, I couldn't even get to 50% of the food. Dessert was amazingly good... 
I totally recommend this place!. I had never been to a Brazillian Restaurant and I must say they are definetly carniverous!  First we started off to the salad bar and the smoked salmon was fantastic!!! They had a salad dressing that was green, I believe it was cesar with cilantro it was absolutely delish!!!  Now at your table you have a coaster, one side is red and one side is green.  When you flip it over to green watch out cause they will be coming at you with all cuts of beef, chicken, sausage, pork, lamb... oh my!  It was very tasty... was TRYING to try everything but it might be impossible for some.  So I had to flip my coaster back over to red!!!  You are also brought sides to go with your carniverous plate... we were served fried polenta, mash potatoes, fried bananas.  You can also opt to go back to the salad bar where they have fried red potoates, rice and black beans.  All in all was a delicous experience.  I know you might ask how was the desert??? and  yes we did do deserts.  We shared the creme brulee, oh my so light and tasty, the chocolate molten lave cake ala mode another fav at our table.  You may not have to eat for 2 days after you've been here!!! This place is great fun for a larger parties!. Great new spot in Morningside.  Good coffee at great prices. They have pastries, soups and sandwiches. The staff and owner are friendly and knowledgeable. Refillable to stay cups and a great environment with outdoor seating make it a place to spend some time!. We really liked this lounge found in the MGM.  It's decor is extremely modern/chic, but it wasn't packed or anything.  There were tables available and they had very good martinis (lychee!) and a pretty decent wine list.

We kept saying how we wished there was a place like this in LA but that would never happen.  If it were in LA it'd probably be packed and I'd "probably be having some girl's martini spilled on me by now".. I've practised yoga on and off for the past 20 years and this is the first time I'm actually committed to my practice. I don't know if it is because I'm older now (younger in some respects, he he) and I'm coming to terms with myself to embrace exercise and have healthier habits (about time!!!), or perhaps I've tried oh so many other sporting disciplines that were not for me...  Perhaps it's a mix of all these but one thing I'm sure: it's been easier the moment I walked in the Yoga Bristo School and now I think I've finally found the place to finally commit. And I say this after practising different types of yoga (apart from sports) in many different places. 

Even though the school offers different "types" of yoga (vinyasa, hot vinyasa, power yoga and some others I can't recall now), they focus on Ashtanga Yoga (very powerful and energetic practice) and the Mysore style (self-practice). I started with their Beginners Block (8 classes, one session a week), went on to their Beginners 2 Block and have found the practice so engaging that I'm now attending 6 days a week (combining self-practice and sessions led by an instructor). I'd recommend people who do not know anything about yoga to start with one or two sessions a week. Then, if you feel like you can engage a bit more, go for more constant regular self-practice Mysore style. It's worked for me. Self-practice starts early in the morning and the instructor is there to help your with specific postures.

In the past 4-5 months, there have been renovations in the studio (the school is located in the basement of an old church that is now a shelter, see map and photos) and now there are two  rooms for yoga practice. There's also a reception where you can also buy some yoga items (tops, leggings, mats, books, healthy snacks, etc). The staff is very friendly and generally very patient to answer all kind of questions about yoga practice. Instructors are always very helpful and careful dealing with your individual strengths or weaknesses. The school has also hosted teachers from other countries to give workshops and help with the mysore self-practice (at the moment of writing this review, we have a great instructor from Philadelphia). This is a very enriching experience.

You can check their website for more information about the services they offer. It's important to register online so that you can book your classes, though you can also book and pay classes at the reception too. There are also classes for students of the University of Edinburgh (the school hosts the University's Yoga Society) and discounts if you're a student. There are also social yoga-oriented events during the year (chanting sessions, movie nights), making this school a lively yoga community.. Hawaiians, for whatever reason, love Vegas.
Hawaiians, for whatever reason, love staying at the Cal Hotel when they go to Vegas.
Hawaiians, for whatever reason, will spend their last waking moments in Vegas... literally an hour before they take the early evening flight on Hawaiian Airlines back to the islands... eating local Hawaiian food at Aloha Specialties at the Cal Hotel!

At least this was what was going on when I was here the Sunday after Thanksgiving. We waited in that long-ass line close to HALF AN HOUR. I struck up a conversation with the woman behind me about how the tap water in Vegas tastes terrible. (For those of you who aren't aware, the tap water in Hawaii is magically delicious.)

Alright, now for the actual review. This place is like a Zippy's with a much longer wait but a much smaller menu. However, for a mainland Hawaiian restaurant, the prices are very reasonable and the portions are generous. My dad and I both ordered the fried saimin (which to my dismay was mediocre... should have gone for the $4.95 large regular saimin!). My mom got some special Japanese lunch box (which I forget the name of), and my sister ordered the Korean-style beef and chicken plate lunch combo, which was really good. The mac salad hit the spot too.

There are a number of Hawaiian places around Vegas, but my guess is that this is the place to go if you wanna feel that real spirit of Aloha. Maybe that's just because it's full of Hawaiians in an extra good mood because they're grindin on yummy authentic local food. Just be prepared to WAIT.

Took a spam musubi ($1.50) to go, and ate it while I waited for my flight back to SF. I bet I got a bunch of weird looks by those unaware of the power of something resembling a oversized, angular sushi roll... but I don't care!. This is one of the best sandwich shops I've been to in Tempe.. The Mad Greek in Baker, CA has been a staple of my families many road trips back and forth to Southern CA. We would either stop on the way from Vegas or on our way back to Vegas. 

Naturally we had to check this restaurant out since it had the same name and the same infamous fresh strawberry shake. In the past year that we have discovered this place we have been here numerous times for dinner, cocktails and their wonderful happy hour. 

Between their fair pricing on their food, their personable staff and their knack for accommodating children, I have to say that I have grown to really love this place. Happy Hour is my favorite time to go, its for a couple of hours between 4pm - 6pm and offers great HH prices on drinks (beer, wine and mixed drinks) and has a pretty good tapas-esque HH menu. I was here recently for happy hour with my 2 year old son and my girlfriend. Neither of us had any cocktails but we ordered quite a bit from the tapas menu. I always start with a HH sized Greek salad, its my favorite, so full of flavor including olives and tons of feta. I order the Greek fries with feta for my son who loves french fries (these are more like home-style fries,) and the spanikopita (spinach and cheese filled phyllo dough.) My friend ordered the coconut shrimp, a small Greek salad and the goat cheese flambe (which was not en flambe lol.) We shared everything we had and it was ALL so yummy!  We were all full and the bill came out to be about $30 or so. You really cannot beat that price for all the food we got. 

One of the other reasons I like coming to the Mad Greek is how kid-friendly they are. Every time we are there the employees light up when they see my son and my son equally lights up when he sees the Mad Greek sign. After every meal they always ask if its ok to give him an ice cream sundae and always check to make sure he is a happy camper. The Greek has a dance floor with a stage for the times they do live music (which is GREAT!) and my son loves to get on that dance floor and show his moves off - they all love it. 

Make sure to sit outside when the weather is a bit warmer, the patio is (as other reviewers have stated) in a parking lot but it is closed off and has a great ambiance, especially at night with the heat lamps and the fire pit. The Mad Greek is often on Restaurants.com and getting a certificate is a great way for a first timer to try out the restaurant. OPA!!. I'm not ashamed to admit it - I was skeptical.  As a long-time lover of Pamela's, I just couldn't see this place making me happy when we discovered Pamela's in the Strip was closed on Memorial Day.  The wait was torturous at the Dor-Stop too...however, it was a holiday so I suppose i understand.  And when we did finally get seated, the AMAZING hot cakes, SUPERB hash browns, and perfectly cooked eggs really made my morning!

I prefer my hot cakes to be thin and flat, and when I saw the ones here, I was unsure again.  But the taste will BLOW YOUR MIND.  I got the apple cinnamon ones - they are crispy yet fluffy with apples that taste very fresh and just the right amount of cinnamon.  I even enjoyed the butter as a sweet additive to a decadent treat!  The potatoes were also amazing - true lyonnaise style with crispy outsides, warm insides, and plenty of onions.  Eggs were standard fair, but overeasy is often executed poorly... so props for getting it exactly right.  Several of my friends also ordered different flavors of hot cakes and suggested the oatmeal ones are really not to be missed as well.

Despite the long wait and weird waitress, we all LOVED our breakfast and I was full for hours after.  YUM!  Can't wait to go back!. i absolutely adore this zoo. it's free, which is awesome, and they have a ton of great animals, and even a few that i haven't seen at other zoos! they seem to be working really hard to expand and re-vamp a few of their exhibits. it also has a lot of little kid-friendly things, like a real handprint of a gorilla to compare yours to, face-in-hole type cutouts, a carousel, playgrounds, etc. it's small enough to see in a couple of hours, but so much to do, you could spend an entire day with a picnic there.. The Fatburger is one of the best burgers in town, and the best fries ever! They also have super quick service so you have your food in no time. You can't go wrong with a Fat deal! It's a heart attac waiting to happen, but oh so good!. Wow! I love this store...I stopped here on a whim and ended up buying lots of things I never had before including Bulgarian Wine. Not bad! 

The fresh meat selection looks great, even some already marinated... super excited they had lamb and it looked fresh and the prices seem reasonable.  Next time I'll get some lamb...This time I got a few different deli meats... included lots of things I've never had before.  So many eating and shopping adventures to be had here!. Pumpkin Marsala Chai.  Tasted just like gingerbread.  I am almost willing to drive the 30 minutes out of my way to get one before work everyday.  I waited almost three months, since I heard the news that they were opening, and went in for their opening celebration.  I was not disappointed.

Their coffee does not have the bitter taste like starbucks but is not overly sweet like the Caribou Coffee was, though I do love Caribou.

The staff was friendly and had personality!  The cashier, as we were leaving, asked how I liked the chai!  She was genuinely interested which was nice. This will for sure be a hangout/study home for me.. This place never disappoints. I've eaten at  both the Los Angeles and Pasadena, CA location. The Scottsdale location did not disappoint!  The decor here was nicer than the other locations, still rocking that chic and hip vibe that the W hotel and roku restaurants always have. We came with a large group of people, so we ordered a ton of dishes. Here are some highlights and must haves:
1) yellow tail with diced green chile: paper thin slices of hamachi bathed in a yuzu sauce topped with tiny pieces of diced green and red chile. It was delicious as always!
2) spicy tuna on crispy rice: i always order this at every establishment that offers it on the menu and I find that roku does it the best. The rice it's served on is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and comes out warm. It's piled on high with spicy tuna that's bursting with flavor and heat. 
3) miso marinated cod: this is another dish I always order when it's available. It's not as good as Nobu Matsuhisa's, but still delicious. The fish is so delicate, it flakes apart easily with a fork and melts in your mouth releasing the flavors and sweetness of both the fish and miso marinade. Absolutely delicious!
4) Chilean sea bass: this is another really delicate fish that had great flavor and served nicely seasoned sautéd spinach. 
5) crunchy spicy tuna and avocado roll: tuna and avocado with tempura flake crust
6) spicy tuna and shrimp in rice paper roll (I forget the actual name of it): the rice paper gives this roll a unique and delicious flavor. 
7) rock shrimp: tempura style mixed with a sweet sauce.  
8) mixed seafood tempura: the batter was light and flaky. The scallop and asparagus were my favorites. 
9) edamame (soybeans): made al dente and came out steaming hot to our table lightly salted. Delicious! 

Everything here from the service to the food to the ambience is great. This place rocks!!. I just finished my dinner that I picked up tonight from Chia Bistro. This restaurant happens to be in my neighborhood, so I thought I would give it a try. I don't usually take the time to write reviews, but I really felt like giving credit where credit is due. 

I ordered scallops and mixed vegetables. There was a generous helping of large scallops that were cooked to perfection and delicious. Also, there was quite a variety of vegetables that were carefully cooked, so that they were not too crunchy or too limp and bursting with flavor. The meal was served in a delicate brown sauce, which was carefully seasoned and absolutely delicious!  Wow! I was so happy to find this treasure right in my neighborhood!. One of the best burger places in town with the best prices.

They have a "secret" menu on Instagram. Half the stuff on IG is not on the menu. But basically you just show them a picture on IG and they'll make it for you, even tweak it for you if you wanted to add or subtract items. 

I got the Avocado burger with egg. It was literally bigger than me. Like I am a very neat eater, I don't like to get dirty. But beware, if you're like me, you will get as messy as hell! I did not know how to eat it at first because it was so gigantic. And for about 8$ it was definitely much worth it! My boyfriend got the Bulgogi burger with an extra patty and that was even more massive! 

Also they have the best shakes I ever had. It is literally heaven on earth. We got the Cinnamon Toast Crunch shake and it was so good. I really really wanted to get the tiramisu shake but they ran out of tiramisu. That was the only disappointing thing about our meal. 

They also have Mexican food that I hear is pretty damn good. So next visit that is what I will be trying out. 

Now once you arrive it's in a pretty awkward place. It's usually deserted and not in the best side of town but really it is worth it. Do not judge a book by its cover.

The guy that helped us was awesome, very helpful and informative. He mans the IG account and post the best pictures of the food. 
 
Can't wait to come back.. We found this restaurant through yelp and were able to make a reservation that same day.  Although the restaurant was very busy when we arrived, we were seated immediately. The atmosphere is amazing, mood lighting, but not so much private (we were in between two tables) One side is a booth, and the other side is chairs so there is a long booth with tables split with a space wide enough to allow you to sit down on the booth.  Although there is some indication that this restaurant is not kid friendly, it completely is.  They have a kids menu and crayons, which was enough to keep our kids entertained.  My son loved the pizza!  We also had a very patient waitress. In addition, I have a gluten allergy and they provide amazing gluten free bread before dinner and are very careful with the allergy. A little pricey, but you get what you pay for! I highly recommend.. This place is the best! Quality is always consistent and everyone is friendly and dedicated. Peter, the manager, is awesome. He is incredibly attentive and super skilled. This is the first time that I get acrylic and it doesn't look fake, rather completely natural. I break nails easily and every time I get them fixed by him they always look as they are my natural nails, none can tell the difference.

The salon is always clean and fresh and they have superb massage chairs. 

So worth it!!!!!. When you're visiting a city, it's certainly difficult to know which restaurants are right for your party. My friends and I took a chance on Nove and were very pleased. This flashy restaurant is perfect for a fun party or a romantic date. When ordering at Nove, I would recommend straying from pizza or pasta. I sampled a few dishes and loved every last bite. Why not order the octopus appetizer? It's Vegas, take a risk.. Going to Texas BBQ was a last minute decision in an unfamiliar area after meeting a client over the. I left the meeting feeling really hungry, so I got on to Yelp to find a place to eat. After seeing so many 5 star reviews, I had to check it out. Not only were the staff nice, but the food was amazing. We had the ribs, brisket, pulled pork, jalapeño sausage, green beans and coleslaw. I have never had such tender brisket or tasty ribs. It is worth checking out. I will definitely be back.. om nom nom nom. nom. 

I was pretty surprised that I would even want to eat at a $$ possibly $$$ Mexican restaurant since you can get $ burritos and tacos that are beyond authentic here in the Bay Area. 

I made reservations for 8 at 7:30; arrived late and were still promptly seated on a busy Friday night at prime dinner hour. The service was attentive and cordial, the food was delicious (hello Chicken and Seafood enchiladas, pork tacos and chicken fajitas!) and the price was reasonable compared to the normal Vegas tax that you would pay for premium food around here. 

Their margaritas were also especially notable, the fruit muddle is good but the MOJITO is just out of this world! ... and I don't even like mojitos! 

Overall, $35/person for entree, one appetizer (shared amongst 8) and a drink. Not too bad for a nice place in Vegas that has a nice vibe.

WARNING: don't order the guac, you'll regret it for $9 with what little they give you and how it's just okay.

OH and they don't tell you this but they only give you 2 tortillas with your fajitas (even though it probably requires 4) and they charge you $4 for additional tortillas!. I decided to make an afternoon run for my weekly lunches and certain items I missed last time I was there. I was rushed on my last visit but on a Monday at 11am I was able to take my time and really look. I planned to stop at East End Coop afterward if there was anything else I needed.

Goldmine! I found so many new salads, lemon chicken with apple, blue cheese walnut, spicy sesame chicken noodle, peanut ginger noodle, single serving spinach lasagna, 2 different Indian dishes, hummus with the salt pita chips, salt and vinegar chips, Omega 3 trail mix packets, plums, kiwi, and the score wasabi peas for 2.99. Giant eagle has them for $6. 

The ginger peanut noodle was not good. Weird bland chalky aftertaste everything else so far has been enjoyable.

I also got all my weekly essentials, veggie mix, eggs, milk, cherry juice, and brown rice! I have lunch and dinner for over a week with snacks for around $70. So I'll be grinding up those wasabi peas while my eyes water and my nose runs! The display of orchids set a nice mood for the shopping. Don't forget your reusable bags!

Note, they still don't have my pad thai noodle bowls or chicken breasts but found new items to replace them and I'm still hopeful! Plus no 2nd stop was needed.. Great treats and a beautiful display.. It's hard to put into words how amazing this place is.. the best I can do is SHOW you, by means of interpretive dance.

I tried the coffee and dessert trio, ate it, and then ran my butt back into that ridiculously long line to um.. bring back $40 worth of desserts for .... my.. mom..? (i'm sorry only 1/5 of the desserts made it home, mom)

Here's a tip: DON'T get the rose macaron because they're all mine and I refuse to share.. This is my first experience with a personal trainer and Ian kicks my butt every time. I can already feel changes for the better and am excited to see my progression over this winter.

Beware the eggplant. I kinda went into this place expecting to be dissapointed only because every crawfish place I come across I compare it to the boiling crab (a restraunt very similar to hotnjuicy) and im always let down...but this time I was strangely happy with the flavor...i ordered shrimp and they sell it to you by the pound...and 1lbs is plenty for one person! They serve it to you in a huge plastic bag and expect your hands to get dirty because there are no forks or spoons here!! The staff is very helpful and friendly! So overall I am a very happy camper :). Love korean or japanese food? This is THE place to get it! From fresh uni to tako yaki, jajangmyun to bulgogi, they've got a huge assortment of goodies to choose from! The meat selection is my favorite- last time I went I bought $50 worth of galbi, bulgogi, thinly sliced beef tongue, duck breast, ground meats, pork belly, beef slices for sukiyaki... plus an army of sauces [gochujang, bean paste, fish sauce, ponzu, salad dressings, etc] in all the sizes you could possibly need. There are huge bags of mineral salts, a well supplied produce section, a large refrigerated section with rows of noodles, natto, a huge frozen area with meats & dumplings, etc. I haven't tried the food court yet, but I might next time because the photos look yummy! There are open mini-store areas near the front that are mostly unoccupied, but I'm hoping they'll fill in soon because it has a lot of potential. It's pretty far from my side of town, but it's worth making the trek to stock up on awesome foods that are hard to find. I haven't seen skate or fresh uni anywhere else, and the marinated bulgogi is delicious! If you spend over a certain amount, they offer you a bag of rice for $.99. I'll be going back after my next payday! :}. Amazing fresh food and great lunch special prices. The servers were so courteous and helpful. Glad to make suggestions and didn't mind special requests. Fun dipping sauces and you can try as many as you want. The atmosphere is modern, bright and comfortable. The staff made our whole fAmily feel welcome.. Love love love this place! From the contemporary furnishings to the cuisine! Anthony in the lounge area was very attentive and welcoming. His recommendations were on point and the food was superb. The gnocchi was absolutely wonderful as well as the portobello fries. The chandelier cocktail was just right if you enjoy a sweet treat. My friend enjoyed the Prosecco. The happy hour times of 5-10pm and 12-2 are excellent and will have me back again. Who can beat 30% off?. This location is a little out of the way for me but I have gone there twice for karaoke night.  It was a lot of fun and not too crowded.  The crowd is very friendly and not that intimidating for potential first time karaoke goers.  

As always the food was great and the beer was cold.. Such a cool environment .. its awesome for partys snd the chefs always entertaining the guests I find it a very new york feeling... I love it. The food is great and so are the drinks , we went once for sushi .. it was great!! So fresh and clean.. Hands down, the best Vietnamese in the valley. Ever since I moved to Scottsdale from downtown Phoenix, I've been on a mission to find Vietnamese that compares. Nothing has Pho Thanh beat. I'm a regular there, and when I arrive, they know what I'm ordering. This is both sad and great!! I think I need a life outside Vietnamese food! In true Vietnamese service style, there are no frills. Don't come here expecting to be doted upon. Not going to happen. Go here because you want plentiful, cheap, flavorful, authentic Vietnamese food. The spring rolls are the best in the valley by far. I literally have tried 7 different Vietnamese restaurants, and I am starting to lose hope I'll find one close to home! I recommend the steamed chicken pho, spring rolls, and their great coconut water drink. It arrives in a full coconut with the top chopped off, and a straw! Great stuff. Just don't go on a Tuesday, they're closed!. I love this place!! They have the best mocha monsoon I have ever had and the best coconut whoopi pie - simply amazing.  The atmostphere is just as weonderful, quaint little gem to stumble upon.  A friend of mine brought me here a few months ago for the first time and now we are hooked!  We go all the time!! Fantastic little place, you wont regret going here.. I'm a member of another box in the Valley but dropped in on a Saturday w/a few friends for the Community WOD.  We had a great experience!  Will, the owner, along with the coaches and members, were extremely friendly and welcoming!  Great coaching, challenging WODs and their new facility is great!  CrossFit Black Storm seems to have a strong community!  I am looking forward to dropping in again soon!  Thank you so much for having us!. PRESSED CUBAN SANDWICH for the win! My friends and I came here on our last day in vegas for some good food. After seeing there were 752 reviews on yelp, 4 stars, we had to try it.

2 things I absolutely loved:

Pressed Cuban Sandwich - the patty is thick and SO JUICY!!!!! It has to be ordered a little pink, so be ready for that. Bobby Flay's thing is mixing up the spicy with the sweet, and sour. It's a perfect combination. I wasn't expecting to be blown away by southwestern food, but I really was. You also get to dip this delicious Cuban Sandwich into an aoili dip that makes the sandwich even better.

Not to mention, it comes with canjun fries which you don't even need ketchup for. Perfectly fried, crispy, crunchy and soft at the same time.

I also loved the:
Spicy beef tenderloin tartare  (appetizer). It comes with a little potato salad that you can taste the quality in. The beef tartare has capers in it, and has a lot of flavor in it compared to other ones I've had at other places. It's truly delicious. 

We also ordered:
Rough cut tuna nachos - they were spicy, and it was a good portion to be shared amongst 5 people. It had mango sauce in it, I'm allergic to mango so I'm a little biased on this dish.

Spicy chicken + Potato hash - it's basically an eggs benedict, southwest style. My friend ordered it, and it was good, but it gets sickening after a while because of the hollandaise sauce. I wish they served this with some veggies on the side or something, just to balance it out.

Grilled swordfish sandwich - If you really liek the taste of cooked swordfish, then go for it, I wasn't really impressed with this.

Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich - served cold, but great flavors and the pork is soft. Surprisingly, it taste a lot better than it looks. However, it sounds a lot better than it tastes. 

Thanks Mesa Grill, we'll be back on our next trip!. Recently I needed to get my nails fixed before going to a wedding for the week. I was unsure where to go and wanted to go on my way home which was around 5pm. They got me in quickly and there were multiple polish colors for me to choose from!! 

The only reason they are not receiving 5 stars is because even though they were very welcoming and quick the lady constantly talked in her other language with a co worker and continuously kept laughing. This made not only me a little uncomfortable but also  the lady next to me who even gave a look as if she couldn't believe what was happening.. This place is swiftly becoming my fave late night haunt while in Vegas! Went to dinner here two nights in a row this past weekend and was pleasantly surprised at their food. 
The first night I went with a group of friends, but I wasn't too hungry so had their Tex-Mex egg rolls which were pretty filling. They had some bite to it, thanks to all the delicious chili action going on. My friend's hubby got the Pad Thai, which he totally devoured and loved. While my egg rolls were tasty, I couldn't help but eye his noods.

The following night my best friend and I went for a late din after our concert and we were starving! Got the chicken lettuce wraps and a side of the house fried rice. WOW, the rice was amazing! I'm Filipino, was raised off Asian food and eat fried rice for breakfast more than I'd like to admit - I have to say that that was probably the best simple fried rice I've ever had! The lettuce wraps and the rice combination was simple and genius, two things I love! 

My BFF and I were thinking of going again for dinner but alas, we stayed on the strip but quite a ways away unforch. I would definitely go back in a heartbeat if not to only chow down on the lettuce wraps and fried rice - soooo delicious!  

The service the first night seemed a little off at first but then it ended up being fine. The second night our server was superb - he was the one who pointed out the lettuce wraps. Also, love the fact that they are generous in giving out refills!. This bar isn't young and hip but it is a blast! Everybody is pretty friendly, especially in the smoking section. 

They have awesome wing specials and their wings are the absolute best I've had in phoenix. Sounds weird but true. Their ranch must be made with the nectar of the gods because it is so god damn delicious.. This place is amazing!. Tried for the first time today after Weight Watchers recommended it. I had the Brazilian Chicken Flatbread on wheat. They were very busy at lunch but got my food out in 10 mins. The staff was so nice and so friendly =) Will be back....maybe even for dinner ; ). They have the best Hot and Sour soup I have had ever!!!!!  

Very nice people, will be my favorite spot from now on.  And they deliver locally.  

LOVED IT!. Easy to make appointments on line or calling in, no long waits for an appointment.  Appointments begin on time.  Dr Steed and staff - knowledgeable with great customer service.  Contacts and glasses come in within days of order.. After having yummy coffee in Portland, Oregon I was on a search to find something similar in Las Vegas. Suffice to say that Sambalatte fit the the bill. The staff is friendly and willing to answer any questions you may have without the "you should know the answer" attitude. Always a plus in my book I must say. This place is always busy. Since finding Sambalatte on Yelp I have managed to visit many times I have lost count. That's how great this place is. I have had the mocha latte as well as the chocolate cappuccino. Both delicious and they  look so beautiful you just want to admire from afar but can't help yourself to drinking them. The french macarons are good and so is the chocolate croissant. You sort of just want to stay there all day with a cup of coffee in  one hand. My daughter also enjoyed her hot chocolate with marshmallows and she also tried some sort of smoothie, which I also had a taste of she loved it as well.. I really, really like James Street. It's close to my house, and inviting, and they have fantastic food and a great beer selection. They have one of the best turkey burgers you can get - I even prefer it to their regular burgers. However, I can't get past two things: the price of the appetizers and the chips that come with everything. 

I'd love to be able to take coworkers to James Street for a drink after work, or catch up with friends on the weekends without committing to dinner, but I just can't. The appetizers have both small portions and high prices. Even something as simple as potato chips with a few tablespoons of dip is wildly overpriced.

That brings me to the second thing - the chips. They leave every meal feeling more like lunch, regardless of what time of day it is. I get it, they're cheaper to make than fries - but they also feel way cheaper. I hardly ever eat more than one or two of them. And for the prices you pay for food at James Street, being served chips feels like a disppointment every time.

I wish I could rank it up there with the best, but these two factors really drop it down a notch. However, it's still worthy of a visit - it's a gorgeous space with great programming and aaaaamazing creme brulee. Just skip the apps and be ready for a bland, boring side.. I have very little spare time with a newborn however, I wanted to make a point to write about my experience having Dr. Newman deliver our baby as it was truly exceptional.

I transferred to Dr. Newman mid pregnancy following the recommendation of my doula. I am so grateful that I did. I was impressed by the friendliness and professionalism of his office staff but more importantly I was so grateful to be in the care of an amazing doctor and surgeon. Dr. Newman was very honest, knowledgeable and supportive. I never once felt rushed during a visit and all my questions were answered thoroughly with patience. I ended up having a cesarian section due to a breech baby and the delivery (although I was initially terrified due to the unexpected) was an incredibly joyful experience. He made every effort to delay cord clamping and even let me hold my baby skin to skin right as he was born! I attribute my quick recovery to Dr. Newman's expertise and skill, in addition to the excellent care provided by the hospital staff at Banner Del E. Webb. I am so fortunate to have had the opportunity to have Dr. Newman as my care provider. I am hopeful that others' in search of an OB/GYN doctor will read this review and find it helpful in making a great choice.. Huge store! Probably the biggest Sports Authority i've ever been too! Love the selection for the women's clothing and all of the shoes! The lines can be long though and the store itself is kind of hidden by trees which is a shame. Employees were nice and the sale rack was a good size! Dressing room area could be a little bit bigger though.. my mexican and I went here for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. we sat inside next to the patio with a view of the bellagio fountains which was gorgeous. 

What we ordered:
-first they serve you a fresh french baguette with butter- delicious. 
-bowl of non-fat latte which was delish... a little cold though. 
-shared  the french onion soup... ho-ly YUM. seriously soooo good, very rich though. 
-I ordered the croque monsieur which was pretty good. it came with frites... a little to thin/ fried for me. reminded me more of a garnish.
-my mexican ordered their steak sandwich which he devoured.
-finished off with a butter & cinnamon crepe served with whipped cream on the side. this isn't on the menu, just something my cousin had recommended and OH.EM. GEE. seriously, so simple but SO SO SOOO good. the thing was HUGE (at least 10" in diam) and im pretty sure I ate 2/3 of it myself lol.

Service was ok... kind of slow but that was expected. we were happy to just be  hanging out with good food and a beautiful view. prob not the best place to go if you're wanting something quick.. Overall Experience: I would go back again

After reading the reviews, I thought it wouldn't hurt to try this nail salon out since I was on this side of town. 

I made an appointment at 5pm and was quickly seated and out by 5:50pm. The ladies were very nice and the service was quick, which are two things I really appreciate. I had one tech working on my pedicure and one tech working on my gel manicure. The quality of the product was above average, yet does not surpass the quality provided by my nail tech from my go-to nail salon. The pricing is average. It's not super expensive which is a plus.

My ombré g nails turned out beautiful and the regular pedicure with hot stones was relaxing; however, there are a few things that bother me. My nails were slightly sharp on the corners, which I can easily scratch myself by accident with or get caught in something. I'm not sure why it was not rounded to make sure the corners weren't sharp.

Secondly, one of the gels on my nail look completely off and for some reason appears more rounded. I think this was caused by drying my gel nails on the pedicure chair at an uncomfortable angle. I didn't have a choice and I'll give the tech the benefit of doubt that she didn't know that would happen

Finally, the massage chair. I like massage chairs but I was barely able to enjoy it because I was being simultaneously worked on. They turned it off after 10 minutes. 

Overall, I would go back again, but I would make sure that the minute detail problems won't happen again.. If i were to be reviewing this solely on my experience, I would probably give Gallagher's 5 stars. Alas, not everyone at my table enjoyed their food, so I shall proceed with the 4 star rating.

Steak was great and the restaurant was accommodating since we pushed back our reservation an hour. The rib eye was huge, (18 oz.) and I was glad with my decision to share it. I always order my steaks medium- rare and more often then not they come out on the medium side instead of the rare side. Gallagher's however, did a great job at nailing the perfect medium-rare. For sides we ordered creamed spinach, broccoli au gratin and mac n cheese. All were fantastic but if you have an aversion to bacon for whatever reason, they put it in their mac. I however, love bacon and thoroughly enjoyed it.

My friend ordered the sea bass, which was their special and it came out quite overdone. We informed the waiter and he took it back immediately, but then shortly after proceeded to tell us thats how ALL the sea bass were coming out. We found this a bit odd but she settled on some salmon and he brought her an extra side of mac to make up for it.

In conclusion, Gallagher's is a very good steakhouse. Is it the best? Likely not, but I'll have to investigate a bit further to find out.... I think Petsmart's selection is better than Petco. Clean store, great staff. On site pet clinic, grooming and obedience classes available. They sell a new puppy coupon pack for $20...includes free food, grooming, daycare, etc...makes it well worth the price. Get a Petsmart's card for greater savings. 
Close to my home too which is a bonus for me.. Dr. Bennett  got me through my pregnancy when rib and low back pain became debilitating. She's Webster certified - something any mom to be needs to demand in a chiropractor - so she knows how to handle the changing and growing pregnant body. She even has comfy pillows that allow you to lie on your belly - something you really come to miss!  

I've continued to go to her for weekly adjustments since the birth of my son. She always listens carefully to my whining and knows just the right adjustment to use to help me. She has even helped me with my TMJ and wrist problems. 

I am a chiropractic junkie, and have tried many others in the valley since moving here five years ago. Dr. Bennett is the only one to earn my trust and continually meet my needs. She will be my chiropractor for as long as we live in Phoenix!. I've been to Tempe Center for the Arts a handful of times, mostly for really fun events such as the Epik Dance Troop performance this past weekend, Ignite Phoenix, and the annual 20-30 Club Noche de Gourmet.

The facility is gorgeous.  It sits right on Tempe Town Lake.  It has ample parking, and it's pretty centrally located.  There are three levels with stairs and elevators, and plenty of restrooms as well.

Whether you're considering going to an event at Tempe Center for the Arts as a guest or thinking about hosting an event there yourself, go for it!  Just make sure I get an invite as I'd love to join you!. Pizza by the slice... always amazing and hits the spot... and the slices are huge! I can never finish a whole one. There is normally the usual cheese or pepperoni, but in addition there are some amazing interesting combinations available at a minutes notice. 

We normally pickup a slice then go to the bar ,get a yummy beer(like Moose Drool) and sit at a table and sing along with the great music videos playing! 

Perfect end to a night of adventuring around Fremont street!. When on a Sunday evening and they were pretty busy so the service was a bit slow. However it was well worth the wait. I had the curry chicken and it was phenomenal. The flavors were amazing and if I wasn't in public I would have licked the plate clean. Great place for a casual dinner with friends where you don't have a time constraint and aren't in a rush. Loved it!. You had me at outdoor bocce court. Seriously. But, the basic hamburger is great, freshly ground beef, always tender and juicy. I dig the Vings. Any time I order a double Bombay Sapphire gin and tonic, it's tasty and refreshing. The waitstaff are always helpful and kind. The environment is retro cool. The back patio is relaxing and spontaneous at the same time. Bottles of wine are half price on Sundays. Good basic stuff. But, did I mention the bocce? Crazy, man, crazy.. I do enjoy staying at SLS. We've stayed here on a couple of occasions.  This past Christmas we decided to stay in town rather than taking that long ride to San Diego. We treated ourselves to massages at their spa instead it was wonderful!! The massage is so relaxing because you can choose specific aromatherapy oils that they use on you. When the massage is over you can relax in a private room sipping on flavored teas and munching on cookies.
 This hotel has comfy accommodations.  In the room they have their mini bar labeled as saints and sinners. The saint side you will find things like candy and nuts. The sinner side is full of stuff that can help you make bad decisions lol. If working out is more your thing you can use their 24 hour gym. They have water and towels for you so there is no need to bring your own. 

It's also a treat to know that there are good restaurants to eat at so we don't have to leave. Cleo, the cafe and Unami burger are some of our favorite places to eat during our stay.. My bookclub met at King's Kitchen and we had a fabulous time! Brian our waiter was awesome and knew the wines perfectly! Everyone enjoyed their entrees. I had the salmon and spinach risotto- Delish!!! The local cheese plate is a must. And of course the banana pudding!!!!!. Had a Groupon - went there today...  It was fantastic!  

I had the Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Taco plate. Loved it!  I normally don't order rice and beans but since It was my first time visiting here, I did get them.  The beans had a nice flavor and they were moist enough to dip my chips in and eat that way.  The rice had bits of corn and cilantro and was very flavorful.  

The salsa bar was also delicious with several options to choose from, including a strawberry salsa that was very nice for the sweltering Phoenix summer day.  

I liked La Condesa so much, I bought another Groupon while eating my lunch!  :). I love Sprouts for their fresh veggies.....fresh fruit...
the variety of cheeses.....

good looking meats and fish....

and BECAUSE i Spoil myself buying their Spices by BULK!!!!!!!

Amazeballs.. Thank you to Justin Martinez for the prompt service. It would have been 5 stars but the cleanup crew left lots of dust in back. Absolutely LOVE this place. I'm always a happy camper after brunching here. Amazing omelets, and I love all of the cute furniture. This place definitely has character. Added bonus: most of their plates have fresh fruit!

I haven't had a chance to try their baked goods yet, but I'll definitely try one next time!. Love this place! Great atmosphere to relax and enjoy the good tacos and salsa and guac! The service is great and they are fast. Once i came in a bit early and I work nights so I assumed they were open however the manager served us anyway even though i felt bad. He reassured us that it's ok. This is a local favorite for sure!. I was in Madison visiting family and made two trips here on the weekend. They serve late night food and bring in a DJ around 10:30 to spin some alright stuff. Friday night was better for us as he was spinning mostly house. The dance floor gets rowdy and the place gets pretty packed at night so getting to the bar can be slow, but the cocktails are worth it. The Aviator, Sazerac, etc are all good. If you can grab a table lining the room, a waitress will stop by and serve your drinks.

With the DJ comes a fairly young undergrad crowd, so if that's your scene I recommend this place. We ducked out after a while and hopped around the square... 

They're also host to Madison's Best Bartender as voted somewhere.... Came here for Mother's Day. I called in about 3 hours before and they said I could do a call ahead, assuming they would reserve a spot for me I wasn't too sure what it was but they took my name and time down. When I got there it was PACKED and the host told me it would be an hour wait, despite my call ahead? So I just stood there and then another hostess told me it would be 30-45 min. Fine whatever I would wait, I didn't mind too much I was just confused because they even pulled up my call ahead that was at 6:30. They give me a buzzer and I wait. 

10 min. later maybe less, they call me to my table!! Amazing service. Maybe it was by luck but I was very impressed. Our server was great too we loved her! I think her name was Alison or Alina or Alysha? Something with an A. (Pretty gal, Medium length light brown hair) 

Anyways! Service was amazing. Food was good. I'd be back. nice people good food！gonna come again！！I ordered chicken curry for myself and Raman for my boyfriend. And one Thai tea, one boba milk tea. It's all good! I love the chicken curry it's the best I tasted ever. lovely place. Since I used to work here, felt I had to comment. I love this place! One of the reasons I wanted to work there while a student in Madison! 

One of the cleanest kitchens you will find anywhere. Amazing cooks, who really know how to make everything so well.... Used to have a brunch that was wonderful, I wonder if they still do? 

Food is phenomenal. I am craving it as I type.  Delicious! Please deliver to nyc? :) 

Hi to everyone who works there now, and the bossman! (forgot your name, it's been so long!) 

Shish on! 
:)
Beth. Ahh, Carson Street Deli, the crown jewel of Pittsburgh's Southside.

I work about two blocks away from The Deli (yes, it needs to be "The Deli") and rest assured, I order from here for lunch about once a week. That being said, it's the ONLY place I consistently order from. Their sandwiches are amazing, the beer selection even better. Mike, the owner, is knowledgeable and passionate about his brews as well as extremely personable and friendly. They have routine beer tastings on top of all that, though I've never had the pleasure of partaking in them. Sandwiches typically run about $7-10 and I've always been able to make them last for 2 meals (so really, I'm only spending $3.50 for lunch, right?!?!)

Pleasant and secluded patio out back - definitely worth checking out on a nice day.

Only downside is that I can't get one of their great craft brews on my lunch break. Darn!. A mile of miracle shopping!

Miracle Mile shops are part of the Planet Hollywood Casino.  It's easy to park here since the entrance is located behind the strip.  Just turn on Audrie off of Harmon Avenue.  Valet is free and they do a great job hustling to retrieve and return your car.  

They do a great job of keeping it clean with so many people visiting everyday.  The stores range from chains such as Victoria's Secret to small boutique stores and art galleries.  There are also plenty of food choices and dessert dining.  

The Axis Theater and V Theater are conveniently located here.  They host some great entertainers and shows for any age range.  

Whether you are visiting or locals, it's a fun place for entertainment, shopping and dining.. Absolutely gorgeous place.  We came back to gawk at the place again after our first night here.  We had Cosmos in honor of being in the Cosmo in Vegas.  The drink seemed to be an offbeat version of the original cocktail, but excellent nevertheless.  The ambience was great.  I'm bummed we were limited on time at this place or else I'm sure  we would've stuck around for a couple of hours before painting the town red.  I will be back!. Hmmm...I'm not really sure how to start this one. So this is definitely NOT the place to bring your vegetarian friend. Or even your vegetable-liking friend. Because serious, any veggie you find will be covered and smothered in delicious meat fat of some sort.

Onions? sure, they have them, sautéed in pork fat and slathered in butter.
Potatoes? yep, a decent amount of them as well, covered in gravy and mashed with...bacon grease? butter? I'm not entirely sure, but it's something delicious. 

Foie gras aux pommes ($26): amazing. Although I prefer my dishes a little more savory, the flavors mixed together sublimely, and the balsamic reduction paired like heaven.

Carpaccio de canard (I think around $14): also delicious. Mustard + raw duck + green onion + olive oil = nom. 

Potée du PDC ($22): dear lord. one human being should not have access to this much pork. Or to this many forms of pork. Fantastic, but seriously sweating pork for the next few days.

Tarte de boudin ($17): I ate ONE slice of the boudin that night. Not to say it wasn't good, just by this point I had OD'd on pork. We took the rest home, and it made a wonderful snack on the train the next day. The boudin itself is melt-in-your-mouth soft, and the mustard that they both bake into it and garnish it with is divine.

So glad they had beer ($5ish a pint) to wash down all the grease!. OMG the honey butter croissants!!! PERRRFECT appetizer, entree side item, and dessert.  These are.. Taylor Swift says it best... "A nightmare dressed like a daydream".  Love, Love, Love! After I ate one and stared at the remainder planning my next attack, my breakfast pizza was delivered.  The pizza was super good.  I was expecting the eggs to be cooked in the pizza, but instead they are placed on the pizza like a topping. Nevertheless, it tasted very good. Definitely enjoyed the brunch and will be brunching, lunching, or dinnering here again.. Ok so this place is not the best mall in town but I'm giving it 5* bc it's close to my home and they have all the stores u want and need. 
Today is a busy day bc everyone had the same idea as us back to school shopping. My oldest daughter starts 8th grade this year and she could care less. 
I would recommend this mall to anyone that was not to old or young. Lol and that can take care of themselves. 
One thing I have to say about the meadows mall they have one of the best new store charming Charles had opened people if u have not been to one u must go. Women and girls u will love it.. Lime Blue is a gorgeous jewellery shop, the kind of place you would come if you were buying a really, super special piece of jewellery.

Their diamond jewellery is stunning and their engagement and wedding rings are out of this world. They also have a great range of bracelets and jewellery for special birthday and to commemorate special anniversaries. 

The jewellery is gorgeous but the layout of the shop doesn't show it at it's best, I realise that it's presented the way it is because of security reasons but the whole shop feels very linear and boring when they could dot the glass cabinets about a bit and make it a bit more funky rather than just going along a line and looking at one display after another. For a jewellers, it's just a little bit boring.  

They stock Pandora which is a bit more purse friendly and even though I can't stand Pandora, I have a lot of friends who love it and have the charm bracelets so it's excellent for gifts as you can pop in and buy charms for friends and family who have charm bracelets.. This place is awesome. Great scenery to sit and hang out with close friends and family. Their drinks are to die for, and plus they are so much cheaper than Starbucks! Talk about a win-win. I always order the chai tea here and it's great. Perfect hint of sweetness. They even taste better than Starbucks as well. I wish this place was a lil closer to my house because I would be going there every single day. 
The workers are also nice, they aren't robots that are forced to talk to us about coffee. These people honestly care about how your day is going so far and they always start the discussion as well. They also give out great drinks if you haven't decided yet.. I have boarded my 2 small dogs here several times. They don't do well at Vet/Boarding places, so I appreciate the non hospital setting. 
They are a bit pricey but worth it. My top priority is safety and protection. The facility is staffed well enough that I trust mt dogs are safe and would be evacuated in case of power outage or other emergency. 
The groomers do a great job trimming nails and all other services. 
Go have a look they will give you a tour.. We come here just about every day. I have had everything from the wonderful butter burgers,the chili dogs,chicken strips,salad, and every single one of there tasty sides. You can't go wrong.. Had wanted to get out to this place for five years now and finally made it. Was worth the wait. Great atmosphere.  Margherita Pizza was amazing. Caprese salad was a bit salty, but otherwise very fresh.  Friendly service and validated our parking for the garage so it only cost $1. Will definitely be back.. Fresh, delicious and conveniently quick! I've been twice and the food/service is consistently top notch. The "Chipotle" of Greek food. We've taken our dogs to Petsmart Arcadia for toys, treats, treatments and grooming for 5 years and have always received stellar service. We've only just stumbled across our first bad grooming experience this week. After a brief phone call with manager Bobby, we were refunded for the service and are excited to continue using their services for your two dogs. It's great to feel like being a long-term customer matters, and that the health of our dogs is taken seriously. It's not the closest location to us, but we'll continue to return for Mike's well-done haircuts.. Best brunch ever! Love the banana nut muffins, yumm!. They always do a great job on my eyebrows! I never go anywhere else! Ask for Phien, she is the best! She is also very friendly!. This gym is great for the price.  I went here for a year and a half, when I moved across town I switched gyms.  The manager, Jessica, is really friendly, and the gym is never overly-crowded (unlike the LVAC up the street.)

Pros:
1.  Good hours (24 hours on weekdays, open fairly late on weekends)
2.  Large locker rooms
3.  Lots of equipment
4.  Clean
5.  Friendly staff
6.  Large stretching area
7.  Never super crowded

Cons:
1.  Machines are older (but maintained) 
2.  No classes (if that's your thing)
3.  TVs never seem to be on a "good" channel (but you can never please everyone with that.)
4.  Basics-only club (no bells and whistles - oh, but they do have tanning.  I don't use that, but I know some people do) and only one location in Vegas.


That said, you really can't beat the price.  If you live nearby, this is an awesome place to put in your daily (or weekly) workout!. As a business owner(of a salon), I have worked with several plumbers over the last 5 years. In Los Angeles I have dealt with drunk plumbers(during the day!), late arrivals(waited over 2 hrs), and flat out lies that ended up costing me way too much money. Freddy answers his phone, is polite, prompt and knowledgeable. He fixed the mess a previous plumber made and charged me a very fair price. The next time I called, he was just as helpful as before. I will be using his services from now on. It's GREAT to find a professional you can trust!!. I had their Griddle French toast with banana! It was soo good! It has a whole fried banana on top! It came with three giant French toast! It also had pecans on top. Def recommend trying these out! One of the best French toast I've ever had!  I didn't finish it all because it was so much food!!. Food was great! Had the Giana pizza, sausage, pine nuts, mushrooms. Crust is great (thanks brick oven). Kale & arugula salad with sun dried tomatoes was fresh & filling.  Great service, clean. Outside seating available.. went at 2:45pm and it was packed! pho was good and authentic. bf had the grilled chicken with rice, and it was also very good. service was "basic vietnamese" (not overly helpful or attentive, but prompt). pro: good parking, next to pure foot massage.. I was hosting a Parisian themed bridal shower and was looking for a great place for macarons in the West Valley. This place is right up the road from me and had great reviews. It is in a strip mall and can be hard to miss, but this is a great family owned place! The ladies that work there are very friendly. 

I ordered 18 macarons of 6 different flavors. They were very reasonably priced ($1.50/each) compared to other bakeries in the Phoenix Metro area.  Unfortunately I was unable to try this delicious pastries due to an allergy, but they were a hit at the shower! 

I will definitely be back next time I am hosting a shower or party.. Am I enough of a Yelper to tell you my guilty pleasures? I love Kitchen Nightmares - that reality show with the angry British chef. It's part business case study, part peek behind the scenes of restaurant glamour. I know its tough running a restaurant, but can the people on the show really not see what's wrong??!!

So why do I think of Kitchen Nightmares when I sit at the bar of Fusion on a Saturday night? Not because it's a candidate for the show, but because it's the complete and total opposite. Fusion owners Matt and JenLynn Long have the essentials of the restaurant business down: great food, great service. 

Fusion is the most humble restaurant in downtown Scottsdale. Tucked behind the too-cool-for-school W Hotel and Axis/Radius, this is the kind of neighborhood restaurant you'd expect in downtown Phoenix.

Walk in and JenLynn will greet you like an old friend - even if it's your first time. She'll help you pick out the perfect martini - a pomegranate, orange vodka blend for me that night - and make sure your entrée is just to order. A curtain separates the bar from the main dining where families and couples enjoy their meals. 

Sometimes Fusion can be a expensive - $30-40 for dinner. But it's worth it for a dinner you'll remember like a dream - not a nightmare.. My husband and I decided to make the drive to Parma last night for dinner. I was really in the mood for some fresh pasta and with their awesome reviews, we figured it had to be good. We were not disappointed! We called ahead to make a reservation and when we got there they didn't have a table, but they seated us on a couch in their lounge. The host was extremely friendly and talked to us about the menu while we waited. They also brought out bread and water, which was incredibly thoughtful.We were seated at a table a few minutes after hanging out in the lounge. 

The complimentary bread is delicious and topped with fresh parmesan cheese. They have olive oil and balsamic on the table if you would like to create a dip, which of course we did. We decided to start with the house salad and were incredibly happy that we did. It has a light oil dressing, apple strips, nuts, and a mound of fresh ricotta. The ricotta is so silky smooth and rich. Everything worked well together and the fresh pepper they added to the top really made the flavors sing. I moved on to the sausage and spinach ravioli with Sunday sauce. They were stunning! I received the perfect size portion, about 6, and cleaned my plate with a little help from my husband. The sausage flavor was prominent, but you could still taste the spinach, cheese, and incredible sauce. My husband had the pappardelle bolognese and it did not disappoint. The meat sauce was delicious and there were carrots and peas mixed in as well. The pasta was delicate but cooked to a perfect al dente so it didn't fall apart. 

Not only was the food amazing, but the service was great too. We really felt like we were part of the family. I also love that they have a deli counter with all sorts of Italian delights. In addition, they sell their fresh pastas and sauces so you can make a delicious dinner very easily at home. A restaurant serving this caliper of food could easily be stuffy and formal, but the lounge and deli counter really bring it back down to earth. I also love that they change their menu almost nightly, it makes it easy to try all sorts of new dishes. We will definitely be back!. Sushi was amazing and service was top notch. Allison was our waitress and super professional and helpful. forgot his name but Philippino guy was super nice too!. The first I even went here was for my birthday in Nov. It was actually a first for my entire party.  Me and my BFFs pretty much have made this place our spot for girls night out!  Food is great! Staff is friendly! Oh and the bathroom is awesome! lol!. Where do I begin? I no longer eat wheat but I'll make an exception for this place. 

Their bread selection is excellent, and it's always fresh. My personal favorite is the sourdough walnut bread. It's purple but don't let that throw you off. I also love their skinny cheese baguettes. After you've taken a bite, you won't want to share - and I don't blame you. They're delicious!

They offer a variety of freshly made sandwiches - the chicken salad is excellent but then, everything is good there. 

Their desserts are, in my opinion, masterpieces. Not only are they positively fabulous in taste, but they look great. I mean, I sometimes look at their cakes or pastries and it pains me to demolish them - they're just so pretty. 

Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything that you buy here, or in any other Premiere Moisson. They offer freshness and quality, in addition to a wonderful selection of delectable items. Yummo. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 is because they can be a little on the pricey side, but in my opinion, they're well worth it.. I got stuck overnight in Charlotte and was placed here on a voucher from the airline. As a 20-something girl traveling solo at the time I was really afraid that this place would be sketchy, because I've had horrible luck in the same situation in Atlanta in the past. This hotel is extremely nice, clean, and up to date. The treadmills in their fitness center are awesome! The hotel staff was extremely nice and accommodating. The hotel restaurant was pretty good too. All in all a fantastic experience!. Knaller! Der Laden ist der Hammer, Grill Lounge auf höchstem Niveau! Bester Burger ever, alle Gerichte sind auf einem Level zubereitet, welches dem Sternekoch gerecht wird! Klare Empfehlung für alle, die gute Burger und Sandwiches lieben! Preise dafür moderat, die Qualität ist exzellent.. Fabulous experience, my photos turned out perfect. The quality was amazing. I'll be returning for all my future printing needs.. This Zoo is very fun, and they seem to be adding things or redoing things in the last few years. We really like the petting zoo, as my kids like the hands on stuff. We usually just go for a few hours and then come home to eat meals/take naps. I'd say we go a couple times a year, so our Pogo Passes work perfect, as they get us in twice for free. Two adult tickets cost $40, and with a pogo pass costing $40, it pays for itself and then the rest of the stuff is free. If you haven't checked out Pogo Pass do it! Use promo code TAKE60OFF and get into the Phoenix Zoo for free twice a year~!. Looking for a place to kick back and have great bar food? This would be the place to go. 

With picnic tables set up and a place to walk up order food and beverage you can't go wrong with throwing on comfy clothes and hanging out. 

I had a burger with sautéed onions and green peppers and some tots. The burger was the perfect size and delicious and the tots were as good as tots get. I was a little bummed they were out of a few things when I went but I still had a good experience and enjoyed the atmosphere greatly. They are quick to clean up your mess which is helpful. Hope I can make it here when I'm in Charlotte again.. We loved our food. Very fresh like they said. Great fast food. Great place to eat at Circus Circus! Love to come again.. so i went in the afternoon and at night...both times there was a wait so we ended up ordering to go...seating is available outdoors and in but the tables outside r dirty & cheap...the FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE however is totally worth the wait!!! it taste just like it sounds!!! def worth the trip there...good portions too...shud be shared!. We got the Bayou Bites & they were really good.. Definitely impressed by the quality of the chicken!! They don't come tossed yet but we did try their different sauces, The Sweet Heat is a sweet chili perfectly made, The Bomb which is Hot, Mango Habanero, & The Voodoo which has some gentle heat!! All the sauces were good & the ranch was also well made!!! Owner was really cool too!!! Definitely going back!!!. I have had the pleasure of using Airline Shuttle, on several occassions, and on a couple of occassions I was fortunate enough to have the same driver. On 4-7 2015, I had my parents with me and my mother was on a cane, very unstable,  after hip replacement. A passenger, trying to force his way in line knocked her almost off her feet, NO ONE SAW IT COMING, but the driver, she was able to grab my mom, and kept her from falling. 
The driver then personally escorted my mom, on to the bus, and asked a gentleman if he would mind exchanging seats so she  didn't have to walk to the back. 
This was above and beyond, and I so appreciated her efforts. I wish I had gotten her name, but her bus number was 1822.
Would recommend this company, highly. 
I own my business, and employee's like this is what makes a difference. I was freaking out because I wasn't able to do my nails in Miami before flying to Phoenix for my best friend's wedding. Pretty little nails was close to my hotel and decided to give it a try...and I'm so glad I did. My manicure was impeccable and my pedi tire was not just perfect but that massage...LOVE!!!! I definitely recommend this place. If I'm ever in Arizona again...I'm stopping by. Staff is friendly and sweet!. Looooooved this hotel. Amazingly historic and charming, my husband treated me to a weekend here. With the exception of the fitness room (which was super sad, to say the least... one elliptical, one treadmill, a few weights, super small, and cobwebby in the corners), the place just feels expansive and luxurious. The beds are super soft and the bathrooms are nicely updated. 

The hotel has almost a B&B feel, but obviously, given the fact that it spans two mansions, it's bigger. The staff is kind and helpful, and, although we didn't partake in the brunch, we have heard it's awesome. Next time I am in Pittsburgh, I will definitely stay here again, especially since I love the neighborhood. I will just make it a point to run outside instead of hitting up their sad little fitness room. If they just fix that, this place will get 5 stars from me every time.. I dinned here for the frozen hot chocolate, I was intrigued on how this would taste and was pleasantly surprised at how yummy this really was. It was not overly sweet and tasted like hot chocolate frozen. The decor is nice and the restaurant is clean. My husband ordered the club sandwich, it tasted fresh like the meat was just sliced and the portion was the right size for the price. I ordered the taco salad, it came out neat with taqitos sticking out. The taco salad was good, not the best ive had but good. The staff was friendly and attentive which sets the tone for my meals, I am big on customer service and feel other than the quality of food the type of service is what is going to aid into weather i would go again. This is defiantly a place i would go back to, not sure if i would order the taco salad again, but there is other stuff on the menu id like to try.. Amazing, amazing, amazing!  I had their special black bean pizza and it blew me away!  Everything on the menu sounded so good!  I'll have to go back to try many more items:). This review is based off everything about the company since I used to work there. I've worked for a corporate location and one franchises. This is the franchised location I worked at. Delete if this isn't allowed but here's my opinion. 

Knowing about how fresh everything is makes it better for me. I know what I'm eating and he quality. I still go here all the time. I always get the best service, always the best sandwiches (my favorite is the Cran Slam Club on a roll with extra mayo or an Italian with extra mayo, no tomatoes, American instead of provolone, black olives, pickles, and vinegar.) this is one amazing company and I hope one day when I'm visiting Manhattan I can walk down the street and see this store on every corner. Thank you Capriotti's for treating me right as a former employee and now a capaddict! Stay as amazing as you are!. Super cute stop. The flying avocado wrap was excellent along with the cranberry  pomegranate  lemonade. Customer service awesome.. Love this office!  Dr. listens and gives appropriate time to my treatment & care. I never feel rushed. I've been coming to this location since it opened. I usually don't have to wait but a few minutes if that, meaning 10 minutes. (Just sit back and read the US magazine and get caught up with the entertainment world while you wait. ha)  Friendly staff. I'm personally on maintenance so receptionist always describes package options very clearly. Something for everyone.. Wow wow wow!

Recently came here with a group celebrating some special visitors in town. Absolutely remarkable service. Our table was in a small room to the right of the main dining room and overlooked the Bellagio fountains. The view was gorgeous.

The owner of Circo, Mario, sent us over a bottle of prosecco and it was a wonderful apertif to start our meal.

Two people in our group opted for the prix fix menu (I believe it was $85/person) and that contained five courses.

The remainder of our table ordered off the regular menu:

-caprese salad
-dozen oysters (delicious!)
-duck panzotti (little triangle raviolis)
-mushroom risotto
-lamb chop
-filet mignon
-sea bass (one of the specials for the evening)
-pappardelle with sausage (my selection, yummmo)

Everyone loved the food. We also had several bottles of chianti. It paired wonderfully.

To end the meal, Mario sent over a selection of desserts:

-tiramisu (my favorite of all the desserts)
-creme brulee
-pannacotta
-pineapple mango souffle
-assorted fruits

Dinner took us around 3.5 hours. It was leisurely, enjoyable and delicious. I will definitely come back to Circo for a special dinner out and of course thank you to Mario for making our evening so special!. Nice service.  Has all the LGO faves.  Definitely a new fave for when I travel and thank goodness it's located in the SWA terminal!. Let's start with 30 great beers on tap. The list constantly changes to keep things fresh and let us not forget another 200 beers in bottles and can! Holy mama! This is the best beer selection in Scottsdale hands down! The atmosphere is comfortable and a little dive baresque but in a good way.. Knowledgeable staff, good pub food round out this unique little diamond In the rough.. Me and my husband always decide to go here whenever we have a meat craving ( I'm not really a red meat kind of gal ). So we came here for my birthday! It was definitely worth it, for dinner it's around $50 a person, and people come around slicing meat for you. I have to say the service was really great on my birthday, I don't know if it was because on my open table reservation I mentioned it was my birthday or - they just love giving great service! My server was dead on with service, when he noticed my mother in law didn't have a plate for her meats, he grabbed her one, and water cups were never empty. Our server also asked if we had any meat requests, and sent them over right away. Of course I have to mention their salad bar, if you don't want too much meat - this is the place to hit up. There are assortment of things, sauces for your meat, and one of my favorites - their lobster bisque soup. Last but not least for dessert I got a birthday cheesecake, and my server put a candle on it! It was a nice dinner for my birthday, very pleased. :-). If you can tell from my previous reviews, I prefer not having to drive very far for delectable eats. 
This place sits in a plaza that's nearby the local shopping centers and has ample parking. I ordered the Miso with nori and egg. It was a bit on the salty side, but delicious still. I was looking for a spicy miso option, but none was available. :(

I also ordered the cha shu bun and that was delicious since it was like a slider with the lettuce and sauce. 

Great service and everyone was always smiling.. And yes, they do fill up any other growlers w/one of their brews of course, and that's only if your pick's in stock; their best IPA was & will be for another 2+ weeks, TAPPED!. Chocolate covered macaroons, oh my.  I think I died and went to macaroon heaven.

And yes, the biscotti is delicious, too.

They close at 3 p.m., so you'd better get your sweet fix on early.  But the aroma alone is worth it.. Definitely a fun place when you're hungover and need a place to get you ready for round 3 or 4.. 

They have a bloody mary that is served with a mini slider... super delicious.  The slider is perfect. They also have a tasty mini pastrami which is equally great. The fires are right on. 

Its fun. 
Its easy. 
Its tasty.. Great nail salon. Quality work and clean facility. I'm a regular and see Peter religiously every 2 weeks. He's the best!  But, all the gals do equally awesome work. 

The salon is busy, so make an appointment at least two weeks (especially for Peter) in advance if you can.. Last night I was part of a group of 15  that gathered on the patio at 5 & diner to enjoy the good food  and the beautiful weather.

As usual the service was outstanding and the friendly staff went out of their way to show they appreciated our business.

Looking for a place that serves breakfast any time of the day or  night?  You've found a home here.

This is excellent, low cost, traditional diner food.  I love the type of music that is always playing in the background.  This is one of the few places to eat on the patio where you are far enough away from the street.. My husband and I made last minute reservations here for dinner after a show on Saturday night and we are so glad we did. The restaurant was busy when we arrived at 9pm, but we were sat right away. This restaurant offers beautiful views of the Bellagio fountain, so it was nice to watch the show go off every 15 mins or so.

Our waitress was accommodating and friendly, and took the time to go through things on the menu we weren't quite sure about. We ordered the Tuscan Farmhouse flatbread, it had shaved ham, mozzarella, asparagus and caramelized onion. It was very good, the bread had a nice consistency, doughy but crisp. My husband ordered the special, spaghetti and meatballs in a cream sauce. He said it was good, but the cream sauce lacked in flavor. I ordered the beef tenderloin, it came as a perfect medium. It had a nice crust to it, and was like butter when cut. The mashed potatoes were nice, as well as the tempura asparagus. We also chose to get the zucchini sticks, and so glad we did. They were seriously one of the tastiest things I ate our whole trip. 

The service here was amazing, and super attentive. Drinks were topped off frequently, and I'm pretty sure it would be impossible to finish a water without someone refilling it. Food was served quickly as well, we spent less than an hour here, but never once felt rushed. We will definitely return here when we come back to Vegas !. I am so glad that I waited to write this review.  When I first visited Seamus I awed by the cozy at home feel that this place gave you. The drinks were typical for a bar and occasionally there was live music. I thought it was a fun place to visit. The decor is typical fun for an Irish pub, love the troll and leprechaun dolls in the showcase.

Now that I visit here more often I am in love with this bar.  Brandon is an amazing bartender.  I love going here in Sunday's to enjoy the most amazingly delicious chicken pot pie in town while enjoying the best playlist provided by Randal. 

Go for the drinks, go for the food, and go for the fun. Definitely just go to Seamus.. Love this place for some decent Thai! Shrimp & Chicken Pad Thai is always good and never disappoints, the soups are great, I also really like their Beef Panang. Their desserts always sound good and they usually have something that involves mango, how I have escaped never trying one is beyond me. Their over all menu is a bit limited and is kept to the basics but what they do have is done well.. I love this place! I come here daily. The salads are huge for what you pay and they use local produce. The food is amazing and you can tell it's so fresh. A must come to place. I am currently in love with the Santa Fe salad. Fresh Jicama and the salad dressing is like crack. Now let me rave about my customer experience here. I was in a rush to work and left my wallet by my computer after a late night of online shopping. I was pulling up to the window when I realized I didn't have it. I asked the worker to Cancel it and explained I didn't have my wallet. She said it happens and not to worry. She then gave me a copy of my receipt and said I could pay it back later. I was completely shocked. Of course, I made sure to come back and cover my lunch from the day before but just that small act of customer service done right has made me a loyal customer. It has also become a reminder to make sure I have my wallet at all times.. I am VERY spoiled when it comes to salads-I eat them all the time and make my own homemade dressings. Radish did not disappoint! The salads were delicious, unique, and a satisfying meal! And the staff was very friendly!. Something about the corn tortillas at Pink Taco has me hooked! There is someone making them fresh in the front of the Restaurant and it always makes me so hungry watching them! 

When I eat here, I order the three small corn tortilla chicken tacos with cheese, and a chipotle chicken tamale. The tamales are to die for and I CRAVE them from time to time! 
The chips and salsa are also really yummy. 

Sometimes the service is a little slow when it's not busy, and we had to ask for silverware last time. But that's understandable from time to time as long as the food is delicious. We also came in with a stroller and the hostess tried seating us at t high top table, which I assumed since she was a younger girl she didn't understand that we would need a regular table and chairs. 

We will certainly come back!. We were in Vegas to celebrate our 10th anniversary and found Sheridan's thru Yelp.  Stopped by after dinner and we were so glad we did.  I had the grasshopper which was mint flavored frozen custard with melted chocolate whipped together.  What's great was that the chocolate freezes once it hits the custard and the whipping action created nice little chocolate flakes.  I loved it!  Reminded me of the Thrifty's mint and chip ice cream that I loved so much as a kid.  My husband had one with salted pecans, caramel, and chunks of mango.  Sweet and savory.  I didn't care for his too much, but he really liked it.  If you've never had frozen custard, it's similar to soft serve, but it has a slight egg taste to it.... like a custard!  Duh!   Anyway, it was a great after dinner dessert, esp when in Vegas during the scorching hot summer!. Nachos are so bomb! I ordered it without sour cream & added chicken. Ingredients tasted so fresh & I'm going back for more.. This quaint little gem is located inside the Galleria downstairs from where I attended classes.  I always got a fruit salad (had lots of red grapes, strawberries, pineapples, no cantaloupe or honeydew YAY!) and either a latte or mocha.  They we nice and worked quickly and they even remembered my name after a few visits, which I think is rather rad, considering how many people come by everyday.  They offer breakfast and lunch items, they have coffees/espresso/teas, power bars, pastries, and the like.  I wish I could say that I will be back, but I'm done with school and it's quite out of the way.  It was great while it lasted, thanks for the great service peeps!. Probably the COOLEST airport because you can drink anywhere! You don't have to stay in the lame bar area. Plus you can gamble while you wait for your flight. Hope there's no delay! HA.

But the people here do seem kind of rude. Is it just me or is everyone at the airport kind of rude? Eh.. Decided to try this place out after hearing how great it is from both the reviews on here and from word of mouth. It is an awesome little hangout spot with a great selection of wine and beer and you can't go wrong with any food consisting of bread, brie, prosciutto, figs and the like.  The valet parking and the Range Rovers out front made me nervous for the clientele that comes here (as my boyfriend and I pull up in my Kia) but I have never had such excellent service.  In fact when we walked in we were slightly overwhelmed and didn't quite know who to talk to about a table when the hostess walks up to us and asks if we needed help and my boyfriend blurted out "we don't know what we're doing!" and without even smirking she said she'd take our name for our table of 4 and then come find us when one was available, in the mean time we could get a drink and wait at the cocktail tables. Not 30 seconds from when we walked over to the table another waiter walked up to us and asked if we needed a drink and showed us the drink menu. All this at 6:30pm on an already busy Friday night! About 15 minutes pass, our friends show up, we have our drinks and then a section of the bar opens up at the end that nobody else has taken so another waitress/hostess/whatever asks us "are you a table of 4? would you like to sit here?" We aren't fussy so we just sit and here we are the rest of the night. My friend even got a free Fish Head (Dogfish?) beer for just being right there when they accidentally poured the wrong one for another patron. I'll definitely have to check this out again on one of the happy hour nights, our waiter got me with the "Bruschetta Board and bottle of wine for $20 on Tuesday nights"!. Delicious, yummy food, great veggie options, decent wine and beer list, great prices, and incredible service are all the ingredients for a successful establishment! Rich chatted us up while we were there, he was one of the funniest, most attentive bar owners I have ever met.  I will definitely go back and my family absolutely enjoyed the experience.  Would be a great place to go with some girlfriends for a wine tasting or with a crowd to watch a football game.. Enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Had the chicken larb, chow mein, fresh shrimp spring rolls, and spicy fried rice. All of the dishes were very tasty, not overly sauced, and fresh. Would definitely recommend trying them out. When in the parking lot keep your eyes open otherwise you'll pass their store front!. went there today and my dining companions ordered tofu banh mi, off the menu. they said it was delicious. note -- they don't have banh mi on the menu, but they'll make it -- I and dining companions have ordered banh mi with grilled pork, cold cuts & pate, and tofu. about $4-$5, and it's pretty good!. The food is great.  Lots of unique choices and wonderful desserts.  The atmosphere is rather dark, but quaint.  Will definitely be back next time I am in town. Carne Adovado for sure!!!. My boyfriend and I visit Vegas fairly often and usually we skip the buffets.  This time, we were in the mood to try one we've never eaten at for dinner. We went to Wicked Spoon for Friday dinner. It was only $26.99 (we loved it already!)

When we got there, we were amazed at the individual portions.  Everything looked so good.  So, we decided to first check out everything before we started shoving food onto our plates.  We were literally running around oohing and aahing.  We were like 2 kids (grown adults) in a candy store.

The Asian food was surprisingly good!  The fried rice is usually overlooked, but it's really good.  So are their rolls and dim sum.

The ricotta spinach was also something that was really good.  It's creamy, but also light.

The consistency of their mashed potatoes were the best!  The Korean need salad was tasty and super refreshing.  They even had crab claws that were already cracked.  The shrimp cocktail had the shrimp completely peeled and defined.  (Prefect for lazy people like me!)

I don't eat lamb, but my boyfriend really enjoyed it with the chimichurri sauce.  The mac n cheese bar was amazing!  My boyfriend also loved the goat cheese mac n cheese.

The dessert was impressive.  They even had desserts served in real painted eggshells.  Very creative.  The chocolate covered apples were my favorite!

Oh!  And the service was impeccable!  Everyone was really nice and helpful.. This place has been updated and seems a bit smaller and make sure you call in an order ahead of time because they are BUSY during lunch.  For good reason though, this place is amazing.  Affordable and consistently good quality food makes this place choice for lunch or dinner.  If you like traditional americanized chinese dishes, orange chicken or beef and mongolian beef are a wonderful choice.  The fried rice is incredible.  However, if you are looking for something more exotic I cannot recommend enough that you try the curry laksa.  It is delicious.  I am so glad this place exists.. FINALLY made it to Bouillon Bilk! It's been on my list for a very, very long time and the hype was definitely worth it.  

First off, a 5:30pm reservation is definitely where it's at. The restaurant opens exactly at 5:30 and you will be one of the first tables seated. Within minutes, the rest of the place will be packed with all the other smart cookies who had the same plan as you. That way you don't have to deal with too much of a backlog in the kitchen as you would if you were the second seating in the evening. You even get the added bonus of dealing with extra-friendly staff at the beginning of service.

In terms of decor, the crisp white tablecloths and the sparkling wine glasses are the first things you notice when you walk in the door. In the middle of the dining room, the wooden bartop is attention-grabbing (Note to self: Ask to sit at the bar next time... Just gorgeous!). 

For service, the staff is VERY attentive and as another reviewer pointed out, they are absolute experts on the menu. The waitress and chef were very accommodating for the dairy and nut allergies at our table. 

Now, onto the foooooood: 

Lamb tartar - This was my first time trying lamb tartar and now I'm a big fan. The combination of the smoky cabbage, crispy topping and some sort of stonefruit all on top of the lamb was just unreal. 

Beef duo - Special of the night. Grilled strip loin ("Melt-in-your-mouth") with braised beef cheeks (Super tender), veggies, mushroom and gnochhi (Original dish has butter, parmesan and sweet potato puree as well).

Lobster cappelleti - Rich and indulgent, in the best way possible. The mascarpone and cream filling was soooo savoury and satisfying. Big chunks of lobster on top. Crispy fried bits and some plainer green veggies on the side... I was literally tasting perfection. 

Chocolate ganache - With sour cream ice cream and lemon cream. I was warned by previous reviews that dessert is not Bouillon Bilk's strong point. I agree that it was average but there is nothing bad about the standard chocolate ganache. 

To explain my four-star rating... We both agreed (like other reviewers) that a five-star rating would be granted with slightly larger portion sizes. Even after having three full courses, we were not that full. Yes, the flavours, service and decor are top notch but just a little bit more food on their plates would be ideal!. I pretty much had a good time the two times I went here. My favorite are their salmon dishes. Anything on their menu with salmon in it is a definite favorite. I don't know why we can only order ONE dessert out of the AYCE menu though...

The only thing that bothered me was the service. It was the slowest I've ever had, ever. (And I've been to a lot of places, not just in Vegas). If they fix their slow service, this place could definitely become my favorite place for AYCE sushi.. Amazing!
Great atmosphere. 
Great beer selection. 
great food. 
Great beer!
Wish I lived closer!. My family and I went to dinner here tonight after years of feeling in-between about it. We used to come here late 90's, we really liked it but forgot about the little authentic Italian place for a while.

We went there tonight to celebrate my moms birthday, our server was Krista. She was awesome, she was around asking for drink refills, how everything was, but not too much that it was annoying. We really appreciated that, ask for her! 

The atmosphere was nice, it started getting busy around dinner time but it wasn't loud at all. We were able to talk and have a good time without having to yell across the table. 

As far as the food, we ordered some apps, pizza, lasagna and a few other pasta dishes and almost everything was delicious. The home made lasagna was my favorite! It was so hot and cheesy, perfection! The pizza wasn't the best, it could have been cooked a little longer. 

The tab came to just under $100 which, at first, seems high but we had 2 apps, 4 entrees, a few beers and a piece of tiramisu. 

Loving this place more and more!

PS. Try the wedding soup!. There are a few things you should know before reading this review: 1. My family is fanatical about milkshakes. 2. My brother lives in Charlotte. And 3. Because of the aforementioned, during a recent family visit, he took us to Bad Daddy's for lunch.

So the most important thing to take away from this review? The milkshake was excellent. I had Cookies and Cream (or "Oreo," if you prefer) and even without whipped cream and a cherry, it knocked my socks off.  They also offer "adult" milkshakes, all of which sounded wonderful. Being a family affair on a Saturday afternoon I did not partake, and so I cannot fully attest to their awesomeness, but how can you really go wrong with alcohol AND a milkshake?? 

My boyfriend and I split the Cantina Burger (black bean burger with green chiles, avocado and cheese) and the Western Burger (bison burger, Monterey Jack, fried onions and BBQ), and both were excellent. Likewise, we split the sweet potato fries and the fried onions - again, both excellent. Furthermore, my family split an appetizer of fried pickles (yum), and I stole some of my Dad's Truffle Parmesan fries (super yum).  

AND! You can make your own burger or your own salad. There were so many delicious options on the menu that I didn't do this, although I love to "build my own" so it was hard to pass up. 

It was expensive - my Dad didn't have an entree, only two of us had a soda and we split a few of the milkshakes, and the bill was still $100 plus for 6 people. Ok, so now that I'm doing the math that's +/-$16 per person, so it's not outrageous. Oh, and the wait staff were excellent. Accommodating, pleasant, efficient.  It was a late lunch on a Saturday and the restaurant was not overly crowded - a little loud inside, but we ate outside and it was very pleasant. Ultimately, I would love to go back next time we're in the area.. If ever a place had our name written on it, it would be this one.  I would like to try pretty much everything on the menu!  In between shows at the Blumenthal on Sunday night we were looking for a quick bite, and this fit the bill perfectly.

  Sadly, neither of us were feeling well, so we couldn't do this wonderful place justice...wah!  As a result, I went very basic by ordering the Elvis.  Husband went with the Bruiser.

  We both loved our burgers.  Mine was perfectly cooked to the medium well I requested.  Husband's was perfectly done and very tasty also.  Both of us got the sweet potato tots, which were more like donuts since they are glazed with sugar.  These are rich and very sweet.  Dessert for this gal.

  Shamefully, we had to forego the lovely alcohol opportunities that otherwise we would have taken full advantage of...what a crappy time for us to not be at our best!

  This is very much our kinda place, and we will definitely go back next time we're in town!. I like the lunch buffet. The naan and paneer butter curry is delicious so are the biryani and chicken curry.Appetizers are good too. The lunch buffet is worth every penny specially for good eaters . They have stopped dosa as part of the buffet which is sad cuz it was one of my husbands favorites. Nonetheless the buffet is delicious and I am definitely going back again!. Excellent all around!

The only bad thing I have to say about this place, is it is quite large.  I felt like I was in Vegas with the amount of walking we had to do just to get from our room to the lobby!  And the weekend we were there- it was impossible to find a spot at one of the main pools were there weren't 100 kids splashing around (or a pool chair).  Luckily, we found a small pool that was another footbool field on the other side of the building:)

The service was absolutely top-notch, and the facilities were exceptional.  I highly recommend!. I came here to celebrate my birthday (party of 15). When I made the reservation I was told they only have two times of the day and they were inside ( 11am and 6pm). I was not that crazy about being inside, as all the action is in the yard. I made the reservation and soon after we arrived on Sat evening Will advised he could move our entire party outside..woohoo! That made my day! From there on out the rest of the evening was great! The food, drinks and the service was great and we look forward to returning again!. Fancy restaurant, with a novel idea. I enjoyed seeing the sunset with my friends during a birthday party. The prickly pear margarita was delicious, but I wouldn't have been able to afford more than one or two! I got the chicken flatbread appetizer as an entree and it was much bigger than any of my friends' entrees. I thorougly enjoyed it: large chunks of cheese and chicken, very flavorful, and enough for two full meals. Can't beat that!. Good location. Like that they have two fields.. Good place to stop and eat. It was busy on a holiday weekend. Quaint and cozy. Only 1 comment, you have to ask for cheese on your omlette...it doesn't come with it. I think that's odd. I saw it on the menu, but didn't bother asking.. so yelpers, ask for cheese!. This resturant is part of the Ranch Market that it is attached too.  I have been wanting to dine here for sometime, and finally got a chance to roll in and dine here.

For starters, this is as authentic as it gets.  There is a courtyard area with outdoor seating and shopping.  Colorful, traditional hispanic/latino/mexican culture shows here, and you feel like you've been taken to another country when you walk in.  Colorful is an understatement.  rich deep colors run through this location, along with beautiful traditions of hispanic culure cannot help but to seep into your bloodstream.

In the courtyard area, there is a grill that the staff cooks on.  Women are in traditional hispanic clothing, and look beautiful while they cook.  So much fun to watch, as they make tortillas, chicken, etc and be taken in by the action at the grill.

As you enter the location, you are greeted by the hostess, and taken to your seat.  Beautifully decorated dining area, with a bar area, solid wood seating for parties of any size.  Servers are all dressed again in the traditonal latino dresses, and while I was there on a Saturday night , there was also a mariachi type band playing.

They have a good selection of food, from Enchiladas, burritos and fajitas to mararitas and salsa.

I ordered the shredded beef burrito.  The serving was ginormous, and HOT when the food came out.  Even though we were seated immediately, there was two large parties dining ahead of us, so we had somewhat of a wait for our food to arrive.  Thats okay, because we were so entertained with the mariachi band, it passed by quickly. 

The food was delicious!  Portions were huge, and I took home enough leftovers for a full meal the next day.  you will NOT go hungry while dining here, and the atmosphere is contagous.  You cannot help but to get caught up in the moment, with the beautiful colors, music, and lively atmosphere at this place.  

I reccomend this place for everyone, as i think its one of the more "one of a kind" establishments in this town.  You cannot help but to have a good time while eating here.  An amazing place for locals and visitors alike.. Great place. Chips are served with a delicious bean dip, salsa and grilled veggies. My Margarita was a perfect compliment :) We ate in the bar which is a perfect spot to catch a game.  Fantastic service, flavor and atmosphere.. Awesome place.  Cheap used records, books, and CDs as well as new records and concert tickets.  Cool place to just browse for a while.  Music lovers need to check it out.. Absolutely amazing, kind staff, great macaroons and a must try pistachio latte. Love it here!. Enjoyed The Fig Tree for valentines Day with 2 other couples. Food was very good, service was outstanding.  Server was very knowledgable about both food and wine. Atmosphere is quiet and cozy. Can't wait to return. We LOVE our new patio cover!!!  Matt came out to give us a estimate and really took the time to walk us through our options.  We had certain things in our minds we wanted to do but we are sooooooo thankful that we listened to his expert advice.  We had a few bumps in the road (our issues) and they were so patient while we worked through some red tape with the county.  When it finally came to the install the guys showed up on the dot for the gutters and they were done in less than 1 hour and they look amazing!!!  Then day 2, Charlie and his guy again arrive exactly on time.  They were awesome!  Charlie so good and meticulous!  I think he was harder on himself getting everything lined up than we would have been he was just like Matt asked us about a few things and gave his suggestion and again so glad we listened to them. 

We are so happy with everything they did from start to finish.  We will def. call them when we are ready to have the gutters put on other areas around the house, landscaping, a track shade for the patio cover or anything else we need, they are the company to go to!!!  

If you are considering a patio cover I def. say go for it and call proficient patios!  I would will recommend them to anyone who needs anything!!!!. I am so torn - I want to get the word out but then again, I want this all to myself.  This place is right out of the movies, complete with soft (operative word here is soft) Italian music, mood lighting, crisp clean tables and everyone in their own private dining world - ahhh! Food is impeccable - we ordered our food spicy and it was not over done with the spice.  Perfect!  Waitress (Victoria) was unobtrusive but there when we needed her.  Perfect first date nite - after thirty years of date night - even better!. Santana is amazing!  Such a comfortable, yet beautiful environment, much having to do to his own style and personality.  He took his time, went out of his way and I left feeling awesome.  Best highlights and blowout I've ever had.. A great place to walk around,  get information or watch videos on history of Mormon church.  Safe,  Beautiful and peaceful and for all faiths there is a visitors center and a large statute of Christ!. One of my favorite places to catch the latest flick.  It has lots of food/drink options all around, yet because it's not mall you won't find tons of kids, tween and teens running all over the place all of the time.  Most kids who are there are there to watch a particular movie.  In and out of there.  

It's also just a perfect meet spot for folks from different parts of town.  It was almost equal distance for friends from N. Phx, Old town Scottsdale, North Tempe and me in SoMo.  With it's location, you know it has to keep things nice, and it always does.

And as a note, something about the place must work to help keep kids calm.  We took a pack of kids (Ok, 3 boys) here to see the first Harry Potter when it came out.  It was awesome.  Got everyone a Starbucks to sip on while waiting in the long line - even though we'd pre bought our tickets we had to get there early to ensure good seats.  And even after an early morning drive that could have made them whiny and a Venti serving of sugar and caffeine - they all behaved perfectly through the entire thing - as did almost all other kids during the whole Harry process.  Dang impressive.. Loved the food, service and clean environment!  My grandma and I eat out every Tuesday night and she had coupons for a place called, "Culver's".  It had burgers so I was game.  We had double cheeseburgers, fries and drinks.  She also got the cement shakes, or whatever they were called and loved them.  The burger was really tasty and the fries were nice and hot!  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  It had a large, clean dinning area and seemed to be family friendly. They also had TVs for the guys!  I have already told several friends about this place and I only had it last night for the first time! I say that would warrent a "woohoo"!. Missing star for all those paper bags that go useless into the trash. Can't they think of less paper and other kind of water cups?

I've tried it 3 times, and for me it would be great if they had also multigrain or brown baguettes. Other than that...service is really nice, flavors are fresh and they have good mix of ingredients.. this restuarant is a well-kept secret. the food is great -- try the vegetable medley -- and the staff is excellent. it's almost always deserted during dinner, so it's like having an entire restaurant to yourself. 

the best part. if you have an entertainment book, your meals are always 2-for-1 (expect on holidays). they never punch your diner's card, so you can use it as many times as you want. i'm talking about a prime rib dinner for two people for less than $20.. This is a beautiful theater. Just went and heard David Doubilet and Jennifer Hayes speak about underwater photography and there can't be a bad seat in the house! I could see and hear everything perfectly despite being in the upper left hand corner off to the side. Great talk, great theater and the people who work here are so nice and helpful. Two thumbs up!. Great service! Fast and friendly the girl at the front desk was very nice and helpful. I stayed here after attending a convention in the hotels ballroom. The rooms were great, and the staff was very welcoming. The only problem I had was with parking. There is a fee for parking, and upon arrival the lot was full. I was told by the attendant I wound need to find parking across the street. I went to the check in desk while my husband waited in the car, I was not happy with having to find my own parking, or being made aware that this would be a possible issue. The check in agent was great, and explained that what the parking attendant meant was I would need to go to their overflow lot. She was very apologetic that this had not been explained properly, and offered me complementary valet parking which was much appreciated. I would not hesitate to stay here again.. Love this salon!  It's open and has an upscale urban feel.  I have been going to Shelley Gregory for about 7 years now, and I cannot speak highly enough about her!  She is always patient and listens to exactly what you want done, yet will also offer suggestions if you need them.  She's also honest and will let you know if what you want is a bad idea and won't work for your hair type or even your personality once she gets to know you.  I've referred several clients to her and they've all been just as pleased!. The bread basket is awesome. I love the prime rib. Flavorful and cooked perfectly. It can expensive so I try to go when there is a buy one get one free. I like the mrkt salad and the nut salad.. What a dinner was out of this world!

The service was great the ambiance was classic/modern. 

Started with the grilled octopus, lobster mac & cheese. I usually don't like octopus but this was the best I ever had! The Sea Bass was to die for. 

I had NO room for dessert. I will definitely be back again!. You don't disappoint me at all. Everything here is super nice. Thank you Mandalay Bay for the best 4 nights ever.. SOOOOOO DELICIOUS!!!!!! I love love love how affordable it is too! Ordered two pounds of crawfish, one order fried shrimp, cajun fries and fried catfish, all for four people, and it was definitely enough. I'm not sure if that's because I drank so much water that I became full. However, I love their sauce, you MUST go for their specialty! Really good asian blend of spices mixed with new orleans yummyness. I do have to admit that maybe about 10+ crawfishes in my tongue and mouth started to burn, but that wasn't going to make me stop eating!

Ok i have to admit that the crawfishes are a bit tiny, but the best part of it all is that you're suppose to suck it all. Not just eat the meat, but the brains/roes. For real! The corn was delicious after it absorbed all the flavor and it was so juicy!

Fried shrimp great, so was the catfish. I'm not sure what batter they use, but it's amazing. Nice and crusty and oh sooo full of flavor! I like how the shrimp was butterflied open, and the catfish was so juicy inside. Not overdone at all. Complaint was the cajun fries...not enough cajun seasoning. 

I'm definitely having more cravings....I want some NOW! Will they deliver to CA? That would be GREAT!. Aaaah quelle belle ambiance! ça c'est un bon café-bar original, on peut le dire! Chouette décoration et nourriture végétarienne intéressante à déguster!
On y retrouve quelques objets médicinal étant donné que la place est située dans un immeuble où se trouvait la Pharmacie Esperanza. Cela donne un cachet supplémentaire!
Accès wifi. Vous pourrez vous y rendre même pour travailler! Dis-je à une période de l'année où les établissements scolaires sont en vacances ou presque ;). Fantastic little farmers market with fresh and delicious produce! I stocked up on fresh fruits that were exceptionally delicious. I loved their selection of fresh jams as well. Such a fun place to shop.. Surprisingly amazing! I was told not to even try finding good sushi in Montreal, but Mikado is more than decent. I've never been to a Japanese restaurant in North American that didn't give you a dehydrated pile of iceberg lettuce swimming in unappealing orange dressing, but here the salad was actually pretty good -- big tomatoes, fresh lettuce, and a reasonable amount of dressing. The seafood miso soup was full of whole scallops, shrimp, etc, and more than worth the price. The sashimi was quite fresh and the portion sizes weren't too big or too small. The restaurant looks kind of run-down and dirty from the outside (was initially quite disappointed because it honestly looked closed down) , but it's not that bad inside, though it's definitely nothing special.. The other reviews have covered it pretty well. What's really great here is not just wonderful smoked food, but the awesome prices. Get the Pitmaster Special combo, and you'll get 4 meats and 3 sides, with your choice from the 3 breads they make -- all for $20. There is enough food there for 3 adults, or eat some and take some home. Such a deal!  And there is no charge for extra plates. 

The owners run the place, and are always present. They are very friendly, and love to meet new patrons. We loved the meal and the staff so much, we came here a second time during our week in Las Vegas just to try more foods. We loved everything we tried. If they take a liking to you, they just might tell you about some items in the kitchen that are not on the menu. Ask about the bread pudding and sweet potato pie!

What would give it 5 stars?  Esoteric things only. This business has not been in its current location for long. Hopefully they will continue to improve the seating and decor as they go along. 

Dusty, if you are reading this, Hello from California. We'll be back!. From the moment I called to make my appointment, I was pleased and impressed with how helpful, attentive, and polite everyone is at the office. Dr. Yesnick was very informative; he explains each procedure as he performs them and encourages feedback. I felt assured and confident in everything he said and am overall pleased with my experience at Yesnick Vision. I'm also very happy with my new glasses and the features he recommended to have added to them. I've had them for one week now and my eyes feel much better! I will be recommending you guys. Thank you guys!!. Hands down, the BEST sushi in Phx metro area... Have been going since they opened, and it did take a while for them to fine-tune their staff/service, it's always been worth the wait for the amazing food. 

We moved to South Scottsdale a little over a year ago, so we started going to other sushi restaurants that were closer, or that seemed more convenient, and sometimes just to try someplace new, but they were all just mediocre.

We returned to Big Eye tonight because we were in the neighborhood,  and it was busy... Not bursting at the seems, but busy... The staff were all super friendly and helpful, the service was spot-on, and the food was TO DIE FOR as always! 

Big Eye, please open a location in South Scottsdale!!!. I was at Max's last weekend. I'm from Chicago, so I was looking forward to trying a German pub in the Deutschtown neighborhood. Our friend took us here, and I really enjoyed it!  

The service was great and very friendly. The beer selection was awesome, and all the food was delicious! The menu is huge! We ordered the soft pretzel appetizer and the sausage and cheese plate, and both were very tasty! The mustard dipping sauce is phenomenal! I couldn't get enough of it. I wish I had left room for dessert because everything sounded spectacular. 

The restaurant itself, which I heard used to be an old hotel, was quaint and cozy. I enjoyed the historical elements of the place; all very authentic and special. 

I will definitely recommend this pub to anyone traveling to Pittsburg!. I am glad I found this place but it is a bit far from where I am staying at in Phoenix. Their dumplings are really good, spicy cold potato salad was super good and refreshing but their green onion cake was a bit thick and starchy for me. I prefer Taiwan's thin and crispy green onion cake. Really clean inside and it is fresh, full of Asians!. the staff was awesome and the groomer that helped with my dog was outstanding!. We were impressed with the Cosmo.  We have stayed in several other Vegas hotels and were excited to try this one out.  Its beautiful on the inside and the rooms are nice and spacious.

We upgraded to a room with a balcony and view with the Japanese bath tub.  That was all very nice.  I enjoyed the patio which faced Aria and the tub for relaxing.  The room was pretty clean (I went through with anti-bacterial and wiped everything down).

Overall the gambling, food and drinks were quite expensive but that also means a lot of the lower class and/or partiers stay away :-)

Its centrally located so you can easily walk to other casinos.

The various restaurants although expensive were very good.  The buffet is disgusting and a joke, would never go back.  The Pablano restaurant is super yum but the portions are small.  The burger place is also very good with yummy milkshakes.

Mid way through our stay we upgraded to a view of the Bellagio fountains and that way fun!  We got to watch the show and watch people.  Only bummer was that room was slightly dirtier and the patio was pretty gross (needed to be clean- used q-tips were out there, etc) and the phone didn't work by the bed.  We told the front desk about it and they seem unconcerned.

All in all we would most definitely stay here again.. If I could, I would throw fistfulls of stars - buckets! boatloads! - at this Yelp review.  My experience at Alchemy: the Workshop was, hands down, the best salon experience that I have ever had.  
I tend to be a little neurotic when it comes to getting haircuts.  As a general rule, booking a salon appointment generally falls somewhere in line alongside root canals and blind dates on my anxiety scale: two hours in an uncomfortable chair trying to impress someone that I will probably never see again (of course I floss/love kids/get regular trims!) from which I leave sore, numb, and with the distinct impression that no one understood a thing I said.  I have left salons in rages, tears, and with my hair in a ponytail.  Alchemy: the Workshop has changed everything.  
First off, the atmosphere is AMAZING. The decor is chic and warehouse-y, but the people in it lend it a warmth and welcome that feels like coming home.  Everyone - from the receptionist to the owners themselves - is witty, playful, utterly charming, and goes out of their way to make you feel comfortable.  Would you like a complimentary beer while your color sets?  A paraffin wax dip between conditioning and cut?  Why not sit on the patio and enjoy the day during your gloss treatment?  Nothing is rushed.  Everyone listens, considers, and thoughtfully suggests solutions.  
As if that weren't enough, my stylist, Noelle, worked absolute magic with my hair.  Magic, I tell you.  I came in with a heavy, parched, sun-damaged curtain of lackluster waves plastered against my head and left with soft and silky, bouncy, weightless curls.  The cut is amazing.  The subtle color change is amazing.  The products she recommended are amazing.  Seriously, I drove to the mall afterwards just so that I could walk around in public with my movie-star hair.  Truth.
The only regret that I had upon leaving was that I had to wait four weeks before coming back.  I am absolutely sold on Alchemy: The Workshop.  Don't walk.  Run.  And tell everyone I said hi!. This is a charming European feeling Vegas cafe spot that serves wonderful espresso!. I met again with tami recently after giving birth and she is truly a baby whisperer. My latch is better and baby is happier. She takes her time and continues to answer my questions (no matter how crazy!) after. She is worth the time and money. Definitely a great investment to help!. It has been a year or so since I visited this cafe.  I don't have lasting memories of that visit recalling only that the food was okay.  It is nowhere on my daily travels and I had not returned until today.  Yes, the place is quaint, but only three tables were occupied on this evening during a drenching thunderstorm.  In any case, I stopped in today for sushi and ordered:

1. Vegetable tempura (deep fried sweet potato (MY FAV!), zucchini, broccoli and potato)
2.  Favorite Roll (crispy jumbo shrimp, spicy snow crab, avocado soybean paper with a spicy flavored mayo sauce)
3. Chicken tempura

The sushi was fantastic!  I am a sweet potato lover, so the vegetable tempura with a bit of crunch was delicious (am I partial?...yes!).  The chicken tempura was good, and my favorite seafood roll was pretty darn good as well!  I will be back very soon to give it  another try.

Oh, and I also had Miso soup.  I have read of its 'healing' properties so I wanted to give it a try.  Oddly enough, my visit was Monday and I was pretty sick and stuffy on Tuesday :(  Maybe just a coincidence...  

If you haven't visited the restaurant in a long while, give them another try. Perhaps the sushi chef has changed.  If not, my taste buds have changed for the better!. 4.5 stars from me!

This yogurt place is sort of hidden in Summerlin but it's the best frozen yogurt place in the Vegas area although I do have a few little suggestions to make this place a little better.  First of all I love the old school games here!  It's so cool to feel like a kid and eat ice cream (frozen yogurt actually, whatever- tastes the same to me) and play pacman.  The QUALITY of the toppings here is what makes this place better than the rest.  The toppings taste fresh, candy isn't stale like some of the other places I've been.  You pay more for quality here, the prices are higher than most other frozen yogurt places, I got a little sticker shock when I paid at the counter.  Overall this place is super cool, I'll be back here again for sure, and I'll still load up my cup with the yummy togurt flavors and toppings!. After reading many negative reviews, I was extremely skeptical to try this restaurant. However, I had a great experience!

I went for lunch, and for 12$ I had a chili burrito, soup, salad and coffee. Not a bad deal. The burrito and soup were both delicious. It wasn't too busy since it was lunch time, and we had good service.

Also love the decor and music.. This place just opened the other day. I was the first to order the ice cream cookie sundae! The ice cream is good. I was a little disappointed in the cookies because that's what they specialize in. The cookie was hard but I guess it need to be for ice cream sandwiches. I will go back to get the ice cream and try to cookies again. The girls were really nice. Overall 4 stars for customer device and the yummy malt crunch chocolate ice cream! The prices were also great.. This place was amazing! I came here with a friend for a business trip and as soon as we got into town and they got us in quickly on a Saturday! Not only did I get a gel manicure and pedicure (at the same time) I also got a waxing all under 45min! The service and quality of the services were not comped. These guys did a great job and I got to my appointment with time to spare. We will definitely be back here next time were in town!. I had a BIG problem! When the baby was born I put the kitty litter box in the garage. Well, that was too drastic in August for Penelope cat! So she peed on the couch--uggggh! I got in touch with Green Clean phx and they cleaned the urine and odor WITHOUT the use of harmful chemicals (NEWBORN in house). They got the cat pee out In the first treatment. Awesome.. These people are the best! Arlo is the most honest, hardworking person I have ever met! He has gotten my family out of so many nightmares, not to mention all my friends and their families! So lucky my son is good friends with him and recommended! The most economical repairs, as well. So refreshing after dealership ridiculous prices! Would not go anywhere else! Thanks for all your help AK!. The food is absolutely phenomenal! We've eaten here so many time this review is long overdue. Just brought my friend here for the first time the other day and she too fell in love. The calamari and shrimp are my two favorite appetizers. For entree, I am obsessed with the spaghetti and meatballs (truly the best here) and carbonara. Their pizzas, salads and other entrees are also good. Wolfgang Puck knows how to do it!. I spend a lot of time at Graze these days, so I'm going to share with you my 6-step program for doing Graze like a pro:   

1. Order The Retox (cachaça, maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne - what? what?) 
2. Graze from a basket of warm, salty, truffley popcorn. 
3. Enjoy that I'm-feeling-classy-even-though-I'm-wearing-snow-boots ambiance.
4. Order another Retox (heads up, two Retoxes and you are totally toxed)
5. Dine on any number of spectacular meals.
6. Indulge your voyeuristic tendencies by staring out the walls of windows to crazy, crazy Madison. 

I know this formula works.  Last night, as I piled the bibimbap onto my chopsticks and into my face, a protest for Tibetan freedom marched around the Capitol.  And in the moment, as much as I wanted to free Tibet, I wanted another bite of that marinated tofu more.. I absolutely adore Mexicasa.  We've been going there since it opened.  For starters, the salsa is spicy - I abhor going out for Mexican and getting wimpy salsa.  They also offer cheese dip and guacamole on the appetizer menu, and both are worth a try.
I have tried just about everything on this menu, and I have found nothing that I do not like!  The seven layer burrito is my absolute favorite.  I especially like that they will adjust ingredients per your request.  Super service, great people, and really fast take-out service!. Our 13 month old experienced a horrific trauma last month and we were airlifted to Sunrise. I believe with my whole heart that we couldn't have gotten better treatment. I can't say enough about the phenomenal doctors and generous-hearted nurses and respiratory therapists that we met. We were incredibly blessed by them all and are eternally grateful for the roles that each of them took in our miracle. I have never been in another PICU, but I can't fathom a better one.. My husband is a lifetime Pirates fan, but had never been to Pittsburgh until this year. The wait was worth it....PNC Park is amazing! Great views of the city and a well thought out design. The food was excellent (we even tried a Pierogi). We stayed right downtown and the park was easily accessible. Will definitely be returning. Just hoping that next time we will see a Pirates win! 

I have seen fourteen baseball stadiums and this one comes in a close second just behind AT&T in San Francisco.. Found our favorite Chinese Restaurant.  The food was hot, fresh and delicious.  And super large portions also.  The service was friendly and attentive.  We ordered the family dinner A came with soup, egg rolls, ragoons, chicken fried rice, sweet sour pork and Kung pao chicken.  It was soooo yummy.  Glad I live close by because I go there about 3-4 times a week.  Love Love Love this place!!. Such a great way to recover from workouts!  Instant mood and energy increase, and you can feel the difference almost immediately!. Maybe if the hotel rooms were rented under my name I'd be a little more annoyed, but I was there for a bachelorette party and I was there for the ride so I have no room to complain.

Our 2 night stay started off 3 stars though - gave us the wrong directions to the room, gave us 2 hotel rooms that weren't adjoining (even though they said they were), the rooms smelled, and it wasn't centrally air conditioned. WTF? The room wasn't THAT cheap.

So we asked for a comp to get upgraded since we wasted our time looking for our room. Instead they let us check out late, but we still had to pay an extra $20/night. Alright. Whatever. And they said the room wasn't adjoining. We'd make do.

But to our surprise, they WERE adjoining - yay! the rooms were much cleaner  and bigger. The 8 of us were much happier. Hence the 4 stars.

The casino was ok. It's undergoing construction so there's a lot of black curtains and detours. Boo. The slot machine I played was hot and I came back $27 richer. Yippee! :). Friday afternoon lunch. Yummy food, great service. The waitress saw us having problems with decision making and so she took her time to explain our options and helped us figure out what to get. We ended up with two split lunch specials and garlic and regular naan.
We ate lamb vindaloo, gobi manchurian, navratan korma, and chicken jalfrizi. Plus some awesome daal! 
Amazing lunch! Nicely decorated and clean dining area, outstanding service, scrumptious food.. Great customer service! They are really working for small businesses  to get their name out there.. Wow. Just, wow. This show exceeded all expectations I had going in. Of course it helps if you are an MJ fan, but even if you're not there is so much to love about this Cirque performance. It was a packed theatre, but no bad seats...a definite must see for Vegas visitors.. Fantastic place to buy a vehicle!  We got a great deal on our 2015 GMC Sierra truck.  Our salesman, Sam Mitchell, was great to work with. There was a mistake on the sales contract so I let them know and the sales manager, Jeremy, immediately offered to write us a corrected contract even thought we had signed the 1st one the previous day. Everyone, from Sam to the finance lady, to the sale manager, Jeremy, went out of their way to make sure we were happy and satisfied. Everyone was so friendly and helpful.  Fantastic customer service!. Since I stumbled into Montreal 7 months ago, I've been on a quest to find the best café in the city - a delicate balancing act between quiet cozy-hip ambiance, stellar service, great pastries and transcendent coffee. I may just have found it at Le Couteau.

The cafe itself is somehow both airy and earthy. Grab a seat by the window and bask in that lovely light, watch the people pass on St. Denis and snicker at their envious glances. The music is low, and there's a pleasant chatter - great for reading or brunch.The cashiers are lovely, putting up with my halting French and switching fluidly to English when needed. 

I got a gluten-free brownie, which was amazing - teetering between fudgey and cakey, and intensely chocolatey throughout. The coffee - oh man - is like liquid gold. It has a bold, nutty-acidic front, but without the usual sour back end I'd come to expect.
Get a cappuccino with almond milk, which mellows the kick nicely. A bit pricey, but worth it even for a broke student like me.

Seriously, I hesitated writing this review because this place is so good that I'm not even sure I want to share. This review is a true act of altruism, fellow Yelpers. Don't let it be in vain.. I love this place! Soul food done the way it should be. They also host a monthly comedy show called Unplanned Comedy Live. It's a monologue based improv show that has local celebrities as guest monologists. Great venue, great food/drinks, great service!. awesome shredded beef tacos! Nice people.  Great weekday specials. 99 cent tacos on Tuesday are the bomb.. Mmmmmm, I went back here last night to try their lattes as I haven't tried them yet and my friend and I are on a coffee tour of Phoenix. They were delicious! The coffee was not too acidic and the barista even made a design in the foam.... I felt like I was back in Seattle. My friends also got some dinner, but I was going out later so I passed (begrudgingly). I tried a bite of theirs, though. The roasted chicken pasta was delicious, the chicken was so flavorful and the sauce was creamy, yet light. My other friend got mashed potatoes and hummus (weird dinner). The potatoes were really good, but the hummus wasn't anything special. We also shared a bread pudding. Wow.... this was super yummy.... it has a mountain of cinnamon -y whipped cream on top..... *drool*

So Liberty market continues to be one of my fave restaurants in the valley.... everything is just so good!. Two words. GOOD MORNING! I lost complete track of time here and ended up walking out around 7am in the bright as sunlight feeling like I was on a walk of shame!! I had a blast and so did all of my girlfriends, the whole club is pretty big and dark and just ... so Vegas!  Don't let the weird and creepy casino that this place is in change your mind about going in. Good times lie inside!. Local Brew and casual environment to just chill and enjoy some good beers with friends. Mr Pineapple is my fav summer beer!! So tasty, light, and refreshing!. The Lazy River on the website is what initially drew me in, and am I glad it did! 

The front desk is totally accommodating with taxis to airport, directions to local dining areas, changing rooms for a quieter scene. 

Then, the spa is to die for. Try the turquoise massage. You'll never want to leave. 

Then, the pool area is full of great waiters and waitresses- ready to serve and bring over some poolside cocktails or food. 

End the night with some beers by the the firepits. Ooo la la. 

Overall, a beautiful resort that is centrally located. Right across from an outdoor mall, 20 minutes from Scottsdale, 3.5 hours from Grand Canyon.. I love writing great reviews!  My experience with this company was short and sweet, mostly because of their phenomenal customer service!  The water heater at my home started leaking yesterday morning, and shortly thereafter there was no hot water to the home.  After reading this company's reviews, I called to just get some basic info.  What I got was the opportunity to speak to Tom, one of the owners, who gave me a quote on the spot AND offered same day service.  Not only did I get a reasonable price for the replacement, including labor, materials, warranty, and haul away of the old water heater, but the technician Angel was out to do the replacement within a few hours.  Happy Customer :). This place is the best!  We had a great great time.  The staff was super friendly and really hustled.  My party really enjoyed the food and it was resonably priced.  Best part - No drink minimum!  This is great for me, becuase I don't drink.  We will deifinitely be back!. We recently had our wedding catered by Bruce Brown.  Their attention to detail was immaculate and excuted to perfection.  The food was absolutely delicious.  Their set up for cocktail hour and the reception was outstanding and transformed the venue into a beautiful setting.  Their staff was very freindly, professional and catered to every request.   They did not miss a beat.  Thanks to Bruce Brown, Susan and staff for a wonderful experience.  If you are looking for a caterer for your wedding, look no further than Bruce Brown Catereing.  They are the best!!. I bought a refurbished laptop here and have been very satisfied with the customer service since. Everyone who's helped me has been friendly, patient and thorough.

I wish they were open later during the week or on Sundays(the Peoria location is).. Enjoyed a great dinner last night and plan to return soon. Love the atmosphere and the service was flawless.  But what about the food?  Great value and delicious. Highly recommend the potato chips and the new take on tuna and noodles.  Our group also loved the chicken paprikash and the poor man's paella.  Wonderful addition to the east side.. Absolutely delicious! And Gluten friendly! The Margharitas are to die for!

I've had the chile rellenos with beef, they come in a delicious sauce and no egg batter, very yummy

The Rib eye Steak was cooked to perfection the side salad and chiles toreados were delicious and fresh oh so fresh!

The Carnitas de puerco are well, fatty as they should be.

In December they had Champurrado and tamales utterly sinful deliciousness.

By the way for those who posted bad reviews, Leticias does not serve yellow cheese, so if you were expecting  Tex Mex this is not the place, this is very authentic mexican dishes, made as if in mexico.  

And unfortunately to the couple that went there for valentines day, i was there too, it was super crowded and hectic. I have ordered the fish tacos and i didn't like them either, it was exactly how the review said it, shredded or ground fish yuck and almost non of it in the taco, so I suggest against the fish tacos. But everything else just makes up for it! It really does!. Dr Jennifer is amazing! Her staff is professional and courteous! I am impressed how well everyone did with my 3 wee ones! I highly recommend anyone to get their glasses here!. Ordered a pepperoni pizza and eggplant parmesan sandwich. Pizza was average but not bad by any means. Sandwich was delicious. Will definitely order from here again based on their speedy delivery and will try the garlic knots next by all of the great reviews i've seen. Thank you Rustica Pizzeria.. AMAZING!! Came here for lunch around 3pm during the week. Great timing, no wait and was seated at the counter that looks into the kitchen. Very tiny place but so good it doesn't matter. My girlfriend and I started with tempura green beans and crispy chicken skins!! Both SOO good it looked like a lot but we ended up finishing it all. For our main course we got a NY steak and a burger. Sounds pretty simple but the was it was prepared was awesome! Our seats allowed us to talk to one of the cooks so it made the experience pretty cool. We ended up leaving only paying $25 each since we split it. Only $50 for all that food! I left full and my wallet was happy as well. I will be back to try the thee awesome things on the menu.. Okay so here is the deal with Stingray..Is it the best sushi, no, but the location (old town) is great and pretty convenient. I love to be adventurous with food, especially sushi, but the times where I want something I know I'm going to like, this is the spot. The service is always good, and so is the food. You have to try their Shrimp Shumai. You're welcome ;). A very good Chinese restaurant.  The taste is authentic, and the service is fast.  It gets crowded during dinner times and late night.  My husband and son love the spicy beef noodle soup.  I had the Pai Gu noodle soup. Didn't really like it.  I think I will go with something else next time.. In love with their fried calamari's. This place rocks, simply because it checks off all my "must haves" to make a great breakfast: soy lattes, egg whites, and turkey bacon! 

Seems simple, however you'll be amazed at how uncommon it is to find turkey bacon in a world filled with a bacon obsession! 

It's a little bit of a different dining format, but seems to work pretty well. You enter through the doors and are greeted with sleek screens that display the menu, as you wait in line to order from the counter. Once you order, you're given a table number and your beverage then off to pick an open table (note: it will be busy anytime before 2pm on the weekend, much like everyone else in this city), but I've never not been able to find a table. Chairs are a little uncomfortable... You know... That trendy, aluminum, "repurposed/green" lawn chair type of chair. Nothing that will ruin breakfast, just leave with with some super awesome indents in your legs for a good 15 minutes. 

There are a good amount of TVs in the place, and they usually have some sort of game playing -- they are soccer friendly -- so you can watch some champions league while chowing down.

Dishes I recommend: Gringo Burrito, French Toast, and the Huevos Rancheros, and of course, a soy latte ;). The best vegan meal we had in Vegas, if not the best of any meal since we became vegan.

We had:
Salted Beets w/Pistachios: Amazing
Artichoke Flatbread: Fantastic
Quinoa with Eggplant Caponata: Incredible (husband doesn't even LIKE eggplant, but he couldn't stop talking about this dish)
Gardein Chicken w/celery root puree: Friggin Unbelievable

The atmosphere is great, the space is beautiful, and the service is awesome.  My only complaint, and the reason there are 4 stars, and not 5:  Even though they boast a huge collection of wines and the Wynn touts itself as being very vegan-friendly, they had no vegan wines (most wines are refined with egg whites or some other animal product).  It's not their fault that they had no wine, really, but more the fault of the Wynn.  You can see my review here:

http://www.yelp.com/biz/wynn-las-vegas-las-vegas-3#query:the%20Wynn

I asked when we made the reservation if they had vegan wines, and was told that they do not, nor does the Wynn have any vegan wines at all. Period.  I asked if we could bring our own wine, as I was told that yes, we could, but there was a 2 bottle minimum.  Luckily, we had rented a car, so we drove to Whole Foods, and picked out 2 bottles of vegan wine.  When we arrived at La Cave, and were seated at our table, we were informed that the corkage fee was $50 PER BOTTLE.  With a 2 bottle minimum!  I told the server that we were very disappointed and felt like we were getting ripped off.  The had no vegan wine, so we had to go buy our own, and now we were going to have to pay $100 just to drink it.  All we wanted was to sip some wine while we enjoyed our romantic dinner.  Our server told the manager, who then came and told us that this one time, as an exception, they would waive the corkage fees.  This was by no means something they normally would do, but they did it as a courtesy to us.  We were so grateful for this act on their part.  It was so kind and generous of them.

We loved our meal at La Cave.  We will go back if they perhaps start carrying vegan wine (please!!!), or if we don't plan on drinking at all.. I just moved to the Steele Creek area of Charlotte and have been looking to find a new nail salon for a few weeks now. I have seen the salon before whenever I was picking up sushi from the restaurant "Cherry" next door, so I decided to give it a try today on a whim. 
I did not call ahead - but I only waited about 25 minutes. Everyone was extremely nice and welcoming, offering refreshments while you waited (wine too!). They had a great nail color selection behind the large nail bar as well. 
I got a classic pedicure and gel manicure. My technician was Wendy and she was amazing. She was very attentive and my nails have never looked this good. I had recently injured one toe so I made her aware of it and she was gentle and she took her time on it. 
The price was very reasonable & I will definitely be back! :)
Highly recommended!. I had my rehearsal dinner here; they accommodated about 50 of us. The service was just amazing and their food, as always, was delectable. It's a classy place for all of your guests to pick and choose what they want without having to go to a casino buffet or have a full menu. Two thumbs up.. Came here for brunch on my anniversary. No question about it, I would give 6 stars if it was an option. Brunch is unlimited tapas style plates for 34.99 and unlimited mimosas for $10 more. We loved every dish that we ordered, including a "secret menu" barbacoa slider which was definitely the highlight of the meal. We tried every flavor of Mimosa that they offer, the blood orange is the best! Our server Rachel S. was awesome, we never waited long for anything and she gave us some great locals spots to visit in the future. Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to have a good brunch on the strip!. Great steaks for the price. Always consistent. Half wedge salad is good without the red wine sauce. You can order additional oz only on the prime rib. Depending what outback you're at. The cost can range from $1 to $2.. We were dying for some pizza after a long day of walking and shopping. Grimaldis was right in our path so of course that's where we went. The hostess informed us that the ovens were being cleaned and we were more then welcome to order anything else from the menu but we wouldn't be able to get an my pizza for about a half hour, after debating we decided to get a table anyway since our feet were killing us.
We ordered a caprese salad, Greek salad, personal pizza and a cheese pizza. Not only did our salads come out in less then 10 minutes, but our pizzas came out way faster then quoted and we were in and out in less then 40 minutes with a party of 5. More then pleased!. I must confess that my visit to Roadrunner is a bit of a blur.  I had been out all night with friends and lost my voice and went to Roadrunner with my brother to escape the strip and watch some football.  It was a quality bonding experience.  I remember the salads being good.  I remember that the Cal game wasn't on and I was basically told that it would not be put on for me because no one cared about that game.  Probably true.  I remember that I drank a beer in the hopes of curing my hangover.  I remember that didn't work.

11/05/07 Update:
Breakfast is good enough, but not fantastic.  Interesting menu with biscuit and gravy type things, but the biscuits are marginal, I warned you.. Must try their Hoi An chicken with ginger steam rice. It was so good. The price is even better $4.95 per plate. The male owner was very nice and attentive. The lady owner was more like straight to the point kind of person, but she wasn't rude or anything. This is a small restaurant with very casual setting, so if you are expecting something fancy this is not it. What is great about this restaurant is that it's located in the strip of local stores next to kungfu boba tea and shave ice. You can go for dessert after your meal without the hassle of finding parking.. I love the way the studio looks! Everyone is very nice and funny and it really has a good atmosphere. I got the deep conditioning treatment and my friend got a really awesome looking ombre by rachele. She was super nice and very meticulous. I would definitely come here again to get my hair done! Also they have good coffee. My husband and I went for our 1 year anniversary. They kindly placed us in a quiet corner and gave us a complimentary dessert to top off our celebration.

The meal was absolutely fantastic! Excellent service and delectable meal. From the artichoke appetizer to the stuffed pastas. I don't know how you could ever go wrong with anything on the menu.

My compliments to Gaetano's!. WOW!!  Where do you find somewhere that has staff willing to go the extra mile any more?  AMAZING, friendly, courteous and outstanding effort.  Called there tonight to inquire if they had a specific drawer knob.  Mike didn't hum-ho on the phone, nor did he make a guess.  He said, give me just a moment and I will go check to make sure.  That is exactly what he did, a few moments later he got back on the phone and stated that he indeed had them but only had two of them.  Two is EXACTLY what I need.  Come on peeps, to most it would simply be "just a knob", he had no idea that I had been searching for this specific knob for a couple weeks.  I'm a local business owner, and I know how tough it is to find "quality" employees.  OUTSTANDING effort Mike.  I'll be there tomorrow to pick up my knobs!. I can't believe I haven't written a review of this place yet! We've been going since they were two doors down and the food is just as excellent as it ever way. I always order the soyrizo burrito. It is amazing. My husband likes variety so we have tried a lot of their menu and wow is it excellent.. Was just here for some apps decent service and drinks not to over priced for las vegas I would go again. Came in to this store to get some battery assistance...these hard working guys accommodated me right away and fit me in to their already maximum work load. I was patient and they were super great about getting everything done efficiently and without breaking the bank. They were thorough and even brought me back to the service grate to show me why the issues were. I appreciate that...so awesome! Thank you Pep Boys!! You guys ROCK in my book.. We had a King signature suite room on the west wing, and boy did me and my boy friend LOVE this place! It's so spacious with a huge bed and great bathroom with a tone of mirrors everywhere. Our view wasn't too great but the staff was excellent! Not only to mention my boy friend and I even won money from their casino! Way better than some of the other hotels I've been to in vegas!. Donuts, fried chicken, and coffee all in one place? What more could a girl ask for? Looking to fill my saturated fat intake and caffeine jolt for the day, we headed here on a mission for some good eats. There was a fairly steady line while we were here at the restaurant. We got here around noon, and they were already sold out of chicken wings, and at least half of the donuts (Btw, who sells out of chicken wings by lunchtime? Is there a secret coalition of dedicated eaters who descend upon the restaurant like a plague, to only voraciously consume chicken wings in the wee hours of the morning? We may never know...). Anyways, I had a breast combo which included a side and donut. I substituted a chipotle limon donut for the plain cake that is normally included with the meal, and had the slaw and Vietnamese sauce over the chicken. I also had an iced coffee.

The donut was excellent. It had the right balance of tender, yet chewy cake contrasting with the slight crunch on the outside. I also liked how it wasn't exceedingly sugary, which allowed a better balance of flavors to show through. 

The slaw was crisp, with a good mixture of sweet and vinegar. My friend had the cucumber salad, which was too salty overall, but had a good crisp texture. The chicken was expertly cooked, with a perfect crispy crust, and juicy, tender meat. I tried some of the Korean spicy sauce and preferred it to over the Vietnamese style sauce on my piece. Strangely enough, the Korean style sauce was more subtle than the Vietnamese sauce, not something you'd often say when comparing the two cuisines! For me, the glaze on my chicken was too concentrated.

The iced coffee was smooth, and had more of a lighter flavor. For add-ins, they have milk, cream, and almond milk, as well as Stevia and sugar in the raw.

Service was fast and friendly, and despite having a steady stream of customers to serve, our orders came out quickly. 

Overall, this is a great choice for a fast, affordable, and filling meal. I'll definitely be going here again!. This is the BEST Cheesesteak I have ever had! The meat was juicy and the mushrooms and onions were cooked perfectly too! The fry sauce was out of this world. We also tried the tomato bisque which was extremely tasty! I only wish we had one back home in California.. The renovation has served this location well. I didn't feel like I was sitting on someone's lap like the first time I wandered in. Great neighborhood joint for lunch or dinner. Ya gotta try the Prickly Pear Chicken once in your life.. I am truly a pizza snob since I grew up in the Chicago area! Deep dish pizza is king in Chi-Town, but I must say I thoroughly enjoyed this super thin crust pizza! My husband and I doctored it up by adding more cheese, bacon and onions which took it over the top!! I must say, I was pleasantly surprised!. I thought that this place would have a homemade from the kitchen feel but it's very modern inside. I wish it would feel more homey.. 

Aside from that, the food is excellent. Have been here a few times and  have come for breakfast and dinner. No long lines, comfortable seating. OKAY service. The people in the front aren't that friendly and neither are the servers. 

I generally just come here for their amazing food. I've had what Adam ordered on Man vs. Food and it's excellent. Except for this one time when I ordered it for dinner and the mashed potatoes were hard and tasted like paste. So lesson learned don't order breakfast for dinner. 

So, atmosphere, service is ok but come here for the food. It's good!. I got my tattoo here the end of February 2015. I absolutely love it! The entire experience was great. This was only my second tattoo ( my first was done by a close friend) so I was very nervous. When I walked in I was greeted very nicely and Eric was extremely helpful. He was nice, thorough and helpful. The entire process took less than an hour and I am very satisfied with his work! I will defiantly be returning for more work.. I love Halloween!  Each year I either make my costume or use pieces from my wardrobe.  When I was growing up each of my costumes were made by my grandma.  I had never bought a costume until this year. 

I attempted to make a flapper dress out of film strips because I wanted to tote a recycled costume but that never happened.  I couldn't figure out how to do it so it would look nice. 

We had many exciting things happening the weekend before Halloween and for the night of, so I really really really wanted a costume.  I looked online, but I never buy clothes online.  I must see how it looks on me. 

SO! We headed to Easley's!  What a super fun experience.  It was definitely packed, but it was a few days before Halloween, so that was expected.  I wanted matching costumes. Gary is always Young Dr. McCoy from Star Trek and I did not want to be a Star Trek girl... 

So we hunted and tried and hunted and tried more costumes on.  

We eventually decided to be Batman and Batgirl.   We looked super cute!  

I had a great experience finding a costume.  I even still wear my gloves and mask around the house!. Best Thai in the area.  That's not really saying much, but it's actually on par with your average Thai restaurant in SF or NYC.  My favs are the heaven duck, devil fish, papaya salad & panang curry.  They also have the only edible pad thai around.  It's the correct color, consistency, flavor and they don't cut the noodles into a million pieces like Basil Thai - imagine!. Omg their pastries are so good! I finally stopped by the other week and picked up some of their baked goods. I got my family hooked on their products. Since then we always have a box of German sweets in the kitchen. Aside from baked goods the bakery sells other German delicacies that ranges from sauages, snacks and my all time Geman favorite Happy Hippos.. I was sure I'd reviewed here, but maybe I've been reviewing in my sleep (again). Sleeping - now there's a nice segue to my review of staying at Hotel du Vin.

I'd stayed here previously, and was definitely tainted by that experience as I'd been upgraded to a suite. I remembered the breakfast was delicious, the bed was comfy and there was a massive claw-foot bath (which I didn't have time to use, but it was nice to look at). 

This time I was in a standard double room and the difference was noticeable as the room was quite a lot smaller. There isn't really too much else that's different though, there's still a bath (with the shower) and there's a desk if you need to get some work done. The beds are massive and you wouldn't find yourself short of a pillow. On my first night's stay I was in a room on the first floor, behind the bar and was kept awake all night by a weird plumbing noise in the room, and could also hear the person above me moving around their room. Thankfully, getting moved to another room wasn't a problem and the lovely lady on the front desk had it sorted for me in a short while. 

The room I was moved to was on the other side of the hotel, but sadly had the same plumbing noise - possibly the air conditioning? I can mostly sleep through anything (e.g. Olympic football matches) so it was annoying to be kept awake by this noise. 

My only other grumble was at breakfast. On the first day, they were able to oblige my gluten free request and I got a bread basket of GF bread as well as GF bread with my eggs Benedict. However, on the second day they were out of GF bread, and still hadn't restocked on the third day. That made me a little sad as with such a fancy hotel, you'd think they'd join the dots and get some bread in. 

Otherwise, my stay was pleasant and comfortable. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and the barman in the evening happily kept me going with pistachios which was very kind of him. The staff were really helpful when I asked to move rooms, and I enjoyed being able to sit in the bar of an evening having a drink before going to bed.. Great customer service, enjoyable/fun atmosphere, and always changing flavors and toppings! A must see in the neighborhood/area!. Me and 3 coworkers stopped here for breakfast on 10/30/12.
I found it on Yelp and we decided to try it since they had better reviews than other breakfast places in the area.
We were not disappointed, food and service were very good.
I ordered eggs Benedict, I think California... I liked the fact that they have 3 kinds of potatoes (regular, Cajun and Greek I think). I ordered Greek and they were really good.

I give them only 4 stars because I chose Benedict California because it said it had avocado... and it took me a little while to find the avocado : P  At first I thought they had forgotten it, but then I found the tiny slices : (
It was still good.

Oh, almost missed to mention, prices are very reasonable.. I few years back I worked around the block from MacAlpines. My coworkers and I would go there for lunch and several rounds of freshmade cherry cokes. YUMMM!!!! I miss those days!!. This is hands down the best coffee in Charlotte. I've tried almost every other place in the city (I've been on a search for good coffee here for years), and this place beats them all. My favorite drinks are the vanilla cold brew (no cream) and the iced caramel latte. They all have the perfect balance of the flavor and the coffee. You won't regret trying this place out!. Ooh La La! I found French heaven in a strip mall in the middle of the desert! I had a hard time finding this little gem so for the uninitiated, it is across Charleston from Boca Park tucked behind Flemming's. Highlights.....Salted Caramel Macarons, Escargot!!!!!, Croque Monsieur wonderful soups and pastries and, and, and..... I mean really.....where can you get some crusty bread and some garlicky escargot that does not require a fine dining price. Ho ho ho Escargot!. nice place to eat, very quiet and the decoration is traditional but unique. Food will never make you disappointed. I went there often before, memorable and sweet.. I am so happy with my business with Las Vegas color graphics. The original company that was going to print my wedding invites fell though last minute and I was in a panic. Las Vegas color graphics promised to get the job faster than any other place in town I had called. They also did it for cheaper. My invites are beautiful and I got them when they promised! They were a real life saver!. The food is good really filling !! Usually when we end our Vegas trip we have breakfast here it's not too bad great drinks!. Great place with great service and sushi! Everything was very fresh and for very reasonable prices. I spent $56 on tons of food for 2 people that I would have spent double in most sushi restaurants. The place must have a lot of return customers bc the owners and staff greet many by their first name. I highly recommend this place and when I visit SC again, I will definitely make another stop here!. This place is amazing. I could have spent hours looking over their vast assortment of awesome vintage finds. I thought their prices were pretty reasonable, but that might be because I live in New York, where kitschy vintage stuff/collectibles in good condition are way overpriced. Roger was super helpful and friendly, and recommended some tourist spots for our drive back home. We were so happy to have stumbled upon this cool shop.. Very cool idea repurposing the church building into a brewery. Went with a group of 5 and everyone liked their drink. Had the beer sample flight, which was fun. It allows you to try their more popular beers before deciding on one to commit to. People in my group liked it. I'm not a beer fan, so I had a mango sangria, which was tasty. They do have a good number of non-beer choices for those who aren't beer fans. We also got two pizzas that were pretty scrumptious. 

The good food/drink and the unique atmosphere make it somewhere worth checking out. I'm pretty sure this will be one of the places that I will be bringing friends visiting me in Pittsburgh.. 1st time  eating here , the server was so nice and patience  .  We order the Joe breakfast and it was delicious   along with French Toast  with peanut butter . We had a great time and the place looked clean . I will definitely  go back and try more stuff. They advertise themselves as being the "Chipotle of Middle Eastern food" and they are exactly that. Just like Chipotle is not "authentic" Mexican food, Naf Naf is not authentic Middle Eastern food. It's good for what it is. Fast food. Prices are around the same as what you'd pay at Chipotle: about $6.50 for a vegan (falafel) pita wrap, $7 for a chicken shawarma wrap, and $7.50 for beef shawarma. The assembly line and employees still need to work some kinks out (for example, I as asked three times if I'd like to make my meal a combo; I had asked for soup at the beginning of the ordering process and this was not communicated down the line). The food is good, about on par with Chiptle. Portions are also decent. Is it as good as Banzo (as another couple sitting next to me loudly exclaimed)? Nah, but it'll do in a pinch.. We came in on Friday night for date night, not really sure what to expect except what we had read on Yelp. It was pretty busy so we couldn't get a seat in the bar area. The dining room was busy too so we grabbed a drink while we waited for a table to open up. It took about 10 minutes to get a drink, and by that time a table had opened up for us. Our server, Clayton, was super nice even though he seemed a bit frantic. 

We ordered crispy gnocchi, bacon-wrapped meatballs, spicy seafood pasta and the short ribs. Everything was fantastic, except the pasta was JUST OK. It was good, it just tasted like something I could easily make at home and there wasn't that much seafood in it. 

The ambiance is a bit strange. It's beautiful inside, but also kind of weird at the same time. The decor doesn't completely mesh, but somehow it's still cozy. I will say though, they should turn the music up a notch and dim the lights a notch as well. 

For our drinks, we ordered the bourbon mule, which I surprisingly liked even more than the vodka version, moscow mule. Clayton never left us hanging and checked on us JUST enough. At the end of the meal, our bill was about $75, which is not bad at all. We will definitely be coming back but we decided this is more of a hang out in the lounge and order a few drinks and food items from the apps list, not so much a romantic dinner type place.. I had a very good experience at Posh.  When making reservations I was kindly asked if I wanted their parking details emailed to me.  This made it a breeze knowing ahead of time that they have reserved parking and complimentary valet in the parking garage directly below their establishment.

With the improvisational menu, you cross off on the list which meats you DO NOT want to partake in.  Since kangaroo was not currently being offered, I selected the venison, quail and goose for the entries of my five course meal.  

To start, the amuse bouche was a delightful daikon topped with fish eggs, drizzled with a bonito glaze.  The tomato based soup was okay but the butter cardamon fused butter that accompanied the rolls were a knock out!  My venison that arrived stuffed inside a sausage casing had a complimentary glaze that was tasty but the meat was unfortunately dry on the inside. The side of cauliflower was charred nicely, though.  The grilled quail was the bomb perfect in every way!  Being the fatter side of the quail, it was well marbled and delicious - served in a sweet glaze!  My husband paid for the upgrade of $20.00 for the Kobe beef which was great!  Just a bit too much salt rub on the outside, was the only complaint on this item.
My goose was good and not gamy tasting but just a tad chewy.  I can handle that!
For dessert, the chocolate flour less cake served with chocolate sorbet and paper thin chocolate leaf ended the meal on a high note for moi! 

The only draw back would be the wine.  The glass I was served didn't taste as fresh as I had hoped for.  I left Posh feeling pretty full with just the five course tasting meal.  (And I'm know amongst my friends as "the petite gal that can eat!"  

I'm looking forward to another wonderful dining experience when I return to Posh!. Got an overlay (acrylic over my nails, no tips) with gel polish and designs. I used a picture from Pinterest as inspiration and Tiffany nailed it. Very creative lady!. This place is truly like no other coffee shop in Vegas. It's got a very traditional, Seattle-ish (not that I've ever been but this is what I would imagine) atmosphere to it. The Benneton Club and I went there on Sunday afternoon after catching a movie, it was rainy (maybe that is where I got the Seattle association from) and it was the perfect place to sit and watch the rain. They've got little park-like benches inside with some chairs and a community table for those working on lap tops. I peaked upstairs real quick and got a look at some more table and chairs on that level. 

Oh, I'm sorry - my vanilla latte was DELICIOUS and it came with a heart on top which officially bumped them back up to 5 stars in my book.

The only downgrade was that their blenders were not up and working yet so I could not get a fru-fru drink but I wanted something warm on this dreary day regardless.

I'd totally recommend spending any Sunday afternoon reading the day away at Sambalatte.. Great healthy food. Smoothies are amazing and breakfast sandwich was fresh and refreshing!. This is a great place to hang out with your friends and enjoy the ambience~ I love the interior~ the food is good and the service is good~
Try the boneless chicken wings with some blueberry soju!. I love this place and the food is great too. They also have a great customer service. I will definitely go back.. Great:  Food portions, drink selections, delicious food, service!  Overall, I rate this a 5, you can't get this kind of food many places, and they sure know how to cook it!  YUMMY!!!  You have to go see for yourself.  Coconut  Curry Pulled Pork- Amazing!

Poor: Water served warm, smaller cramped seating, expensive drinks.. I came here after work last week to have dinner with my sister, the food was really good and they have some nice specials.  There is a lot of seating in the bar area, including a few booths and high-top tables.  Our waitress was very helpful and explained the specials including in the happy hour specials.  I had the chicken tacos with mango salsa with strawberries, and rice and black beans on the side and a sommerbrau to wash it all down. The flavors were great and complimented each other.   Perfect!. Note: I have only been here once as my fiance isn't a big fan of Indian food.. but I have been day dreaming about it ever since.

My friend I grabbed lunch here on a Friday afternoon. Considering we went during what would normally be considered the "lunch rush", I was surprised that it wasn't more crowded. But, she had raved about their lunch specials so I was excited to try TT out. We were quickly greeted with ice water and offered fresh brewed chai. Our waiter was great. While he was new (he had just started a week before) but was friendly, knowledgeable and seemed super enthusiastic about the food.

We decided to split an order of Samosas to start. Wow, best Samosas that I have had EVER. The outside was cooked perfectly, soft but crispy and warm. The filling of potatoes and peas was creamy and spiced perfectly. They were served with a garbanzo masala chutney that was out of this world. Seriously I could have eaten the chutney with a spoon.

My friend had the lamb vindaloo which is the special on Friday, so she was served her main course, a salad, rice and naan. This is the dish she had raved to me about, and she seemed to be equally pleased with it the day we went. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and it didn't disappoint. The chicken was tender and the sauce was wonderfully creamy with just enough heat. I also ordered a side of chili naan... it was huge WAY too much for one person, but was so delicious I wanted to eat the whole order. 

I will be back... And, while I would like to say that I will try other dishes, it will be hard to pull myself away from the Samosas... and the Chicken Tikka Masala. Seriously. Check this place out.. Had a great lunch here today. Sat outside the weather was prefect for it, people watching was great. Jamie was our server she was both genuinely friendly and super attentive with out being pushy. Turkey burgers were a nice surprise to see and they were very tasty. The Arizona peach is nice light and refreshing while my husbands Ips was a bit bitter for me. glad I tried this place out and we will go back for sure.. Thank you to Yelp.com we found this little place to check out for dinner before our movie last night. 

The building has been many things over the years, and Arbys included, so it isn't the nicest of buildings. It is very plain and minimal. But I don't plan to eat the decorations, so who cares. You can either order over the phone to pick up or stop in for take out r grab a seat in the dining room and have a waitress. They are busier more for lunch they told us, more to-go at night. They are family owned, very obvious by the owners children helping out behind the counter. I love family owned places. They just feel homeir. 

We sat down to eat. We ordered the crab puffs, terriaki chicken and sweet and sour chicken. All great. The crab puffs had just enough crabby flavor, and the entrees were very large portions of tasty goodness, with plenty to take home and have for lunch the next day. The boyfriend even liked it, and its hard to get him to like Asian food.  

Check them out! Let them know Yelp set you. Yummy!. Great service and best carwash. My SUV was washed as if it was his own. No water marks and clean rims. So excited to have them in the neighborhood. Everyone working was friendly and attentive.. Great food and large portions!  Always love to eat here!  This place is a family favorite.. I came here with some friends after dinner to grab some drinks. It's a nice place with a good ambience. We sat upstairs and were hoping to find a place out on the terrace but it was all full. I had a pint of their blanche which was nice and light. They charge about $6-$6.50 for a pint which is pretty reasonable and the servers were all pretty friendly too. Seems like a pretty nice place to hang out. Will definitely love to go back!. My friend and I were only going to be in Las Vegas for one night -- so we decided to try Jayde Fusion as we had watched Restaurant Express and were impressed by the sincerity and demeanor of Chef Seonkyoung on the show.
Boy are we glad we did. From the moment we were seated and throughout the delicious meal everyone was friendly, helpful and seemed to gout of there way to make it a memorable meal. Our server, Jenny, was on top of her game and out entrees literally came out in 10 minutes -- AND the restaurant was packed.
The Chow Fun was perfect with in house made noodles; Korean tacos, really good, spicy seafood noodles, fresh and chocked full of shrimp, clams, mussels, lettuce wraps, we should have ordered another plate to take with us!
When the bill arrived, we were pleasantly surprised on how reasonable it was. Next time we are in Las Vegas, this is the place we will go -- again.. LOVED Beef and Bottle!  Like others, I have driven past thisplace for years and been told how good it was, but it was a Living Social that finally got me there. WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG????  I have been to all the fancy steak houses in Charlotte...they are great, but for my money, I will come back to Beef and Bottle every time.  I had the filet and lobster tail combo; for $45 I got a salad, a side item, a 6 oz filet that was expertly prepared and a LARGE lobster tail....you just can't get that quantity of food or quality for $45 anywhere else in CLT.  I also loved the atmosphere; so laid back...it was refreshing.  Folks aren't there to been seen (like at Del Friscos); just there for some great steak/seafood.  Also, on Sunday and Thursday night, wine is 1/2 price by the glass or bottle.  I had a glass of excellent Argentinan Malbec for $3.75 and it was the largest pour I have ever received in a restaurant.  My husband and I each had drinks, steak, lobster tail, salad and sides...and the bill totaled $110.  You won't find that anywhere else  Run, don't walk to Beef and Bottle.. Had an awesome birthday dinner here for my husband thanks to our server Craig! 
We took advantage of our rewards card and started with the Garlic, Artichoke, Spinach Dip which was delicious (especially those little cheesy triangles of deliciousness they serve it with).
For entrees he went with the Lobster and Shrimp Fettuccine which he couldn't stop raving about and I decided on the Fettuccine with Tomato Compote and Kalamata Olives (which I wasn't too sure about when I ordered, but was SO glad I did, because it was delicious and under 600 calories!) Our 3 year old had the kid's pepperoni pizza which was delicious and more than enough for him (and such a steal at that price point!)
We finished off with a free birthday dessert (thank you Brio for taking that extra step for us!), and the kiddo enjoyed his kid's ice cream sundae.

Our server was wonderful, he was friendly, attentive (but not hovering), and made our dinner extra special. We truly appreciate the wonderful customer service and delicious food to boot. Thanks Brio!. Absolutely delicious. Chicken was so flavorful. Highly recommend the avocado quinoa. Just discovered this place but we will be back. Loved the variety of healthier options.. I'm ecstatic to have this delicious culinary spot off Shea (and right by my house)! The goat cheese and date bruschetta was amazing. We had the arugula and pear salad and their sausage, pepperoni, and proscuitto pizza... YUM! The service was great and the ambience was modern/rustic chic. I really enjoyed this new neighborhood hot spot and next time I want to try the prosciotto burger. Urban Italian never tasted so good.. I booked a table for 4 people recently based on a recommendation from a friend - i seemed to be the last person in Edinburgh to find out Oloroso had closed down and was replaced with a Thai restaurant! (not that I frequented Oloroso often as it was pretty much out of my 'normal' dining budget). However, my friend promised me the prices were 'ok' so off I trotted....

WOW.

The food was exceptional and as beautifully presented as you would expect in a top quality Thai restaurant. The service was too good at times (can I say that?) - slightly too attentive. I mean, argh! leave my wine glass alone! However this is the Thai culture of providing the best service possible where 'the customer is king' so I can't really fault it.

The prices were pretty reasonable as was the wine list, which was also quite extensive. The cocktail bar we were offered a seat in after our meal was a nice touch and very convenient whilst we debated where to go next. Ambiance and decor - lovely. It'll be lovely in the summer for some al fresco dining.

A definite 5 star recommend from me and I'd go back in a heart beat.. Have been going there for 2 years or so, Jazzi is the best, my dog loves going there and she is always so excited when we get there. Would recommend them to anyone.. All the food is great.. We had sliders, calamari, tacos, and some type of bruschetta w/meat.. Love a late night here, although I wish the entertainment was more than just watching the mechanical bull riding or t.v.'s. The bartenders are awesome and fun, although my drink size varies on whether I'm with my girlfriends or boyfriend.They make a great electric lemonade. Wish they had live music, dancing, etcetera.. This is in my opinion the best Station Casino Feast buffet. Came here with friends to celebrate a friends birthday.   I've been here in the past & it was poor. Cold food & old food used to sit. 

Today we came in for the Saturday night dinner. It was much better than the last visits I remember.   I saw that they have cook to order burgers & Philly Cheese Steaks. Yummy!  Glad we used or 2 for 1's here instead of Red Rock... 1ST STAY: Sunday, February 1, 2009 - Wednesday, February 4, 2009 - [3 NIGHTS]
2ND STAY: Friday, April 6, 2012 - Sunday, April 8, 2012 - [2 NIGHTS]

::::: [ THE ROOMS AT THE HRH TOWER - 4.5/5 ] :::::

Aside from the very first time I visited the Hard Rock, I've been staying at the HRH Tower - twice at the KING SUITE, and once at the SUPREME CORNER KING SUITE. 

Both are beautiful rooms, complete with a separate living and sleeping area, split up by a divider that has a 40" LCD TV mounted on each side. The interior is contemporary with light colors and shades of beige, ivory, gray, and natural tones. In the bedroom, there's also a touch screen jukebox with an iPod dock. Too bad it's not compatible with Spotify. :-/ Another bonus is the blackout drapes.. which for me means better sleep. The bathroom is spacious, with a deep tub and a separate shower.

This hotel is off the strip, so it really wouldn't make sense to stay there unless you have a car. They do have a shuttle service, but it's really not the most reliable thing.


::::: [ THE POOL - 4/5 ] :::::

The pool here is pretty epic. If you're staying here, you really should take a moment to check it out at least once. Of course, it's more of a place to generally relax and/or socialize than to "swim."

The Hard Rock Hotel in Bali also has a pool with sand in it, but it's minuscule in comparison.


::::: [ THE CASINO - 3/5 ] :::::

The casino is just okay. The payouts at the tables aren't great, and the machines are pretty standard. 

Still, staying at the hotel does mean I usually end up playing at least 15mins or so per day at the casino... especially since the hubby sleeps a whole lot more than I do.


::::: [ THE RESTAURANTS - 3.5/5 ] :::::

               * NOBU: I haven't been to this specific NOBU, but I've found that all of the Nobu branches tend to be pretty reliable and consistently high in terms of quality. I do recommend making reservations ahead of time if you plan to dine here.
               * PINK TACO: Haven't tried it, so I can't tell you if all the attention this place gets is based on hype, price, convenience, or if they really do serve great food.
               * MR LUCKY'S: The food is pretty mediocre. It's open 24/7 so it may prove to be a convenient stop sometimes. For those of you who love a bargain, they offer a "Gambler's Special" for $7.77 that includes a salad, an 8oz sirloin, 3 jumbo shrimp, and a side of garlic mashed potatoes. Do keep your expectations realistically low with regards to quality and flavor, though.

NOTE: If you're one of those people who like to check out the HARD ROCK CAFE at every city you visit (like my Dad), then keep in mind that the Hard Rock Cafe Las Vegas isn't actually located inside the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas. It's on the strip.

___________________________________

CHERRY ON TOP: Don't forget to tip at check-in. ;-). Filled up the gas at Rebel on the way to returning the car before flight back to OAK.

This might be the cheapest gas around the rental car place, under 10 miles at least.

Cash sign said $2.52, but you don't see the Credit price until you pump.  It was $2.57 which is only 5c more per gallon.. I went here for lunch with a g/f.  I had their sushi sampler and she got their Bama Roll with a house salad.  Both were excellent.  The house salad is a wonderful mix of freshness with the lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber and the light onion and soy dressing and richness with the generous touch of bleu cheese.  The sushi was all fresh and really good.  It was a tad more expensive than I generally pay for lunch but, I would go back.. Although it is a bit loud and the patrons are more casual than a steakhouse normally calls for, the food and service is impressive. 

Lamb = 5 stars
Aged NY strip steak =5 stars
Potatoes/asparagus/broccoli = 3 stars for lacking flavor. Great place to stay they treat you good good food good music only place there I will stay in it's on the strip. Long awaited dining experience!!
Scenic View. Impeccable service.
Arrived and seated in a timely manner.
The entire staff was overly accommodating and the atmosphere was both ambient without being too romantic of a setting for two.

Made it easy by handing over $300 and having the server pick out our entire six course meal. We are industry, so I am sure we we taken care of beyond that.

Yellowtail Sashimi
Risotto
Spighetti 
A delicious creamy truffle soup dish
Halibut
And lastly and Meat/steak dish which I was too stuffed to finish.

Topped the mean off with chocolate soufflé  and and parfait/sorbet desserts. 

Oh and I had a glass of Cabernet chosen my our server and "if you see kay" 

Wonderful Experience. I love Ikea! Always lots of stuff to choose from and see as well as great ideas. They have a kids play area where the kids can get dropped off at for a couple hours which is kinda nice. Be careful what day you go though because it can get extremely busy on weekends and it's very difficult to shop and check-out lines are ridiculous. However, during the week you can take your time and it's very enjoyable. Also the food it pretty good.. The staff is absolutely friendly. It's like home!!! The fish is very fresh and they can make anything you want. The selection of sake is pretty big, the price are not bad and you don't have to wait forever to get your food. I highly recommend.. I am so impressed with the Trophy Den. I will never go anywhere else to get any of my trophy, awards or plaque needs met. I had an urgent trophy need met today, the day before Thanksgiving. They were so helpful. They helped me pick something out and then they took care of it and it was ready within hours. It was also less expensive than any of the full prices I found online. I will only use the Trophy Den moving forward. Plus they've been local since 1968.. So impressed by how well my carpets looked!
in the past I was always disappointed with the experience.
Brian has great people skills and will go the extra mile to explain
everything he is doing as well as what you need and do not. 
He does not try to upsale at all either. 
Do yourself a favor and choose his company for all your carpet and tile needs!!. I.Love.This.Place. I have sampled a few items from the menu: a few of the Hot Stone Rice Bowls, the Bulgogi Stew, the Rice Dumpling Soup, the classic Bulgogi and some sushi. Everything has been so flavorful, and the portions are very generous. The staff there is always attentive and very friendly! Also, the kimchi is some of the best I've had. Just.go.. They have new york style chow mein! I have been looking for a place that serves this for years. They have fast delivery and great crab puffs and fried rice too. :). Awesome food and ambiance; a real live neighborhood Cheers bar! I can't imagine being the least bit dissatisfied! The food is home-made from old world family recipes ; everything from rice pudding to beer batter fish with the special coleslaw ! Great atmosphere and ambiance. The owner is a gem; sincere , generous and great conversationalist. Not a bad singing voice either! Don't be surprised if a good old fashioned sing along in three part harmony breaks out- join in!. Been to Nando's at least 25 times.  Both the big restaurant and the "Hideaway" for breakfast.  I always see the same employees, people are always friendly and fast.  I love the happy hour food -- the mexican Pizza is awesome.  I love the beans, the enchiladas, the chips, the salsa.  The house margaritas are strong and delicious.  Yes, the food is cheesy and Americanized but it is delicious!  I have rarely seen such consistency in a restaurant.  This place will be around for a long time.  Excellent management and organization.. 2:00 pm, Saturday in Las Vegas.  You wake up, finally, and realize that your intense inebriation from Friday night has been replaced with a hankering for some good food.  This is me a few weekends ago.  

I was supposed to wake up and go to Bouchon in the morning to get a fancy breakfast, but somehow that didn't happen.  I even told my friends I would meet them there.  Sleep prevailed for a few more hours.  When my friends got back from their breakfast, I was hungry for lunch.  As we ventured to explore the new Cosmopolitan Hotel, Holsteins immediately caught my eye... well the pink cow in front sure did.  The modern feel and fun music drew us in. 

The menu has a bunch of fun items to choose from.  Their list of burgers is amazing.  Delicious meaty burgers.  They also had a great selection of alcoholic shakes (Bam-Boozled Shakes) and some cute flavored shots.  They also have plenty of beer and wine.  The ultimate burger spot I'd say.

I decided to get the Rising Sun.  It was a Kobe beef burger with Teriyaki glaze, furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado.  This was recommended from the waitress as her favorite burger.  It was honestly quite salty but it was really good.  The best part was the tempura avocado.  We also tried the Korean Bull-gogi.  That came with an over easy egg, kim chee, and kalbi glaze.  This burger was not as salty and also very good.  The Kobe beef of the Rising Sun made that burger super moist though.

To drink we shared the Oreo shake, which had Bailey's Irish Cream in it.  Make sure that you finish it cold because a luke-warm alcoholic shake is not so good.  The Bailey's was really good and just barely noticeable, except when I felt my the heat in my face.  It is kinda pricey for a shake though $11.

I would definitely come back to get some yummay burgers next time I am in LV... which I hope is soon!. Here's to my second time in Vegas and my first time at PH. I must say this place is great, definitely almost number one if it wasn't for the new neighbor Cosmopolitan to steal their shine. Sure there's plenty of other beautiful hotels to stay at but PH is soooo convenient. The mall is just a few steps away from the Casino as well as PF Changs and Yolos. The pool is maybe not the best looking one on the strip but it is so much fun. To top it off its not even on the haunted list unlike most hotels nearby.  I can not wait to be back in two weeks however this time I'll be at the PH westgate's presidential suite. Yay for me!. Our Garmin lead us through a very sketchy neighborhood to get here.  We were just about to turn back when we noticed the area got a bit more hipster.  Figuring that I could beat the plaid & mustache out of anyone who tried to do anything ironic to my car, we decided to go in.

So glad we did!  This was the best Thai food I've ever had.  The seafood was tender, the peanut chicken curry was well balanced and the summer rolls were tender and delicious.

A word of caution.  Order a little less spicy than you think you should.  They are judging heat by Thai standards, not by my pallid tongue.. Get there.  Go on.  What are you waiting for?  GO.. Yum - Rita's is italian ice with "custard" soft serve in it.  The italian ice comes in dozens of flavors and the fruit ones often have real chunks of fruit in them.

I'm a big fan of chocolate custard with black cherry ice.  The vanilla custard goes well with a citrus or fruity ice.  I think the cream ices are an abomination, but that's just personal taste.

There are also many many Rita's locations, aside from this one on Forbes. I stopped by the herb box just to grab drinks with a few friends.  The restaurant's decor is nice.  It hasn't changed that much since it was the estate house though.  But I liked it then too!  It looks perfect for outdoor eating.  The bartender was very nice and took pictures of the group for us along with others from the staff.  My friend was very excited at how nice the bathrooms are! LOL.. Hands down FIVE STARS!

I'm so in love with this place. Everything was perfect.

I came here with my boyfriend on Thursday morning. We got there ten minutes early so we waited for the doors to open. Lucky us, we were the first customers!

Service:
Normally I'm used to people being a little cranky or annoyed when customers show up when the place just opens since they're not fully ready yet, but it wasn't like that all all here. I mean, except for the hostess. She wasn't mean or anything but I did detect a little attitude and she didn't see all that friendly. She asked my boyfriend for his name, which I didn't understand at all. There was no one else even coming in the restaurant and it's not like she looked for a reservation so I thought that was weird. 

Our server was awesome though! I don't have a single complaint about him at all. He was totally on top of everything. Once he sat us he took our drink orders, suggested the guacamole then brought us our freshly made appetizer once it was done and the drinks. Then took our order and brought it right away. He always kept checking up on us too even though he got more customers. I notice that a lot of servers tend to stop checking up on you if they get more customers because they're just soo busy, but he didn't at all, he was always making sure we had everything we need and always made sure our cups and the basket of chips were filled. If we weren't so full we would've ordered the churros he suggested because, as my boyfriend described,  they sounded very enticing !

Food:
My coffee was freshly brewed and they put a hint of cinnamon in it which I thought I wouldn't like, but it turned out to be sooo good! The guacamole was out of this world! So fresh, so chunky, and ooh so yummy! Definitely the best guac I have had in a very long time. The chips also came with 3 different salsas which were mild medium and hot. You could definitely tell the levels and different tastes of each one which is seldom in a lot of restaurants. We ordered the tacos since it's the only thing on the menu that says it comes with rice and beans which is what we wanted. The tacos were freakin' BOMB! Omg they were so good! The carne asada was very tender and juicy and the sweet/spicy sauce was killer! The chicken tinga tacos were even better! They seriously took me to heaven, mmmm. The portions were perfect. I'm so used to going to Mexican restaurants and having them just fill the plate with their watery refried beans and and soggy rice, but this place totally didn't do that. It's like they pre measured my waist and figured out what portion would be just right. I looved it. I didn't walk out with my pants all unbuttoned and my stomach all bloated. The food was just awesome, I can't wait to try the churros and another plate! 

Ambiance:
The interior of this place was so cool! It's like i got socked in the face and saw little stars floating around me and everything in different colors. It was seriously so nice. I loved it! My boyfriend and I even want to decorate one of the rooms in our house like that in the future. The way that the booths were set up were so you could see the whole restaurant around you, soo nice! Next time I definitely want to sit outdoors at night, I saw that they had fireplaces! It must be really nice to come here at night because the ambiance is so beautiful. 

I can't wait to come here again :D. OK, now this is good clean fun!  This weekend featured Dog Day where, yes, I could bring the pooch to the game.  Great beer options, all $3.50 to $4.50 per cup.  TIckets are cheap and the goofy antics are fun.  The Cheese and Burger Society offers a different signature burger for each game.  I even found something called a Pigsicle -- smoked bacon on a stick, deep fried, served plain or with chocolate.  $1.. OK, for starters...  I have always wanted to stay at the Luxor since its construction.  It's a pyramid, for Chrissakes.  

We really enjoyed our room.  It was kind of on a corner, so we had a large tub in a tiled area under the window/slanted pyramid wall.  The interior of the rooms wasn't overly Egyptian; just some hieroglyphics on the wardrobe and a large stone-type "artifact" on the wall.  Other than the slanted walls near the windows, it could have been a typical hotel room anywhere.  The room was very clean and had lots of storage space as well as plenty of furniture (couch, chairs, tables, extra sitting room).  

The casino was always moderately busy, but I never had trouble finding a machine in the denomination I wanted (given I was there during the week, I wasn't surprised).   We did dislike Centro Bar and Helen, the incredibly crabby bartender who treated us like absolute dirt... and we were paying cash, not using a coupon.  Sorry we bothered you, Helen.  

We ate at Rice & Company and absolutely loved our food.  He had the shrimp fried rice, and I had the ahi tuna salad and some salmon rolls.  Excellent quality and service.   

We also were married at the Chapel at Luxor.  They have a variety of packages and were happy to accomodate us midweek (when they're not that booked).  It was incredibly easy coordinating the ceremony and my salon services at Nurture.  Thanks to Darcy, Thong, Laura, and Maria @ Nurture for your help making me look great!  :). I was first introduced to Thai Basil on a date (the location on University). I don't know if it was the food or the company but I had a fantastic time and have been with that very same boy for over 2 years now :-) Good first date choice, Sean R! We probably get take out/dine in at Thai Basil once every week or two. When the new location (within walking distance of home) opened up on Rural I was ecstatic. The owners/waitstaff are always warm, friendly, and inviting. The restaurant is cozy, dark and intimate and the food is amazing with killer prices. I can't begin to describe how much I love Thai food. My favorite dishes are the Thai Basil with chicken or shrimp, Garlic chicken or shrimp, the Red Curry chicken, and the Coconut soup (soooo good!). The spring rolls are amazing as well. I have never had a bad experience...in fact, I think I'll get takeout from Thai Basil this evening, it just sounds so good writing about it!. Amazing show!!! This is my second cirque de soile show and it won't be my last!! Amazing acts my husband and I really enjoyed it!! I just wish they had more drink selections.. I kinda dig this place. Tasty $17 all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ... sign me up! 

The price is right and the meats are better than you'd expect.  Pretty good, actually!  They have galbi (ribs), and bulgogi (thinly  sliced beef) and oh jing oh (squid), and shrimp and and and... a selection of prepared foods and some sushi.  I've been here a few times now and am always glad I came to eat.  Last time, I was with a big group of friends (about 10) and everyone liked it.  Just know that you'll smell like Korean bbq for the rest of the day, unless you head home to take a shower afterwards.  :)

See ya there!. I can't even begin to describe our experience here. I've been to plenty of Morton's Anaheim, Beverly Hills, Santa Ana, downtown LA I've even tried the New York location but this is by far the BEST location I've been to. 

Service: where do I start, when paying a nice amount of money you expect a great level of service. From the host to the bartenders while waiting to get seating to our waiter and the manager there is great management here and you can tell by the way the employees work. EVERYONE including the manager were on top of all their guest. There was someone constantly refilling our drinks without asking which made this experience even better. Something so simple yet not a lot of restaurants master it. Our waiter was pleasant and polite. The manager was very professional and the whole staff was managed very well.

Food: this last Thursday we went to Mastros it wast first time and coming here tonight made me realize why I'm so loyal to Morton's! We ordered a filet mignon with the Alexander jumbo shrimp, for the sides we ordered the masked potatoes and the macaroni and cheese. We started our meal with some amazing bread and moved on to the chopped spinach salad and last but not least... The chocolate lava cake.... To DIE for!

Kudos to this amazing restaurant! Amazing chefs and employees!. I used to shop at Glaziers all the time a few years ago, when I lived in the Silverado Ranch area.  I recall they always seemed to have good deals, and good produce.

This weekend, for the 4th of July, my fella and I stopped in to take a look at their meat selection for a "grill off" competition we were participating in.  

First of all, what a selection in their seafood department!!  A huge slab of yellowtail Tuna (although I heard from another Yelper that this was not really good), HUGE shrimp that looked amazing, lobster tails, king crab clusters (not just the legs), and monkfish!  I've never seen monkfish anywhere, and at $7 a pound, we got 4 pieces and had a delightful lunch.

We also found veal chops, which my fella and I had never seen before.  The chops were about an inch thick, so we asked the guys behind the counter if they could do a custom cut (inch and a half) for us.  They were more than happy to, showing us the meat and where it would be cut prior to doing it.  

This right here is what makes me prefer Glazier's over Smith's.  At Smith's, the guys working the meat department are high school kids who don't know what a Cowboy cut is.  These guys actually KNOW what they are doing, and they know about the meat, the different cuts, etc.  

I am definitely thinking that we will start shopping here more frequently again.  

The produce looked great, and we picked up broccolini and endive, which I haven't seen in many other stores.. Best cheap meal in Vegas! 

Open 24 hours in the Planet Hollywood Casino, this place serves up a GOOD sandwich. The line runs pretty quickly during the day, and sandwiches run about $7. I ordered the Full Montagu and it was freaking delicious! I don't like mustard so I asked for it on the side but their mustard was pretty tasty! The tomato soup was super creamy and yummy as well. 

Next time you hit up Vegas, you gotta try this sandwich! It's so much better than the McDonald's alternative!. Sooo good! Fantastic cheese! Great salsa. But the cheese...... SOOOOOOOO DELICIOUS!. I stayed at this hotel the same time I would guess as T G. I understand if you know the chain and hate the colors why you might not like it but I found the rooms clean and beds comfortable. What gets the Full star rating is the service provided. The valets always asked if I needed directions or ideas for activities. Every day Jordan greeted us at desk by name and Insured we were prepared with ideas for the day. Every person working the desk said hello and made eye contact as soon as the front door opened. The whiskey bar was great. Flights of whiskey to try, specialty drinks, duck fat fries all great. Bartender John was very happy to talk anyone sitting at the bar through how he was mixing very involved drinks. All the waitstaff and bartenders there took just enough time with the patrons so no one was ignored. Because rooms were still needing some finishing touches breakfast was free everyday. Again charm was found all through the hotel if you looked at the hard working staff who took time to insure our stay was memorable.. I absolutely loved this place! 

We had made reservations our first visit. Even though we were early and it was getting packed, they let us in before our time. 

I ordered a whole lobster (which my husband ate half) and it was delicious. I forgot what he ordered but he was drunker than hell! It didn't matter how drunk he was they tolerated it better than most restaurants I've been to. 

I can't wait to go back there again...plus they don't skimp on the alcohol.. Yum!!! Burger's a little wimpy, so I'd get 2 patties next time. Turtle sundae is to die for!!. Soooo delicious!  We always get the mixed plate with Chicken Katsu, and beef teriyaki.  The kalbi short ribs are delicious as well.  Highly recommended!. Absolutely love this place! One of my favorite coffee shops. The people who work here are so friendly, helpful, and make you feel like you are at home. The drinks are very delicious. I love their tea latte that is pressed. They use actual tea leaves and after a few minutes add some love such as real vanilla to make the ends result absolutely wonderful. Best chai tea I have ever had! The chairs are very comfortable too. I can sit in them all day. This is a great spot for some family time, to chill, and to study. They even have a drive through.. I struggled with the decision of four of five stars ... I decided to go with four because while I LOVED the food here, it fell down in one or two places.

I went here with my man this past summer, when is was so excruciatingly hot (remember that weekend?) that we spent most of our time laying around complaining, and drinking cold beer.  My guy went for a meal with one of his buddies here a couple of weeks prior and raved about it so much that I forced him to take me one evening when we were able to peel ourselves off the floor.
He reported that the beers were quite pricey so we opted for a bottle of white wine.  The white wine selection was pretty limited and not cheap (we ordered the cheapest bottle at something like £15.00), and I regret to say that we were most assuredly not impressed with our choice.  

Our food, however, more than made up for it.  I love tapas because I love variety.  We ordered three or four dishes each and enjoyed every bite.  I would love to go into detail but have a memory like a sieve and can't remember what we ordered off the top of my head.  I would be pretty confident, though, that anything you order here will be grat.    

The problem with Dionika is that no one ever goes here.  I honestly don't know how they survive.  I have NEVER seen it full.  It's one of those things where people don't go there because it's always empty, but of course it's always empty because no one goes there.  

We keep wanting to go back but walk by and it's so dead that we decide to go somewhere else.  I think maybe everyone who likes this place need to agree on a night to go there so we can have great food AND good atmosphere!

One other oddity - at the end of our meal the owner/chef came out and made his chatty round of the dining room (all three tables).  He was very spirited and certainly loves his restaurant.  He was a bit eccentric, but gave us complimentary booze so our hearts were won over.

Edit:  I forgot to mention that the meal (including 15 pounds for a bottle of wine) was 40 pounds.  I thought it was a major bargain.. The thing that I love about Hakkasan is that they were very thoughtful in their table placement and size.  I would say there aren't many tables that can be pinned as "awful" in this space, and as an independent VIP host, that's important.  My client who may be doing a low minimum will be satisfied with his table even though he's not sitting on the dancefloor table because all of the tables are great.  The rooms are beautiful and the design is top notch.  I personally love this venue.. Love this place! I've been coming to this location for about 6 months. I was lucky enough to get my first appointment with Lyssa, who is amazing, and since then I won't get my eyebrows done anywhere or by anyone else! She goes out of her way to make sure my eyebrows look perfect, even though I've been told my eyebrows are super difficult to wax. I was so impressed with my first visit, I purchased the unlimited package right away that day. I love the atmosphere at this European wax center location and it's always super convenient to get an appointment.. Took my cat to Coolidge Veterinary Hospital today for the first time.  The staff was friendly and efficient and loved Dr. Woods!  I was most impressed and will be taking the rest of our pets there too!. Holy crap, my gluten free friends, Mellow Mushroom has entered the fray with a thoroughly credible gluten-free pizza for our delicate sensibilities. I have a low tolerance for bad pizza, having grown up in the Midwest within a stone's throw of Papa Del's, and I had forgotten how good the Mellow Mushroom actually is. It comes down to the sauce and the creative combinations of flavors. The gluten free crust holds up to being held in your hand and has a good texture. I ordered the Kosmic Karma. It's big enough for two and the toppings are fabulous.. Jaime C showed up right on time and was able to explain everything that was wrong with our downstairs toilet. We were very satisfied not only with his professionalism but the company as well. It was very easy to schedule an appointment and they were in communication with me on the day of service as well. Highly recommend Mr. Rooter.. Great and fast place to get an perfect eyebrow waxing!. I went here for a large get together over the weekend. Our waitress was really great considering the large, drunk group. :) 

The only thing I didn't like was the lack of fountain diet coke. It came in a cute mexican glass bottle but i prefer my diet coke to come from a fountain. I'm crazy like that. Other than that, the glass did pour me 3 refills which was PLENTY so i didn't feel jipped......except by the lack of extra bubbles that comes from a fountain cola, but i digress.

I had this amazing salad. it had artichoke hearts, pine nuts, onions, mozarella, and leafy greens. top notch. everyone elses food looked amazing too. especially that damn hotdog. i wish they had a few more menu options unrelated to sandwiches or salads, but i definitely recommend. super good.. Thanks to Yelp, I found a coffee shop that serves Almond Milk! I really liked my Vanilla Almond Milk Latte. Will be coming back when I have more time to peruse the bookshelves filled with sci-fi and again, try not be tempted to run out the door with all the cool Star Wars toys they have as décor.. Seriously the best boba in Las Vegas!!! Love their Jasmine-Green Tea (unsweetened) with boba. Especially cause their boba has a hint of honey... Ahhh, it's perfection.. One of the best Tattoo places I have ever been to. I have 7 tattoos and Frank Singer did 4 of them. He is a fantastic artist!! This place is very clean. Everyone is very friendly and helpful! I have a few more that I want Frank to do.. it's just finding the time. Hope they are here for a long time!. I was here after 6:30 pm on Friday to hang out for dinner and a drink after a long day at work. I sat at the bar - where the nice bartender named ? Chris ? made me what he said was a more orignial version of a "sex on the beach". It was good, and I drank it quickly before ordering the half off appetizer "guacamole". When it came out, it was probably more than I should have eaten alone, but it was REALLY tasty and much better than most places who dont know how to make a good guac.

Next I ordered my usual, a Madris. Since this was happy hour - my drinks were super cheap too - but I dont know the exact price. I came in there to order the Enchiladas Del Mar - but after my guacamole appetizer, I was a little too full so I will definately be getting it next time. I DID order the fried ice cream - and Oh My Gawsh! It was amazing. The strawberry sauce was perfect with it, it wasnt OVERLY sweet but since I'm a desert junkie - it was just my style. I have a friend there whos a server and waited around for her until they got off and we still stayed there after her shift ended. Thats how fun this place is. The other serers there are super sweet too - not bitches like the girls at Hooters seemed to be.  :)

After a certain time they have a live DJ and he was pretty awesome too. 

I WILL be back, more than once. And i'm getting my enchiladas this time!! :)

Oh - and my total was only lke 15 bucks after all that too. I had about 5 drinks over the whole night. Cant beat that!. It was Charlotte Restaurant Week, so it still took us 20 minutes to be seated with a reservation... The hostess was pleasant, so it didn't put me in a bad mood... Our server was funny, attentive and knowledgeable... I love the wine list because you can order by bin number and not have to stumble your way through an order... (I can recognize a brand and a label but I am horrible at pronouncing some of the names... lol) The Caesar salad had just the right amount of dressing... I don't normally eat shrimp, but the ones that came with this NY strip steak were phenomenal... The steak itself was also very well prepared... I ordered it medium well and that is exactly how it came to the table... Just the slightest bit of pink and a nice texture... The mashed potatoes were pretty good and the vegetables were just basic... Luckily my boyf doesn't eat desserts, so I always get to try at least two for CRW... Last night's options were a Bananas Foster bread pudding and a chocolate mousse... I couldn't really get down with the bread pudding, but my friend seemed to love it... The mousse was a great way to end the meal, though!. Salad, salad and more salad!. Doubting my ability to bear the 10 degree weather for an extended period of time, I carefully bundled myself in about 8 layers of clothes and embarked on my quest up the mountain. Only to realize that in hiking up a mountain, one becomes quite toasty, and thus it's fairly unnecessary to wear every sweater and coat you own.  

I've only been during the winter, but it was an amazing hike with ridiculously rewarding views at the top. Except for the red "s" that is so prominent from almost every viewpoint (see pics). Really though, it's a winter wonderland.

Super fun to slip and slide down the closed staircases. I'm pretty sure the whole park would be closed in the US for fear of crazy lawsuits. Props to Canada for keeping it open and trusting people to use decent judgment. Or, if you're like me, use poor judgment but blame it on yourself if anything bad happens. 

Can't wait to return this summer and see how it is when it's warm outside.. While visiting Glendale,  I stumbled into this lovely cafe. The owner is fantastic and so welcoming. For my first meal, I ordered the turkey avocado sandwich and I added bacon. It was delicious and the bread toasted with Parmesan butter was a nice touch. On my second trip to this restaurant, I ordered a breakfast sandwich and iced coffee. I love that the breakfast menu allows for custom orders.. I probably should write a review, since apparently I'm the restaurant's profile picture right now (oh dear).

The prices for dinner items are a little more expensive than the hole-in-the-wall establishment that I expected when we pulled up to this Mexican joint.  That's probably because the vast majority of the dishes are seafood related.  There are non-seafood items, especially on the lunch menu, but seafood is definitely the special of the house (bahia means bay).

So, of course, I made the mistake of ordering a non-seafood dish.  Luckily it wasn't a horrible mistake - my cheese enchiladas were filling, had decent flavor, and were, best of all, cheap.  However, I'm sure the seafood here is spectacular, and I broke my own rule and didn't order the house specialty.  My horchata, on the other hand, was absolutely delicious.

Service was great as well.  When the chef sent out beef enchiladas (not an item on the $7 lunch menu) instead of my cheap version, the waitress apologized profusely and offered to let me have it if I'd like.  The bus-boy was a cute 10 year old wearing a walkman.  Obviously an authentic family-run establishment.

Stop by if you're in the area - it's better than those buffet places that the nearby DMV is advertising!. Food is excellent!!  I have been there over fifteen times and never had a meal that wasn't amazing.  You have to get the table-side guacamole, street corn and a Mission Margarita!. Truly amazing. I've stayed quite a few placed on the strip, this was our first time at the Wynn. I don't know how I'll ever stay at another hotel. Ask for an upgrade when you check in, they offered us a GREAT suite with Panoramic views of the strip for only $40 more per night. Truly worth it. This hotel is much pricier than the rest, but it's for a good reason! Everything was clean, fresh flowers everywhere. Service was super.. I love, love, love the spinach salad!!! So much vibrant flavor! Yum! Good service, friendly staff! Great vegan food, which is so hard to find. We try to eat here several times whenever we visit Las Vegas. Sometimes it's our first stop in town!. I was pleasantly surprised with this place. All the people that mentioned it to me were LDS and I am not so I wasn't sure what to expect from "good clean comedy." My husband and I actually went with an LDS couple on a double date (see, we don't hate!) and they chose this place. Otherwise, we most likely would not have come here on our own. Anyways, I was stunned with some of the ingenious things the Improv group came up with. Honestly was cracking up almost the entire time with the exception of when the one and only girl was up. She was not funny at all. However, there was a guy with blonde hair and glasses that was hilarious! Anyways, I loved this place and would definitely go again. Whats also nice is that its only 12.00 which is quite a difference from the Improv where you pay 20.00 usually for the tickets and have to buy 2 items each as well. Don't get me wrong, I do love the Improv but if you are looking for cheaper and cleaner comedy, then this is your place.. I give Thunder from Down Under 5 stars because of the dudes are Australian and because they actually are a lot hotter than the guys at Chippendales. I got to shake one of the guys hands and as my friend put it, "He's going around shaking people's hands like he thinks he's Jesus." He wasn't Jesus, but he was pretty much shaped like a god. You like that one? 

I want to say that they really are all Australian, but now that I think about it, I was too distracted by all of the skin and muscles to notice if they all had accents. I know that some of them did...

There is a self serve bar in the back, lots of seating (try and book a table towards the front, we were on the second level and we didn't get as much lovin' from the Aussies), and it costs $20 per person to get your picture taken with them after the show. They're pretty cute up close and totally yoked, so like I said, 5 stars.. RnR ROCKS!!! This place never disappoints. From the food & drinks to the staff and vibe. I've been on crowded days and random weekdays. Just recently went and was undecided on what to eat. Joe was the best server EVER. Super knowledgeable of the food and drink menu. Pretty much asked me what I felt like and he created my own personal  pairings. It was the best. Everything he suggested was amazing just like the service he provided. I frequent AZ for work and family, so anytime clients or friends ask me where they should grab a drink or eat...I tell them to see JOE @ RNR!!. I can forgive this place for not having prime rib that one time.  But when you have your heart set on something and they don't have it, it is pretty disappointing.  I have dined here three times since that incident where they ran out of prime rib.  And each of those three times that I dined here have been wonderful.  Staff has been friendly and food is incredibly delicious for the price you pay.  I would for sure choose this place over Lawry's any day as the food is just as good and for a fraction of the price. The Prime Rib Loft is definitely an awesome place for prime rib and the overall value is outstanding!. lovely casual place. but the wifi didn't work for me.
bummer that crepes are only served for breakfast!!! till 11.30am. 
salads looked huge.

sandwiches are delicious. thanks to the lady's recommendation, i ordered the chicken avocado & arugula.THE BREAD. omgosh. hello there. soft not overbearing. scrumptious by itself or with the sandwich. give me more please. it also came with a small side of quinoa mixed with cucumbers, dressing, red cabbage, etc.. Somehow I have lived in Charlotte for almost 6 months and just realized that Mac's is less than 10 minutes from my house.  

We visited Mac's on a Thursday evening and were intimidated by all the cars in the parking lot when we pulled in. We almost changed our minds.  I was expecting a wait, but we were seated right away and there were other empty tables.  I think the crowd on the patio accounted for a lot of the cars.

Overall, our experience was great.  Good service and the food came super quick (as it should in bbq place).  We ordered the fried pickles for an appetizer.  I somehow neglected to read the part about spicy in the menu.  They aren't kidding!  They have a kick.  Don't really care for spicy food, but they were good - and I was warned after all.  Homemade ranch was tasty.

Hubs ordered the half smoked chicken and it was perfection.  So awesome.  Beans and fries were tasty sides.  I ordered a veggie plate with green bean casserole, super awesome mac n cheese and onion rings.  I found the onion rings too spicy - wondering if I missed that warning too - but hubs liked them.  Everything was just super tasty and the mac n cheese is totally craveable!

I had plenty of plate envy watching the food being delivered around me.  We will be back.

If I have to have a gripe, it would be that our waitress sat down on the booth beside me to take our order and I saw her doing this with other patrons as well.  Maybe I'm weird, but I hate it when waitpersons do this.  Maybe if I've been eating here for years - maybe - maybe - but not with someone you don't know.. Naked Fish would get 5 stars if the service was better.  On busy weekend nights expect to wait for a table if you're a walk-in cause they do reservations and  it's sad standing there and staring at an empty table someone else already reserved.  

Another thing would be that food comes out pretty slow. Even when they're not busy food comes out slow so forget about it on weekend nights. Order all of your sushi quickly and tell the waitress to bring what ever is ready or else you have to wait until they cut up everything and that takes even longer. 

Besides that the sushi is very high quality and they give you nice thick slices of fish. Never had any complaints about the sushi.

Things to try other than sushi:
Rolls are really good too especially dejavu and their lobster roll is GREAT. 

Salmon Skin Salad: lots of crispy skin with fresh veggies

Red bean  ice cream. Best one in vegas. I just hope Home Depot gives John Trevillion employee of the decade! I bought a few duplexes in Phoenix that needed some quick repairs and I was on a tight schedule as I live out of state. John was able to assist me in every department from appliances to paint to gardening. His expertise in all my home needs was a fabulous surprise as I don't normally get good service from Home Depot.
I give 5 stars to John....Home Depot in general not so much. John, I hope you are working this weekend as I am flying in to do a few more projects.. I had my lashes done yesterday. Jenny was so quick. I've had my lashes done at a few different places but she was definitely experienced. The offerings were great and priced perfect (I used a groupon). She wasn't as gentle as I was used to but that was fine with me since I was used to the process. The fullness after less than an hour was amazing. Here's to hoping they last!. Such an interesting concept in a gorgeous new casino on the strip! 

What initially caught my eye were the neon signs on either side of the entrance. One proclaiming "Mexican Food" and the other "Chinese Food". Being a Mexican food junkie, my friend and I saddled up the bar on the Mexican side of the restaurant surrounded by cool Lucha Libre masks. We watched the Mexican women make fresh corn tortillas by hand behind the bar. 

I started with my token order of chips, salsa and guac. Oh..my..God!! The chips were to die for (What is that seasoning?), the salsa had a nice spicy kick and the $12 bowl of guacamole was huge & fresh!

We then split an order of chicken tacos which are small and come ala carte. The corn tortillas were as delicious as they looked! Naturally, I washed it all down with their signature salt margarita which had an amazing lime tasting foam on top.

I can't vouch for the Chinese side of this joint but the whole restaurant was buzzing with energy and I am still dreaming about the food a week later..... This is such a cute and hipster coffee spot in Phoenix! I love that it's open very late and also offers food and drinks (alcohol included). 

I think the only thing that is a little harder is that it is somewhat difficult to find because the entrance is on the back side, not facing the street, and it looks like you're going nowhere because the street side looks closed, and also looks like you're going into the restaurant next door.

Once inside though, it's cute, but a little dungeon-ish. Not too much natural light in this concrete cave of a building. Their americano is pretty bomb, I haven't had any of the lattes but people seem to like their tea based drinks here. 

They also sell roasted beans, and the staff is very knowledgable of all of their products. Recommended!. This location is right by my house, and is very convenient. The staff has always been very polite and helpful here- I have never had any problems with them. There's never been an issue with applying coupons at this location.. We've been waiting to check out Giada's for quite some time and it is everything we expected it to be and more. We had Calamari & Shrimp and the Eggplant Fries for appetizers -- mouthwatering! We shared the Lemon Spaghetti with shrimp -- unbelievable, Branzino for the main course with smashed potatoes & roasted cauliflower on the side and Giada's favorite cookies for dessert -- Cliff, our server, hooked it up! 

Love the photo booth in the lobby while waiting to be seated...smart idea: you don't realize the length of time of waiting to be seated because it's such a fun distraction. 
Hostess was very welcoming.

Cliff was absolutely delightful! Cliff & his service crew was impeccable! ...the food was amazing (Giada doesn't disappoint, which we had no doubt it would) but there is nothing like having great service along with it! Ask for Cliff, he will take care of you.
We will definitely come back! Everything is to die for -- truly is! Thanks for the wonderful experience!!. This store has everything you need for crafts!!! Great merchandise. Lots of fantastic ideas:))) I love this store!. I came to impact for the first time in July and became sort of a regular. Zoey taught me the basics, and Frank and Charlie are always around to offer tips. And then they started up Archery Tag, which is one of the coolest things I've ever tried, and you can only play it at impact! The other regulars are also super cool and are always up for a challenge, or they'll give you tips to help you improve!  Now that finals are over I'll be back and shooting at my favorite spot in Vegas!!!. This was my first time here, but I will definitely be back.

The prices for specialty Coke drinks and souvenirs was super cheap compared to other shops on the Strip. I bought the Around the World tray for $7, which had 16 different sodas and there was more than enough for me and my boyfriend to try each one at least twice. He even got a Cherry Coke Milkshake for only $2.50. 

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating was because there was little to no seating available. I understand they only have a certain amount of space to work with,  but I had to wait for a couple to leave before I could sit down (mind you, I was holding two trays of soda as I waited). 
I also did not give it the final star because the photos they took of me and my boyfriend were cute, but were $30 for three of them!  

I think it is a very good attraction for locals and tourists alike. It's interesting and worth checking out!. Went in w my birthday email for free pizza.
Waiter was great.  Just had iced tea & soda.  Pizza was delicious as usual
Left tip as if bill had $16 pizza incl
Dont want to short-change staff. This place is wonderful.   I was tipsy from my cocktail so I can't recall exactly what we ate but it was beef and it was fantastic.  We will definitely return.. Getting my toes done, amazing. Convincing my boyfriend to get his toes done with me.... Priceless!



I have come here a few times. They have always done a great job on my toes as well as waxing my eyebrows. They always do great designs on my toes as well!!. Being from Chandler, you went to this place knowing the family or someone that worked there. Now it's SWEETS, and we couldn't be happier! Still great "family" atmosphere. Food is yummy and the ice cream is on point! As a family, the ice cream trips just got better!! Burgers, Chicken strips, soft and hard ice cream! Try it for yourself!! Not to disappoint!. I ordered some takeout from Jamerica, I ordered their Shrimp Mango Rundown.  When I arrived to pick it up, the lady at the counter told me she forgot about my order as she had gotten side tracked.  I had to wait for them to make it which was a little annoying, but none the less the taste made up for my frustration.  Their prices I feel are a little high, but their portions are HUGE. I wish they offered smaller portions at more a reasonable price.. IMO best buffet in Vegas so far.  Wynn is slightly better than Wicken Spoon, which is slightly better than Bellagio.

Pros:
Large selection, esp. for carbs; breads, pastas, pizzas galore
Other stations include Mediterranean (with hummus, baba ghanoush); Italian (pizzas, veggie calzones, pastas/ pasta station); American (prime rib, corn on the cob, cauliflower, candied butternut squash, mashed potatoes); Seafood (king crab legs galore); charcuterie with dried figs and tampenades; Asian (dim sum, noodles, sushi, Japanese salads)
Huge dessert section, including cheesecakes, gelato, mousses,  
Friendly service

Highlights: 
Profiteroles, yum!
Clearly marked vegetarian and vegan offerings; larger selection of meat-free food than other buffets
Delectable salads, esp the heirloom tomato and fresh mozz
Most fresh buffet food so far
Prime rib

Cons:
Mediocre Asian food section: dim sum = steamed cha shiu bao, vegetarian egg rolls, a bit too much like Chinese take-out
Crepes: very soggy and weird chocolate flavor. Ew.
No sugar added desserts- good to offer, but very poor on taste

A definite bonus was that I did not feel incredibly sick afterwards, as I had after the last two buffets I patronized!

Would definitely come back when I"m ready to gain another pant size and spend $48 on food for the day!. One of Edinburgh's best-kept secrets. Cedric has the clock set in the 19th century - except for the electric kettle (Don't get him started on this, he'll tell you!) and the electronic scale for METICULOUSLY measuring your brew. What's on the menu? Cream tea, modern twists on classic cakes, and a mindblowing CATALOGUE of teas. Time stands still in every sense of the word; don't go in a hurry and do spoil yourself to some time out.. The last time I reviewed was during Christmas.  Although the sushi is good, I am a bigger fan of the Avocado/Almond salad.  Yum.. A friend and I decided to stop in for lunch during our conference to get away from the crowds.  We were planning to go to Martorano's, but we got there too late to enjoy lunch.   Hexx seemed like a good option and I was extremely pleased with my selection.  I enjoyed the chicken sandwich - it was messy, but oh so tasty!  This restaurant has great views of the Strip and the Bellagio fountains, the service is great and the decor is comfortable and classy at the same time.. I was very hesitant to get my eyelashes done for a long time. But then I was referred to Yo by a bunch of my coworkers. And her work is amaaaaaazing! She's very meticulous and takes her time to make your eyelashes match to your eye shape. Making them full and natural looking. The quality of the lashes are amazing as well and usually get a fill every 2-3 weeks, depending on how well you take care of them. Getting ready doesn't take me as long which is a plus, because I can just wake up, brush them and head out the door. I highly recommend going to her!. The mr. and I have been here a few times and have nothing but good things to say about the food.  With that said, be prepared to wait for atleast 30 minutes during the busy lunch and dinner rush.  Other reviewers are right, it's a trendy place for hipsters but I love the back part of the resturaunt.. This theater is old but it has the best seats in my opinion. The VIP reserved seats are awesome. Super expensive. Think like 16-18$ but so comfy! I've never eaten here but the other reason I like the VIP seats is that you can bring alcoholic drinks from the bar upstairs into the theater with you. Love! Overall really expensive but I don't go that often so it's worth it. Purchase tickets on fandango ahead of time to avoid lines and just check in at a kiosk.. Their thin pizza is just like my favorite back in Portland, OR.  It tastes just like Escape from New York Pizza. When it's right out of the oven, the cheese oozes and the crust melts in your mouth.  I've had their Philly cheesesteak sandwiches before, but I'd go back for their pizza.  The only downside is that it's surrounded by meter parking and I went here because we were at the Tempe Festival of the Arts and the kids were hungry and I saw the "pizza" sign.  I'm glad I went here. Another patron in front of me was very excited that they sell Tastykake cupcakes and snacks.... Loved. Loved. Loved.
The Hubs and I came here for dinner on our last night, and we were SO happy we found it.  

Everything we had was delish.  We did the prix fixe and we had the escargot, french onion soup, two beef dishes (i forget which ones we got) and ended with the apple pie-ish thing, and the best creme brulee I've ever had.  EVER.  

I can see how in the Summer, when they open up the doors and have the outdoor seating, it would be a great place to have some wine, eat some great food and just hang out.. I love this chick fil a. The customer service is awesome. There are always employees asking if I need anything and making sure I am satisfied. Obviously a great place for kids. The outdoor space and playground is nice and well kept.. This Dels is so different from Denver's and wow am I into it!  We stopped in here for a drink when we couldn't find the place we were trying to go to and it was great.  Incredibly modern and boarder line swanky but it is Phoenix so it works.  Quick service and good drinks.  We didn't eat but I am sure meat eaters would love it!. I came in today to get my husband a new phone, since he's still rockin' the Razor circa 1999 (and pay as you go no less!!).  I did my research and found out he was interested in the Samsung Moment with Google and we could add a data plan on to mine.  Sweeeeeet.

Maybe 30 minutes later I was all set, and the two men working were super friendly and helpful.  You could tell that they do whatever they can to make the customer happy.  Definitely check them out if you're in need of Sprint help!. I enjoyed my coffee Americano, my sister was disappointed in hers.... she's not familiar with African blends ,consecquently, did not like the very light looking coffee or the taste. Very pleasant,attentive staff, very airy, sun-filled  space but limited seating.One can sit here and relax  and just enjoy one's coffee while watching the world go by on a quiet afternoon.. The signature is a great place for families. There are three towers attached too the Mgm grand. We stayed in tower 1 and recommend this one as it is closest to the Mgm grand. The rooms are spacious and we liked having a stove and dishwasher to make some of our own meals
Since we were a large group. Even though things are close there is a lot of walking still. The food court and gambling is close and the pool is also close in tower 2. I would definitely come again!. Getting off early means one thing - HAPPY HOUR!!  And that doesn't happen very often, so I love to take advantage of the cheap eats and atmosphere that happens during these brief few hours.

We arrived around 5 pm and waited a good while to score a table on the patio.  We thought we were in luck when a group of ladies said they were leaving once their friend returned from the restroom.  Well, she must have fell in because it was a good 15 minutes before they did finally leave.  At this point, our total wait time was 45 minutes long.

We were hungry and got our hands on a menu quick!  All food was $5 and under!  With our party of three, we got started on a few items:

* Atlantic Roll "Baked salmon with motoyaki sauce and cucumbers, topped with tempura flakes and eel sauce" ($3) - Our waiter said it was his favorite and I'm not usually one for cooked fish in my rolls, but I still said okay.  It was good, not exceptional though.  Came in eight pieces, which is great for sharing!

* Spicy Tuna Roll "Chopped tuna mixed with spicy motoyaki and cucumbers" ($3) - Again, pretty basic and decent and 8 pieces too.

* Kona Calamari "Served with a spicy aioli dipping sauce" ($4.50) - A pretty generous order, great for sharing.

* Sweet & Spicy Shrimp "Lightly battered shrimp tossed in a sweet and spicy chili sauce, served on a bed of a daikon" ($4.50) - Pretty tasty and surprisingly generous in this order.

* Chicken Satay "With cabbage slaw and sweet hoisin dipping sauce" ($4.50) - Came with four skewers, and a nice slaw to get your veggies from.  A bit dry on the chicken, but enjoyed by others.

* Avocado Egg Roll "Sun-dried tomatoes and red onions, with a honey-cilantro dipping sauce" ($4.50) - Two egg rolls cut in half, and tasty too.

* Kahuna Sliders "A trio of beef sliders seasoned with onions and thyme, topped with Swiss and cheddar cheese" ($4.50) - The Husband enjoyed these so much that he requested another order.  They were pretty good, cooked at medium rare as requested and yummy little things.  The meat was pretty moist and the melted cheese on top made them perfect as a few bites.  They also came with thinly sliced fried onions strings.

* Edamame ($3) - Soybeans that were lightly salted throughout the beans, not just on top.

We didn't even get a chance to try any of their pizzas at $5 each since we ordered so much.

Service was surprisingly good during happy hour.  Christian was attentive, even when the other staff brought our food out, he was quick to come over to make sure it was all okay and everything was in order.  He checked on us often for more drinks and food and we never had to look for him during our entire time there.  Once we got our order in, food came out in timely manner and we were quite pleased.  (Sometimes it seems service gets a bit slack during happy hour, when the pace should be more upbeat.  And it was definitely moving around here.)

Happy hours are Mondays through Fridays: 3 to 7 pm
Reverse happy hours are Mondays through Thursdays: 9 pm to 11 pm
Fridays and Saturdays: 10 pm to 12 am

HH is only available in the lounge and patio areas and seats are self-service.  So it can definitely feel like there are hounds on you when you're hanging out there because people are definitely waiting for tables here.

They have discounted drink specials during happy hour too, just be sure to ask.  We took advantage of their $6.50 Sake Bombs and $3 Ladies Margaritas.  (They weren't skimping on the alcohol in my margarita, I could taste and feel that stuff right away!)

You can easily understand why this happy hour is busy.  And there are some guests who stay there all evening long, it makes for interesting people watching!

Side note: Restrooms are in the back left hand corner.  Don't go to the right side corner because you'll end up in the kitchen.. Vanessa is the best! What I love about her is not only her cuts are amazing, but she really takes the time and LISTENS to what I am asking for! She's, also really great with cutting bangs and for those of you who have bangs its really hard to find someone that does bangs well! Book with her, you wont be disappointed!. I had a new experience today at the market:  a 30-minute wait to check out!  One Windmill Farm had all kinds of produce this week (apples, pears, corn, peppers, tomatoes, eggplant, potatoes...).  I got to the market around 9.15 (two hours earlier than usual, for me) and saw it in full swing.  If you want to avoid the crowds, go later - but there might not be much left.. The best hotel I have stayed in in regards to the cheap price range I was looking for. Comfy beds, good customer service, nice rooms in general, and a really nice hotel atmosphere. The coffee and pho place they have down stairs that is open 24 hours was awesome and they even have shows there at a discount to their guests, which is cheaper than the booths that advertise half off show tickets. the casino was cool although i don't gamble much and although we didn't get to use the pool because it rained just by the looks of it, it looked nice. 

If you stay there you must visit the Tequila bar..... It was my favorite place to drink!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :). I'll be doing my reviews with "Gluten Free" in mind.  I do have Celiac but I am not extremely sensitive to cross contamination and such.  I do stick very closely to the gluten free diet though.

We ate a late dinner at the Grand Lux on Saturday night.  The food was outstanding and the service was fantastic.  They do not have a gluten free menu available, but they will work with you to get you something you'll enjoy.  I ordered the pan roasted chicken.  It was served with awesome mashed potatoes, mashed sweet potatoes and fresh carrots, broccoli and snap peas.  GREAT dinner!!!  We were served by Josh, and he was very friendly and accommodating.  GREAT service also!!!  In the past I have also ordered their vegetable plate, which includes steamed white rice and you choose several side vegetables.

I would highly recommend giving Grand Lux a try, I think you'll have as an enjoyable evening as we did.. Almost every weekend we get nutella crepes & their BLT to go. Not only is the food delicious, but they are always kind & courteous. They even take the time (even though they are always swamped) to open each box to ensure the order is correct. Everyone who knows me, knows I rave about Babystacks. Highly recommend!. Still the creme de la creme in my opinion. Once you've been to XS, everything else is hard to top.

Nowadays there's also alternatives to the whopping $35 admission fee. If you do guestlist, admission is free ;). My husband and I ordered to-go food and when we picked it up, we had an issue with the gift cards we wanted to use. The manager, Melissa, was super helpful and polite and demonstrated superb customer service. We ordered a steak, lobster tail, and chicken bruchetta. My husband loved the steak; the lobster tail was a bit on the small side but cooked perfectly and tasted great. The chicken bruchetta was alright, and the moz. sticks were great. Thank you Melissa for your superior service!. Denise was so nice and she did a great job.  Do not let the other review scare you. She did a wonderful job. Went over the color choices and gave suggestions on what the appropriate color choice would be, then went over what shape I wanted. She listened to everything I said and followed what I wanted. She uses a numbing gel so you will not feel a thing. Very happy with everything and will recommend her to my friends.. i was considering giving this place 3 stars b/c of how ridiculously overpriced i thought it was, especially for chinese food, but then i thought again about how there are no other options in pittsburgh for good taiwanese food so why wouldn't these greedy/cheap asian owners milk their restaurant for all that it's worth?? that's just good business sense. so the food isn't bad, just overpriced but since i don't live here i am ok w/ it since i can go elsewhere for my chinese-food fix.. We got the catering goupon which they allowed us to use to dine in. My husband and kids thought the ribs were amazing. The sausage has a nice crunch to it's skin but there was no seasoning or sauce on them. The pulled pork was amazing!!!! The sides were terrific. We were seated quickly but after placing our initial order, which arrived quickly, it took a while for the wait staff to bring an extra fork and refill our drinks. The manager had to do that. It's a great little bbq place to go on a Sunday afternoon. Their dessert is a little high price though.. This place is so Good!! I always get chicken friend rice and wontonsoup!! Always so great , fast delivery!!. Helpful and friendly service ! Would come back again and recommend !. Joe's almost always has cover, no matter what time of night, but it's definitely worth it. The front area has pool tables, booths, tables, a large bar, and bathrooms. Ladies, be ready to wait in line (or sneak in the boy's room when no one is in there like I did)!  The back room has the dance floor, a stage with stripper poles (this can get slightly scandalous) and a bar. A very eclectic mix of people, I remember my friends nick naming it the UN convention, because all different types of people come together. Decent specials, but one of the more expensive bars on campus.. I have to admit, it's been a while since I've thoroughly enjoyed myself at a Vegas club/lounge. No wait to get in, free drinks, and good music. When I mean good, I mean good as in not 100% house. Props to DJ Morsecode for laying out the variety. It was enough to get me on one of the platforms and tear sh*t up. We probably could have left and hopped over to another place, but we were comfortable with staying here. Smaller venues like this seem to produce more memories for myself and the people I'm with. This is something to consider if you'd like a break from the larger, more crowded clubs.. Always friendly service and offers of water immediately upon store entry.  The store presents itself well, associates are knowledgable.  I shop here a lot & I always get great service.. The first time I came to 007 I walked in, sat right down and had an awesome spa pedicure at a really reasonable price! The gal who has done my spa pedicure twice now was very sweet and spent a lot of time on the foot/calf massage portion of the pedi. I was in heaven! 

My only gripe here has nothing to do with the staff, but the customers! Both times I've been in I've witnessed at least 3 other women treating the staff like dirt-- speaking to them rudely and criticizing them and their practices, speaking loudly on the phone during their service, etc. BE NICE. Just because English isn't someone's first language doesn't mean they don't understand. 

The staff is kind and accommodating and my toes look great. This is my monthly treat to myself!. We have been to BRGR about every two weeks for the last few months. Great for kids, great beer selection, and on par with Bubba Burger in Bridgeville but with a little better service and side choices.. Just a wonderfully family oriented staff that is so friendly and make the most amazing Greek food. I love coming here! The Greek salads are to die for! Even the small size comes with pita and a side of yogurt!. I love their rotisserie chicken. It's very flavorful. And the half chicken is a great way to share between 2 people for $11.50 (with 2 sides). Quarter chicken is $8.25, so unless you really need 2 sides each, you have just saved yourself $5. I always enjoy the fried yuca & sweet plantains, but lately I'm hooked on the cilantro rice. Most importantly I like the green and yellow sauces that come with each dish. Be warned: it's garlicky, don't plan on kissing anyone afterward without a serious mint or mouth wash.

Recently we walked in right after closing time (9pm) and the manager waved us in. I always like to give credit to places for not turning away diners (next time I'll know better). 

The patio is very quaint and a nice quiet spot to enjoy a conversation. 
And oh, they just started a new reward program, it's on an iPad in front of the register. Key in the phone # and it'll log in your spending.. Love Chipotle and thankful for the Thunderbird Chipotle being just 5 minutes from home!   Their crew is the best!. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Can't say enough about the Skinny Boost....jump started my New Year's resolution. Thank you!. The raw, organic milk you get here is as fresh as it gets. There're times when the milk I picked up was still warm. Other times, they're still labeling the bottles. Because the milk is unpasteurized, it needs to be refrigerated at 42 degree F, and lasts only 2 weeks. I don't have a problem w/ that as my boys chugs down a gallon of this stuff in 4 days! Thankfully I live close to SYD, so I'm always getting it fresh.. So fun! We were there late in the evenings, so it was pretty empty. The software is super easy to work and the problem was narrowing down the ones to print. They had great choices for displaying the prints, and it was hard to pick from those, too! The thing to remember is to pay for the prints and then wait to pick them up. Wandered upstairs to some really nice Polaroid displays and some fun with Andy. Having grown up with Polaroid, I miss the transience of the medium and the immediacy of the print, so this was a fun time, plus some affordable Christmas gifts!. Disclaimer: I was fairly intoxicated while dining here so my opinion may be skewered, however, I remember my food tasting amazing! Our waiter was funny and very patient with my group of friends. I'm sure he deals with our type of crowd often...it was 3am and we're in Vegas...he should get a medal! 

My friends ordered the grilled cheese...OMG, that was delicious. Had 4 different cheeses and the portions were huge. Good choice! My friend and I shared a bacon burger and turkey burger with cranberry mayonnaise...sounds weird but it worked great. I really loved the food. The kettle chips were perfectly crunchy and the fries tasted fresh. 

I would go back! :). Love this place! Great service and awesome food! I especially like their salads and lamb kebabs. Their hummus and bread are amazing as well!. Cute little breakfast place in a strip mall in Tempe (side note - why is everything down here in a strip mall?).  The atmosphere is open and airy, and the staff friendly.  We went for breakfast and while the sweets were tempting, I chose to go savory - I was very pleased with my build your own omelet, but I confess I was eyeing my friend's challah french toast as well.  He said it was good, and the eggs florentine also got a good review.

When I find myself back in Tempe, I'll be headed back here.. G&R Entertainment are as good as it gets. I used them for a corporate event and it was the perfect combination of professionalism and fun. I would highly recommend them.. Definitely the best buffet I've had in Vegas. The selection is truly diverse and high in quality. They've got everything from dim sum to enchiladas. A taco station and a crepe station. 

When the crowds have eaten a selection up, Bacchanal replaces it with another completely different food. 

Always fresh, always changing.. When I moved to Phoenix from NYC 6 years ago, I tried about 10 salons and couldn't find one with which I was happy, including some big, expensive salons. I found Daniel in 2007 when he was working at another salon, and I've been following him every since. I have never had a bad haircut, my color is always perfect, and he makes himself available to me whenever I need him. Plus, his prices are very competitive. I tried two other salons through the discount emails and each time Daniel had to fix my hair. I will never go to anyone else again! I recommended him to friends who tried him and they were very happy as well. I agree... he's a 5-star stylist!. **Disclaimer: I don't eat seafood so my review is based on the non-seafood items**

Prepare to spend a good chunk of your life waiting to be seated here. I didn't mind too much as I had friends waiting in line as I played Wheel of Fortune. This place really is a "bar" so there are only about 20-25 seats, thus the wait. 

Everything is made to order right in front of you. My personal favorite is the pan roast which is tomato and cream based. You choose the level of spiciness from 1-10. They throw in habanero peppers if you order a 9 or 10. I had a taste of my friend's New England clam chowder (chowder part only) and it was pretty tasty.

Aside from the occasional ridiculous wait time, this place is definitely worth trying at least once.. When my coworker first mentioned this place was opening I began to drool uncontrollably. When I pulled up the website and saw the pictures my eyes glazed over and the thoughts of consuming these amazing creations began to take up most of my days. Finally the day of my donut experience has arrived! I jumped out of bed this morning already knowing which donuts I'd be happily forking over whatever price they wanted in order to scarf down (ps- the price wasn't bad at all!) Arriving and ordering was all a blur as once the smell of hot donuts hits you, there is no room for other thoughts. But eating them? The lemonade donut changed my life, I'm pretty sure I can never settle for another donut shop again. And then the salted caramel, because I couldn't stop with just one. So warm, sweet, flavorful and delish!! Fractured prune- I love you.. Service was awesome... April was our waitress...extremely nice, attentive, and worked with a sense of urgency..the garlic fries are better than Gilroy garlic fries...and the lobster roll was awesome.... I stayed at the HO for the first time and I loved every minute of it! I felt like every time I entered the hotel I was taken back to another era....the 60s. For some reason the Brady Bunch came to mind; I think it was the 60's modern lines and the use of rock walls, similar to the outside of the Brady Bunch house. Anyone that knows me, knows that I am all about modern design, so its obvious that I would love this place. Who ever remodeled this place really nailed the retro-modern vibe. Bravo!

Next: My room was fabulous! I think my heart skipped a few beats when I opened the door to my room. It was so rad! and HUGE. The amount of counter space was amazing. The bed was massive and super comfy, and I loved that the bathtub was set kind of in the middle of the room. If you're the shy type, fear not! There is a super cool massive curtain that you can release so that it blocks the entire bathtub/bathroom area from the room. Toilet area had its own door, as well as the shower. There was even blue "mood" lighting as option over the bath tub area. Too cool! I was solo on this trip, so I didn't make use of the bath tub or the cool mood lighting, but I hope to get the chance to in the future! The room was equipped with all the standard amenities. I wasn't a fan of the product line offered though. The scent gave me a headache, so next time I'll make sure to bring my own soap. Did I mention the room had a huge balcony? Well it did, and it was without question the biggest balcony I've ever had in a hotel. 

(The only downside was that I was in building 5 or 6 and it felt a little disconnected. Plus, I did not know there was no elevator in that building, so carrying all my luggage on my own made it a little difficult, but it's not a deal breaker)

I loved the design, I loved my room, I loved that the fitness center was open 24 hours a day, and I loved the service.

Although I stayed for 3 nights, I didn't dine at Cafe ZuZu, so I'll try to check it out next time. I did enjoy their delicious Espresso though! And it looks like they throw some fun parties out at the pool, and I may have heard about a fabulous  rooftop with fabulous views...which I will be sure to checkout on my next visit.

I look forward to more stays at the Valley Ho!. After 3 visits, this has become my favorite Indian buffet!!! I never eat alone, but today I craved this place so much, I made an exception. 

The chicken tikka masala is perfect for those of us who love Indian but can't handle too much heat. The naan is delicious even if it is a little burnt.

Totally deserving of 5 HUGE stars!. Just finished an enchanted evening @ the Talking Stick Resort.  View from the 15th floor was magnetic.  Fire works display from one of the golf courses was an added bonus to a wonderful evening.  The food was superior.  Salmon Cakes, Risotto with (I swear it must have been Filet cubes the meat was so tender and melt in your mouth.)

The service was right on with a smile and at your every gesture should you need.  Live Music in the lounge was personable and well done.

Loved the brilliantly polished Terrazzo flooring with mother of pearl inlays.  I am an Interior Designer so I did appreciate the detailing, not too much yet well thought out and executed such as the interesting cultural display room. 

Main gaming area is of course filled with a wide variety of people.  Makes for good people watching.

Overall it was will worth the adventure and we will be back.  

I do have to comment on "David M's" negative review.  
Any wonder no "friends" after writing such a string of hate filled reviews from here to Cali?  Who would want this guy there anyway?  He hates everything & everybody. 

We get out of life only what we put into it.  If you go looking for a good time that is exactly what you will find at the Talking Stick.   We had a sincerely excellent time.. Wednesday is buy one get one free for sundaes, this month only. I was there every Wednesdays with my kids, time to give it a break.

Great employees!. The lunch buffet is a great value. For ~$13 a person, you'll get unlimited tacos, chimichangas, enchiladas, tostadas, salads, and soft drinks. The horchata is recommended and is included in the lunch buffet. Try it! It's sweet with a touch of cinnamon. I prefer it to horchata from some Mexican eateries in Los Angeles, even. When you're seated at a table, you're given tortilla chips and 3 different salsas. The salsas given with the chips are great. One is refried beans; another is avocado-based; the other is tomato-based. My favorite is the avocado-based salsa since it has great flavor and a little spice kick. The chicken tacos at the buffet were awesome. The lady assisting customers at the buffet was so friendly. There were only corn tortillas for tacos, but you can order flour tortillas at your table. I also really enjoyed the rice. It was flavorful without being too salty. The chicken chimichanga is nothing to rave about but still pretty good. For dessert, my party of 4 had split a banana foster. It was a bit too runny for my taste. I'm used to a more syrup-like consistency. Overall, I liked this place and would recommend to others. When I return, I'd like to try a margarita since they're known for having made the largest margarita in the world!. Viva La Trump!!

This hotel was perfect for our group of 3 and had plenty of room when the gang of + 6 came over to drink before going out. I loved how huge the bathroom was meaning 4 girls could get ready at one time without being in each other's way. I couldn't hear any hall noise thanks to the extra door on the outside of our suite and for the couple of hours I did get to sleep, the bed was really comfortable. I would do it again!. My accountant is right across the street from here and I arrived extremely early for our meeting and was starving so lucky me that this place was across the street. Its a big place! Very nice and simple with a cool bar to the right and food ordering to the left. Nice that you order, take a number and they bring your food to you. I was by myself and wanting to sit read and relax and they pretty much left me alone (in a good way!). 

I don't remember the name of what I ordered but very simple and good -1 pancake, 2 scrambled eggs and bacon. All was good and fast. I would definitely stop in again to check out breakfast again or lunch and I am not sure but they may have dinner too because I saw a back part of the restaurant but didn't wander.. Thank you Amelia and the whole Pretty Kitty family for not only keeping my kitty pretty, but my eyebrows as well.  I'm pretty sure they are the reason for eyebrows being on fleek.. Food = delicious! 
Service = not great
We got the Tom Kra Gai soup (coconut soup) and it was really good, not the best I've had but solid.
Also fried rice and the pumpkin basil dish (#80). 
Overall I will try another place in the area before coming back. Service is really important to me and it is just really lacking here.. Dominic and Jason at the bar were fantastic! Both very nice and fun to have dinner with. They suggested items on the menu that were great. We enjoyed the filet sandwich and ahi tuna. Thanks again, the food was great!. I started going to nail salons about 15 years ago... I can honestly say this is one of my favorite places. The first time I walked in I was a little scared to try a new place considering I've been going to the same nail place for 6 years but after getting a pedicure, a full set and brow wax I was very impressed with the work & how clean it was not to mention they were so friendly! I would recommend this place to everyone... No wait time, very clean, awesome service! What more can you ask for?! I didn't get the name of the women who did my full set but Rosa did an amazing job on my pedicure.. Right after I walked in and looked up...I was impressed.  

The decor is beautiful, classical and grand...  I especially love their rendition of the Sistine Chapel ceiling and the art filled shopping area.

The suites are also very nice and spacious with a seperate sunken living room area.

The Venetian definitely has alot of charm and I wouldn't mind staying here again.... We were so excited to try FnB. We had a fantastic business dinner here, and reserved this place based on recommendations from friends.  We weren't disappointed.

The appetizer salad we had was a combination of  watermelon, cucumbers, pine nuts, corn nuts, feta, cilantro, with a very light vinagrette. It sounded bizarre, but it totally worked.

The lamb manti, though, was transcending. All I can say is that it's over the moon fantastic. We all loved it. Imagine small little lamb packets topped with a light cream, and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds. Amazing. 

I had the pasta with heirloom tomatoes, and wow, the pasta was done right. The tomatoes were also divine, super sweet, and full of flavor. Amazing olive oil as well, I could have had a few more bites of just the oil and bread. Or twenty.

My husband had the hailbut, and it was perfection. Perfectly well cooked without being dry. The only thing I would have liked more was....more.

The wait staff was top notch, highly professional and very courteous. This is always a test for me. I loved each of their manners.

Can't wait to go back to this wonderful gastro pub!. Fran's has been on our restaurants-to-try list for awhile, and we're so glad we did!
Our group loved everything we had, starting with maple bacon wrapped tater tots.  The bacon was perfectly cooked and crispy, and the maple glaze added sweetness to balance the salty.  Yes they are sticky, but it's maple syrup!
Our entrees included chicken Parmesan, gooey meatballs for the kids, chicken sandwiches, and my Moroccan veggie burger. Our sides included the mac & cheese and Brussels sprouts--yum!
Desserts we tried were the chocolate cake and coconut cake.
Everyone LOVED the food, and our server was great.  We went at 6:30 on a Saturday night, and by the time we left the place was packed.  We won't hesitate to take more friends for the fabulous food!. I had the falafel pita for lunch. The food came out quickly. The owner was friendly and it was delicious.. A little pricy, but the food is very good, with large portions. Nice atmosphere.. Some of the best ice cream I've ever had. Super creamy and flavourful home-made taste without being icy or leaving a weird film in my mouth. The prices are a lot lower than I expected, too! 
After trying a sample of the "Vietnamese coffee" ice cream (which was delicious but not what I was craving), I got a scoop of double chocolate on a sugar cone with a few pieces of the home-made caramel they had sitting on the counter. 
They have a huge list of toppings, candies (normal and home-made treats), coffee and coffee drinks, and baked goods available too. Also, local art if you're into that.
I'll definitely be back for more.. Cool place to grab a drink if your staying at the Luxorl or waiting to get into LAX nightclub. Open & airy, dark romantic vibe going on, and they have video poker at the bar.
Tip- you get free drinks if you'r playing at the bar! hallah! 
Tip- try the Vodka tonic w/ lime. I had such a wonderful experience with Affinity Group Tours, I cannot recommend them enough! My friend and I worked with Connie to create a wonderful itinerary for our visit to England and we were so impressed with how smooth everything went! She recommended places that we hadn't even heard of and arranged all of our travel down to the smallest detail. We had an amazing time and can't wait to book with them again!. We have been here a few times  for breakfast and for lunch. Our longest wait was about 20 minutes on a Sunday when they were pretty busy. Our servers have all been nice and familiar with the menu.  Food  was excellent !  Alot of food, enough for leftovers. Fresh fruit and amazing granola on the pancakes.. I ate at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill - LV for dinner with my parents.  It's located in Caesars Palace, and it's a cool contemporary Tex-Mex place.  We enjoyed the assorted bread basket full of raisin bread, sourdough with cheddar & jalapeno and corn muffin.  I had the roasted corn soup and ancho chile-honey glazed salmon.  The food was delicious and unfortunately had no room for dessert, maybe next time?. Excellent Value, Very good food and seriously excellent service.  Last time we went there was no Veggie Korma on the buffet.  (Our favourite dish).  Our waiter immediately went to the kitchen and had the chef prepare a small bowl of veggie korma especially for us at no additional charge.  Now THAT is SERVICE!  We have always found the food hot and delicious.  At 11.99 for the dinner buffet, it is a real bargain.  In addition to a great many entrees including vegetarian options, there is a salad bar that includes fruit, and kheer (Indian rice pudding) other desserts and ice cream.  A take out container from the buffet is 6.99.   The afghan style bar-b-q chicken is particularly nice, and of course there is also the tandoori chicken as well as a mint chicken.  The curries range from mild to medium to hot, and there is a large selection of vegetable dishes.  The roasted veggies are delicious.  All in all - who can say more?  This is the best Indian food we've had in years and we try to return at least once a month.  We live more than an hour's drive away or we would be going much more often.. Wow, one of the few long-standing family owned & operated Arizona businesses.  The owners work in the business everyday and take pride in helping the families that they help.  They stand behind their product guarantee!  This is an Arizona Small Business that SUPPORTS the Arizona economy!  Very impressive!. Yet another friendly Lawrenceville establishment!  Being newbies, we were warmly welcomed by the owners and given a rundown of the ciders on the board.  We stood and sampled and eventually settled - well, I won the debate - on a growler of concord grape cider.  Yum.

I wish they had a nicer patio area in the back although I have to admit to a somewhat perverse enjoyment of walking out onto the street with my jug in hand, sitting and drinking on the sidewalk bench...channeling my inner Thunderbird wino.. Words cannot express how elated I am to have found Joanna, she worked nothing short of a miracle on my locks. After going to a different salon and having my hair absolutely slaughtered (both cut & color) I walked in believing there was no hope at having it fixed. My hair was butchered, yellow & impossible to brush. Joanna spent 3 hours transforming my hair back to fabulous. She brought my hair back to a healthy, beautiful blonde. Gave me a flattering new cut & even made it brushable! She was invested. I will never trust anyone else with my hair ever again. Joanna, if you see this THANK YOU. I am so grateful. You're amazing.. Nice and clean salon.  Great service, they happily accepted coupons and even gave us tips on how to save on our next visit.. Cute little family run sandwich shop! :) Wish there was a little more room to dine-in but great food and service. Can't wait to go back.. This is my usual spot to shop for groceries, last minute things, and especially holiday stuff. Well today, I went in, with full intent to utilize my WIC benefits. I had a couple of extra items, that I purchased separately, but what really stood out about today was my cashier. She was patient and sweet, and went above and beyond her job duties. We had a whole ordeal about the milk not going through the WIC benefits part properly, so I would end up having to pay out of pocket. She took initiative and went ahead and exchanged the milk I had brought up with me out for the proper one, and really did change my entire shopping experience. I mean, she could've just said, oh well, it doesn't scan, you'll just have to pay for it. She was sweet and caring and it meant a lot that she went above and beyond to do something like that.. WOW the food here is good!!!

I have to say I was honestly shocked by how good the food was at N9NE steakhouse. The Palms doesn't have much to offer these days but this steakhouse was great! 

The restaurant decor is so so. A little outdated and could use a face lift. 

Try their cucumber martini. It sounds weird but it was delicious! 

But the FOOD? Delicious. I had the prime rib and it was perfect. The lobster mac & cheese? To die for. Even the bread basket was perfect. 

Great food, great service. I will go back to N9NE again.. We stopped by Monday afternoon for an extended weekend brunch and were not disappointed. I've never seen so many benedict's! It also seemed to not be the busiest, which probably made our experience so-much-better. There's not a lot of waiting area that wouldn't put you hovering over another table.

I got the duck confit (coin coin benedict). The presentation was all you could ever want from your brunch. There were potatoes and a fruit skewer. My only complaint is that it was all a little under seasoned. Salting duck confit at the table might be viewed at as a cry for help.

The bathrooms are one of a kind for sure. Black lights, wall mirror, graffiti, wild life nature programs playing on a flatscreen tv in the bathroom make for a memorable experience for sure. Though you may want to consider who you bring here for this reason. It's also a bit loud for 11am. Grandma might not appreciate. 

The menu is French only, but most items are so simple and universal that if you're foodie enough to be eating in this place, it should be fine.

It does seem that it might be better to be a regular here... or if you're in a hurry, to get a cold sandwich. One or the other. The couple next to us got some sandwiches (equally as beautiful as our bennies) about 10 minutes before our order came.

All things considered, I'd definitely put this on my breakfast list for the next time I return to Montreal.. On a recent visit with friends, I had the Grilled Boneless Rainbow Trout with baby carrots and crushed roasted potatoes. SO GOOD, haven't had rainbow trout like this in years. The service was great and attentive. Drink was refilled before I had to ask. My friends had the Maui Tuna Crunch and the Oak-Grilled Filet Mignon, both of which were enjoyed. This would be a great place to take someone you want to impress.. Pros: Small airport that is easy to get to

Cons: I had to wait in the security line for over half an hour because they had only ONE SECURITY gate open. ONE. Good thing I got the later flight.

Decent selection of eateries once past security (Wendy's, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf).

Good selection of airlines - Southwest has a flight from LV to Burbank, CA.. The food and ambience was great as always. The service tonight was above and beyond thanks to our server Douglas!. The food is amazing. I had the salmon and potato salad.  This is no ordinary salad, the dish is served warm with fingerling potatoes, grilled vegetables and  salmon carefully laid on top with a  spicy mustard sauce. My description doesn't adequately represent the delicious meal. It was quite surprising for a brewery. The staff was great and knew the various beers to recommend to my novice palate. I am more fond of wine.  

Great experience.. This place is pretty cool.  Nice set up, people are nice.

Food is pretty good for bar food and the mixed drinks are strong. 

I like how the bar is split... the tv side is separated by a middle patio for the smokers and then the other side is the pool, darts and other bar games.

There's poker nights and other games too.

Some places give me the heebie jeebies, but I don't get that from this one.. Friendly and knowledgeable staff! 
I love the pick a brick to create competitions with the little ones to see who can make the best creation from their random bricks. 
It's also a lot of fun to create little mini Legos of each other.. Local recommendation, we loved the food and reasonable!  Plenty to eat.  Order at counter then take a seat.  Clean and very friendly.  Lamb was delicious and so was the ground beef kabob.  Will be back. The food here was pretty good. I got the spicy crab salad which was great, my mom got the lobster that was pretty good to,but not as good as the spicy crab salad.  For our main course I got the filet mignon with foie gras on top. The foie gras had an eggy taste at least it did to me,my mom thought it was good.. It won't change your life, but this is a nice place to get an efficient, inexpensive mani/pedi. I made an appointment which they were good about keeping, though the time of day I went I probably wouldn't have had any problem walking in. However, it's worth noting that earlier in the day when I went to make the appointment, they were swamped so plan accordingly!. Best pizza in town. Hardest working family I know. :). Just got my leather boots repaired here. There was a rip in the leather on the toe, and he said that although he couldn't completely fix it, he could make it look much better. He originally told me it would take about a week, but called me 2 days later to tell me they were done! He managed to match the color perfectly, and you can only tell they were fixed if you look very closely. It was also very affordable - I only spent $14 on the repair!. Absolutely delicious. Got the jackfruit quesadillas, the vegan Caesar salad, a cocktail, and the two special vegan cheesecakes. Everything was seasonal, fresh, and really innovative. The service is also really good. It's a great place to eat outside, also!. All I gotta say I have tried everything on the menu I come here at least twice a week and I love it delicious. I have recently fallen on hard times financially and couldn't afford to have my hair done in a pricey salon. It was hard for me to trust just anyone with my hair or just any place. A friend recommended Fantastic Sam's on Sahara and said see Michele. (She's the only Michele there). I was nervous at first but everyone there was so nice and polite that I felt at ease instantly.  I had my hair cut and highlighted by Michele and she was great!!! She has been cutting hair for 30 years and knew exactly what would work best for me. I received many compliments on my hair afterwards and was delighted. I highly recommend this salon and Michele!! In fact, all of the staff do amazing work. Fantastic Sam's accepts coupons and will even honor expired coupons.  I am a repeat customer.  Stop in and ask for Michele,  tell her Rebecca Ard sent you.. The only  reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because they don't use a razor blade and my trucker feet need to be razored.  For real.

Beyond that, this place was crazy awesome.  Saturday night 6 p.m., I realize that my pedicure did not survive my recent trip to Kentucky and my feet needed a little TLC.  I found this place on Yelp! thanks to the great reviews and the fact that it stays open until 7:30, later than most nail salons.

When I walked in at 6:50, I expected to be turned away, since they close at 7:30.  Nearly every pedicure chair was full.  Now I know why.  This place had several staffers and was pretty roomy compared to most nail salons.  It also appeared very clean.  For $18.99 you get a hot stone pedicure.   Which means in addition to a regular pedicure, the pedicurist massages your legs with a hot stone and then hot towels.  It's as awesome as it sounds.  So relaxing.

Someone also walked in at 7:15 for a pedicure, and they were taken care of.  I moved from the Eastside a few months ago and have driven across town every two weeks to see my regular pedicurist.  She does a great job but gas is getting ridiculous, so I may take turns using Luxury and my regular. 

I had some trouble finding the right parking lot to turn into, but I can get lost in a parking lot.  For the price and the great hot stone massage, I will definitely be returning.. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Always great service - quick service, and very friendly and attendant staff.

The only downside is that the wait can be a little long on busy nights and if you have a big group (understandable for any place) but they're very good about getting tables cleaned up to help the next party.

GREAT food. Pretty good sized menu of tapas, and nothing is ever bland. So much flavor to choose from! Whatever your taste it, I'm pretty sure you'd find something that you'd like.

The mojitos are freakin' BOMB. If you like bread pudding, theirs a must-try!

:). LOVE this place... found it on localdines.com for half off (still on there if you want it!). 
This is a lot like Postinos if anyone has been there: similar bruschetta thats amazing, salads, sandwiches, and sangria!
There Sangria is wonderful... a little sweet, but very tasty. Service is always awesome too!
My husband and I got our localdines gift certificate $15 for $30 worth of food and spent $33 after splitting an appetizer, entree, dessert and I had a glass of sangria and he had a glass of wine. GREAT prices! You simply can't get anything better for a dinner under $20, great service, and live music!. Taj Palace was great! For $11 you get a buffet with close to 10 types of curry and the usual salad, cauliflower and potato dishes and tandoori chicken. The tandoori chicken was a little too dry, but thats my only complaint. Taj Palace is one of the few places thats able to keep up with the ridiculous amount of naan I consume. Garlic naan does not cost extra!. Good Indian food. Have been going to this place for a long time. Sometimes they are out of South Indian dishes but if you ask them they might prepare it for you. I like their buffet as well. chicken tikka masala is to die for. I had been in a soup and salad state of mind for a few weeks and I finally came here to quench my thirst. 

We came when they opened around 11AM on Sunday and were surprised by how crowded they were. The sign said they opened at 9AM, so that might account for the line that formed outside the restaurant when they opened. They might want to update the signage for convenience. The salad bar was clean and had lots of options. The one thing I enjoy about Sweet Tomatoes and Soup Plantation is the consistency. They are all pretty much the same and you find the same favorites from restaurant to restaurant with the addition of the monthly specials they have. 

Service was friendly and most importantly, staff cleared plates and cups regularly to avoid pile accumulating on tables. They have a huge selection of drinks, which I find important since I like variety. Be sure to look out for coupons online or in the paper.. in my opinion, philip is extremely talented & dedicated. ive lived in vegas 4 yrs+ and he is my go-to guy for hair! he consistently provides me with quality service and hair-styling advice. highly recommend philip's salon charisma!. Food is absolutely amazing. Appetizers are family style and main courses (pastas and proteins) are small portions. My suggestions:

- lobster arancini
- clams casino
- orzo meatballs
- eggplant fries
- spaghetti with lemon and shrimp

Their spaghetti is their most famous dish for a reason. I originally thought it was just a marketing ploy but it's really delicious. Pasta is handmade and fresh. Shrimps are the size of mini lobsters but much more tender and less rubbery. 

To top it off, our server Greg was amazing and brilliant. He gave some great suggestions and provided excellent service. Also, his memory of the menu and our order was incredible.. The new item on the menu is BBQ.  Marty has nailed it. Smokey, meaty and great prices. Definitely worth a visit or two.. I'm pregnant and can't clean my own house with the correct chemicals! Marie came in with her crew and did an amazing job!!!!! I'm a neat freak and keep my house pretty clean but the work she did was over the top perfect! I can't wait for her to come next month:) this pregnant mama is super happy!. As a business traveler, I find the "cookie cutter" hotels can get old fast.  So, it was a delight to stay at Hotel Valley Ho!  The original mid-century architecture, combined with modern renovations and amenities, makes the Valley Ho unique.  The grounds are green and lush - an oasis in the desert.  Rooms are really large and very retro - even had martini glasses and a shaker!  I had breakfast outdoors twice, and the food was terrific. The pool areas are very relaxing with plenty of cozy outdoor furniture. The staff was welcoming and helpful. I'll go back for sure!. If you are looking for a high quality furniture, this is the place for you. They have a variety to choose from and if they don't have something they will find it for you. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a very helpful gentleman, who I found out was the owner of the store. I had something particular in mind, he brought tons of magazines and we searched for a long time until we found something that I needed. He didn't try to push what was already available at the store. Highly recommend them. All my friends are really happy with what they bought from these guys also.. In preparation for Afternoon Tea, my roommate and I spent the week talking with British accents (I always got in trouble for making mine to "poor" and Cockney) and drinking with our pinky fingers sticking out.   But even all that practice did not prepare us for how wonderful tea at the Phoenician would be!

As soon as we were seated we were offered a glass of champagne (which is unlimited, so drink up and get your money's worth!) to drink while we looked over the tea menu, there were about 15 or so to choose from.  Upon receiving our tea, my roommate and I simply poured our tea straight into our cups. You see, we're too low class to know how these fancy pants tea pots work, and we got cups full of tea leaves.  After noticing we had no idea what we were doing, a sever came over us and delicately said, "Ohhh, I see you two forgot to use your strainers." Yes. FORGOT. That's what happened! Thank you, kind server, for placing no blame on us...

Tea was followed by finger sandwiches (they made all vegetarian ones for us!) with the crusts cut off, followed by 2 scones with an assortment of toppings, followed by a pastry dish of 8 different bite-sized desserts! Yum!! 

Afternoon Tea is $55/person, with an additional 20% service charge.  Its slow paced and took us 2 hours to get through everything!  Its a good place for girlfriends to go together or to take a special lady to.. First things first: The diablo salsa is AWESOME!!  It doesn't come with the regular chips and salsa, you have to ask for it.  If you are a chili head, this is the only way to go!!

Their Happy Hour (4-7pm) is fantastic!  I'd be hard pressed to find another place where two people can eat and drink (even if our beer is NA) for $12.  The specials are only available at the bar but get there early so you get a seat.. What a fun few hours we had seeing the inside of the workings of the stadium. My son has a friend who works for the Sun Devils.  He showed us all around.
 the last time we were there visiting.   We saw where the players work out and the offices.  We saw lots of cool pictures of players, different helmets, and we even got to walk the tunnel where the players run to get onto the field.  You could almost hear the cheering once we got to the seats.  It was so much fun.  I knew my boys would love it but I did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did.  

We visitied the Sun Devil gift store.  Oh so many things to buy.  We did ok but could have bought more.  Both boys went to school there and are still huge fans.  It was a very fun experience.  Go Sun Devils !  Go gold and Maroon!. Moon is a pretty fun club to go to if you are trying to decide on where to go to dance on your trip to Vegas. Located inside the Palms, it is high on the top the hotel. It has a dance floor in the middle of the club and a roof that is retractable, opening up to the sky above. It also has an outdoor patio area that overlooks all of Las Vegas. The music is good and the people all seem to be there to have fun.. Loved the food...loved the service, but the view of the Bellagio is the best!!. The service is not as fast as the eastside (Pho Saigon 8), but it is more flavored the Pho soup here in Spring Mtn..
The prices are very affordable... I have had every birthday since I was eighteen at Rum Jungle in the Mandalay Bay. I cannot get enough of the food, the atmosphere, the drink menu (&#61514;) and the fact that after dinner, if you stay long enough, you are smack dab in the middle of the nightclub. If you are visiting Vegas or a local, you can enjoy the beauty of the restaurant and its uniqueness that's hard to find anywhere on the strip. The main centerpiece of the restaurant is a towering glass bar that illuminates from within. It dimly lights the entire bar in soft shades, and sets a romantic mood for couples, or a party mood for friends. I prefer the latter, but that's besides the point. For dinner, you cannot order anything other than the Firepit. I won't allow it. It is more of an event than a meal, actually. The waiters bring a medley of meats and sides and carves portions right there at your table. The process takes a bit, but it's worth it because you fill up over a period of time instead of just chowing down. Stick around for the nightlife too. Dancers perform on the top of the glass bar, walls of water curtain the tables from each other, and music is loud and dance-inducing. Let me know if you go, I may invite myself to tag along!

Recommended entre: The Firepit!!! TheFirepit!!!

Recommended drink: Vodka tonic with some mint leaves.. my favorite downtown coffee place.  The servers are fantastic and there is a big big big selection of teas some that i dont get at other places.  The food is super tasty and fresh and has a lot of good people watching seats. hooray for local owned shops!. I don't have a lot to say beyond what has already been said, so I'll briefly share a few things my dinner companion and I made note of:

The Good
- Great looking spot in the esplanade, right off the ground-level parking behind the escalators
- Comfortable seating (we sat at a two-top)
- Nice, dim lighting
- Excellent food.  His chicken street and my barbacoa short rib tacos were outstanding
- Free homemade chips and salsa
- Nice happy hour pricing

The Bad
- The red sangria was horrid. There wasn't any fruit in my friend's glass.  The wine tasted cheap and not at all fruity like a sangria should.
- The music belonged in a nightclub, not a casual establishment in CenPho.  Like my friend said, they need to create an identity for this place and play music that suits it, not just blast some loud house crap.
- The music was WAY TOO LOUD.

We used a $10 Groupon and split the remaining $29 bill.  Great value for two dinner platters and two drinks.  Our waiter, whose name I didn't catch, was friendly, attentive, and made sure our water glasses were always full and checked in on us often, but not too often.

I look forward to returning!. I had the maxwell with grilled onions and it was outstanding. And the onion rings are the best. Love this place. I'm so glad you came to scottsdale. What took so long?. This a definitely hole in the wall! The food is awesome! Our server suggested that we try the fresh spring roll with bbq and that's a bomb. I never liked fresh spring rolls but this is an exception. Their pho is definitely the best in the valley. It's so flavorful! I didn't finish my pho so I took it home. It's still good the next day. I checked in and I had free drink! Too bad that they don't have fresh coconut when I went there so I tried the vietnamese coffee. It's on the strong side.

I love their macaron ice cream sandwiches! The flavors that I wanna try is not available so I settled on red velvet macaron with caramel ice cream! My husband tried the red velvet macaron with rocky road ice cream. Can't wait to go back and try more macarons!!!. Mon & Tues special to go is the perfect way to surprise your loved one with a delicious meal without breaking the bank or a sweat. One meal easily feeds two people. If you're not a large eater,  u could find yourself in a comparable situation. I ordered two Mon night specials w bread for an impromptu dinner w 2 other women. This being their first time having Babbos, I hit the ball out of the park! After gushing & complimenting my ability to always know the best spots...haha..we were stuffed & had never opened the 2nd container. Between the three of us we were more than satisfied from one meal. But no one complained about having the extra one bcuz it was such a hit we would've hated to not have leftovers! Kudos to you Babbos for not only having one of the hardest menus to choose from while dining in (everything screams choose me!). But you are the only restaurant I know that gives equal food, taste, service, portion size, and value on your carry out items. I stear clear of take out for this exact reason yet u've shown there are still places that deserve the benefi of doubt..Thank you for knowing if a night at Babbos doesn't fit our schedule, our family is blessed to still enjoy the same delicious meal at our dining table as they would if they were there. You Rock!. Heaven on earth! Get the Buen Dia and mocajete yum! They have homemade tortillas which taste amazing. This is my new favorite spot in Vegas ESPECIALLY f you're hungover!. Free birthday meal!? HECK YES!

Sooo on your bday they email you a 7 coupon for your bday, as long as you sign up for the email club prior. Now Ive been to Rubios in San Jose and really liked it! My son enjoys their classic fish tacos, and on Tuesday after 230 you can get them for 1.25 each! DEAL!! I on the other hand do not like fish, but do like shrimp, Im a weirdo lol. Anywho we ventured here after school a few days before my bday (they send the email on the first of the month) 

I scanned the menu for chicken and shrimp options, and asked the cashier what she recommends, her answer were the street tacos. Now I wanted to get more bang for my freebucks so I ordered the chicken burrito sans tomatoes. My son chose 2 fish tacos so my total was only 3!! SCORE!! We went to the salsa bar and got some hot salsa and FRESH cut limes!! FRESHHHHH! We always opt for water bc soda is the devil, I went ahead and squirted (dirty!) a lime into my water and enjoyed how yummy it was! 

We only had a short wait and our food was BROUGHT OUT to us! WHOA! I couldve walked my little fat ace up there and when I seen him I stood up and he said no and walked it to us. Talk about hospitality! I cased my burrito and noticed it needed to be mixed up and needed more crema. I was a little afraid to ask, but he gave me a generous helping of it. YUM! So I put my crema and salsa and salted that bad boy. Now typically I do not like beans in burritos, unless theyre from Chipotle. Here the burritos taste like a more Mexican chipotle and most def make you feel fuller. The burritos are long and medium, not short and fat like Chipotle. 

We both bit into our yummies and honestly I wasnt crazy about the burrito... it was kinda a fail : ( It honestly had no seasoning and was pretty bland even after all the stuff I added. I even added lime to give it a light taste, but negative! Also the tortilla dried out pretty fast bc the AC was on in there so my burrito pretty much stooped over and died mid meal. Thank goodness they give you chips otherwise Id be eating it with a fork. My son only ate 1 taco bc they also got a little soggy... we are the weirdos who take like an hour to eat, but since the ac was kickin it kinda died up our tortillas. No biggie! Cant be all grim over almost free food!!

Now I give this place 4 stars bc of the customer service, as mentioned above both the cashier and food runner were very courteous. Also, my son was wandering and seen a beach ball so I asked if they sold them and the cashier gave him a FREE RUBIOS BEACHBALL! How nice right?!

All in all we'll go back to try the other yummies!!. Totally fun time.... Great location in The Linq even though I hate The Linq hotel .... Good look staff... Very attentive and makes nice shots!. My favorite place to get a cold one and wings with friends when paying Ahwatukee a visit. $2.50 Blue Moon Saturdays, anyone? They always have fantastic drink specials basically every night of the week. 

The live music line up is just . . . meeehhhhhhhhh. But it sure is amusing to watch the Stepford Wives of the 'Tuke try sooooo hard get their dance on in their 16-year-old's clothing when you're hammered. :)

UPDATE 12/11/2012:  Blue Moon is now $2.75 . . . still a great deal!. My husband  and I were sick and was able to obtain some of your chicken noodle soup and I must say it was best tasting soup I have ever had! It certainly hit the spot!. Trying to find a good place a place to get your car washed on a post rainy day is hard. Which lead me to squeaky clean, I thought the guys were nice and I liked that they do oil changes too if you need it. The building was clean and had good chairs to sit in while you wait. I also enjoy the free coffee and popcorn too. They have good prices for what they offer, hopefully I will love the job they do too.. Really great little bar with amazing food.  Nice outdoor patio and lots of tv's for sporting event viewing.  You can also reserve the patio for private parties.. We went to Hexx today for lunch, and I actually said the words, "Holy Moley!" when I took my first bite of the CRUSHED YUKON GOLD POTATOES (pecorino, crispy garlic, arugula) Absolutely deilicious. Also tried the CRISPY BROCCOLINI (dried chili, citrus, golden balsamic)...super yummy...and then a variation of their Chinese Chicken salad - instead of the chicken it was made with Kobe beef...Yes...I ate the whole thing. The atmosphere was wonderful-it was a lovely day, so all of the glass doors were open and a nice breeze coming through. The service was also excellent. We then tried the chocolate tasting in the retail shop-yum! Had to take some of that chocolate home with me. It's made right there straight from the bean!. Wow.. best hotel I have ever stayed in.

We stayed here this past weekend for my boyfriend's birthday. From start to finish, the Aria staff made us feel welcomed and were polite and helpful. They sent us complimentary chocolates for it being his birthday.

The room was amazing... nice corner strip view, big comfy bed, big shower with bathtub, the remote control operated curtains and lights was a cool touch. 

The tram from the Aria to Bellagio was also a nice discovery.. it definitely cut down some walking time. 

The Five50 Pizza bar restaurant is the best pizza I have ever had! Delicious!

Great atmosphere and great people. I can't imagine staying anywhere else now that I've been spoiled at the Aria.. Generally I am a fan if I stick to what I know I like

The beer battered shrimp cabo-tacos. When I get this I am a happy camper...but I have tried other things that fall short.

Chips and corn salsa can go either way- sometimes they are fresh and delicious - sometimes they are stale and not so delicious. 

I had the lemon tuna tacos yesterday and they were just-ok. I like my tuna on the rarer side so this didn't really do it for me. The cabo fish tacos are just ok in my opinion -although I am not a huge fried fish eater. I am not so into the steak tacos either. 

The jalapeno mashers  are really tasty although they certainly are not the most health conscious choice 

Margaritas are pretty standard here. I've had good luck in terms of service and the place itself is really cool.

Solid 3.5-4 ( 4 if I get my go-to meal). This place has been on my ever expanding list and I'm pleased to say I've now ticked this baby off.

It's lunch time on a dreary afternoon in Edinburgh and I'm in need of something to eat.

I'm quite happy with the chicken pesto panini. It's tasty, toasted and filling. They stock my fav ginger beer - bunderburg, so all happy here. On a plus they even serve up dear green coffee - fab flat white too! Shame no room for cake as they all looked pretty tasty!. Omg yum. Love my Mother's Day Pie. Thank you thank you! You only loose one star b/c I overheard the pie chick say over the phone "what pie order?" Plus I hate how the interior of your store is set up since everyone is bunched at the door since the register is at the door! Not a good set up for busy times.. Before Yelp came to Canada I found myself wandering St Denis not knowing where to eat. That was 4 summers ago. When I searched "Mussels" on Yelp recently, I came face to face with the very place I passed an evening drinking fruity beers from a staggering list and nibbling on frites. And how happy was I to find an old favourite.

This time, I was floored by the choices in mussels - three pages worth! Between the Guinness or wine broth blended with a symphony of onions, tomatoes and other tasty ingredients there's no way of getting bored of the choices, unless of course you're not into mussels. 

And if that's the case... the medley of sausage might be just up your alley! Ostrich, duck and beef, served with fries. If I could chose again, I'd ask for three of the duck sausage with it's citrus goodness. And in the department of fry dips, I'd go Dijonnaise over and over and over again. (You get one dip with every order of fries, but you'll have to specifically request ketchup)

Grab a beer, or a bite, or both. There's plenty of seats, lots of TVs, lively posters and an overall atmosphere that will make you feel like a local.. I wanted to try a Chicago style pizza for the longest. So we decided to to order one for pick up since we live so close. We called and the person I spoke with was kind and professional and said the pizza would be ready in 30 mins. We got a large with sausage and pepperoni and a order of Cajun fries.  It cost about $30 for all ( which was steep I thought to myself). As we picked up the pizza it was so heavy and hot fresh from the oven and the fries were packaged nicely. We got home and opened the box, this pizza was massive. I couldn't believe my eyes I thought to myself okay the price is worth it. Now the taste, the crust was crispy in the outside and soft I the middle, and they did not skimp on the cheese and toppings. It was delicious, and we will definitely order again!. Yes, it was a little disappointing that the Battle scene wasn't live.  I understand the circumstances and that you can't just simply change the ending, but I was waiting for a big finish!  But, the show really impressed me.  The story was followable and the acts were great.  This was my first Cirque experience and I wasn't too sure what to expect - the stage and theater were really impressive to me! I don't think you'll find a stage like this anywhere else.  I walked out of the show wishing it was longer and wanting to go see some of the other ones!

Just an FYI: I booked my tickets through a Living Social promo that redirected me to the MGM ticket site.  The tickets were only like $65 a piece. The map on the website showed that our seats were in the first row of the 200s sections, near the middle of the theater.  However, when we picked them up, our tickets were completely backwards and instead of being in the middle, we were on the very end which made it difficult to see.  So, next time, I would call to make sure the seats were actually as advertised.. Loving a Crisp location in Dilworth!  I've already been twice, and loved each visit- great fresh ingredients for my 'build my own' salad, and the Chicken Bruschetta wrap was DELISH!  Its a great option for a quick and healthy lunch/dinner option, and the portions are large- one salad feeds me a dinner and lunch the next day!
Friendly service, clean and a great location.  I will be back for sure. I hate to say it (beacuse Steve Wynn is a royal jerk) but the Wynn is one of if not the most stunning and classy-looking hotels oh the Strip. No fake
skies frippery or a cast of characters wandering about (and I realize Wynn owns hotels that fit that description as well), just clean lines, artful
design without being overly ostentatious (at least by Vegas standards!). Also, it has arguably the best buffet brunch in Vegas.. My husband and I saw a video on my Twitter page and took our grandsons the next day for breakfast.  The boys loved the smore pancakes and the nutella and banana crepes.  My husband had a great veggie omelet and tried the banana pancakes on the side.  I had the goat cheese and fig jam omelet.

Every bite was delish and we were able to share w/ the huge portions.  The coffee was fantastic as well.  Our server was new but really wonderful.  We hope to make reservations and take the entire family for a holiday breakfast very soon!. Great menu, featuring healthy and unique twists on favorite items. Our party enjoyed Beer Macaroni and Cheese and Vegetable Tostadas with Yam chips (a twist on sweet potato crisps, it seemed). The beer selection was excellent (including three in-house IPAs). It seems that a lot of items are made fresh day of, as they were out of a few items by the time we got there late on a Friday. I take this solely as a compliment to their freshness, though.. I would fly back to Las Vegas just for the octopus salad - how did they make octopus more tender than a perfect scallop?. Went for lunch, patio was full so we waited at the bar for 10 minutes.  Once sat, I contemplated over the menu as there were many items I wanted to try.  I've been before, but it was so long ago when the place first opened so I feel like it was trying the place for the first time.  I ordered the braised pork tacos and they were very filling.  I was going to take a to-go box but there were like 10 birds in the trees above I was paranoid one slipped some shit into my plate while I looked away.  All that being said, lovely patio, busy with local diners, and the food is good with healthy options.. A friend and I were up  in Phoenix for the day and chose this place for lunch  d/t other Yelp reviews. Must say the Stetson chopped salad was out of this world. A crazy combination of ingredients that work so well together. The high point was the server giving us a copy of the recipe for it! Yeah!  BTW, never knew Mexican Fresca was so different than domestic.. HUGEEEEEE pastrami sandwich. Honestly, America, this is why your fat. I shared this is a guy and we still had leftover. I had to take out about half the meat in my half and take it to-go. They're super nice though, gave me extra bread so I could make a whole new sandwich with my leftovers.

It was pretty good, not something I would be dying to eat when in Vegas but definitely glad I got to take a picture with it,..haha. This place is so new that when my friend suggested we go there for lunch, I had never even heard of it.  Fortunately, always up for something new, I agreed to go and I think I found a new favorite lunch spot downtown!  Bluebird Kitchen is located just around the corner of market square, next to Chipotle, and really sticks out as an original, non-chain, clean and cute bakery/eatery.  The inside is a gorgeous open space and very clean.  Their lunch menu is made up of an extensive selection of sandwiches, soups, salads and various sides.  (I didn't see the breakfast menu, but was informed they will start serving it tomorrow.)  In addition to lunch and breakfast, they had an array of delicious looking desserts.  The best part about Bluebird Kitchen is that everything is homemade daily, which is so refreshing.  

For my lunch I got the Cuban sandwich and a cup of gazpacho.  My sandwich, served warm, was to die for!!  I could eat this sandwich for every meal and be a happy girl, except now I'm too intrigued and want to try everything else.  I did try to order the chicken salad sandwich at first, but they were all out of chicken salad.  (I went for a late lunch and they said this was a best seller - obviously I will be back to try it asap.)  My gazpacho was refreshing - I prefer a little more spice in mine, but I'm sure it's a bit different every day since it's made fresh.  

As my friend and I were waiting for out food to be made, the owner, Liz (I think,) came to chat with us and was super friendly and genuinely interested in what we ordered.  She even offered me a free dessert while we waited!  (She clearly knew the way to my heart.)  I thought she just meant a free sample, but she gave me a whole gigantic cookie sandwich!  I'd be lying if I said this didn't make my day, maybe even week. :)  I got the chocolate cookie sandwich with pistachio filling.  Honestly, every dessert looked marvelous but I have a soft spot for pistachio desserts.  Like everything else, this cookie sandwich was excellent and I wish I could eat a dozen of them at once.

My only suggestion would be that they put some chairs or seating in the space.  There are bar tops along two walls that some people were eating at standing up, but the space is definitely big enough to put in some small tables/chairs or at least stools at the bar tops.  My friend and I had planned to eat outside so this didn't affect us - it would just be a nice option.  

I will be recommending this place to everyone I know - I even grabbed some menus to put in my office.  I really hope the best for this place and think we need more unique eateries like this downtown.  I can't wait to go back and slowly, but surely, try the rest of the menu!. The St. Louis ribs were very tasty, the chicken juicy and flavorful. Loved the peanut slaw , mac and cheese and collard greens were great! Truly enjoyable meal. We will be back! Oh! also the apple cinnamon butter is fantastic!. Love the decor, rooms are clean and beautiful. The atmosphere is upscale and fun. No smokey casino. 

Getting in and out is easy. I prefer the tower closer to the strip. 

Eat at Henry's for breakfast. The breakfast burrito is to die for. 

Make sure to try the secret pizza place while you're there. 

Early gambling minimums are reasonable and the craps tables get hot.. Love the portobello mushroom sandwich! They have free delivery and very friendly employees. They also have very fast service... Every time I have ordered, they have been early than expected bringing the food which is also a plus!. Very easy to make an appointment, almost no wait and the staff and Dr. Radtke were knowledgeable and very friendly.. I recently stayed at the pointe and went to Rico's for a birthday dinner. We had David as a server he was fantastic. Personable, attentive, prompt, overall we had a wonderful time. I would highly recommend the Pasta Del Mar it was delicious and the kiddos liked that a cookie came with the kids meal. 

We were not impressed with the hostess she wasn't very friendly but everyone else throughout the evening was excellent.. Great place! Awesome sushi and Japanese grill. Great food and service!

If you have a larger party, though, call ahead. And parking at the Waterfront is a nightmare sometimes, so I'd advise going early, parking and then enjoy the shopping, restaurants and bars in the area.. Heard it was their grand opening today so we had to go check it out. Their food was delicious! My sister in law and I shared a Pho dac biet (beef noodle soup) and Bun cha gio thit nuong (vermicelli noodle topped with  egg roll and pork). Both were on point! Loved the taste and the portion size. We couldn't finish either dish and we had to assure the waiter that the food was good, we just couldn't finish! The Vietnamese ice coffee was yummy too. I did order a che ba mau (three colored dessert) but they aren't fully stocked just yet and it wasn't available. The menu is pretty extensive and we didn't get to try a lot obviously.. But I'm excited to go back!

The decor is cool too. Very clean and modern. Felt like a contemporary clean restaurant with very authentic flavors. Glad I found this place!. I found out about Donut Co. through an ad/menu and decided to make a midnight run. I noted it was within relatively easy biking distance of the ASU campus, which was exciting since I've been looking for a donut shop that can fit that distinction. I asked my friends to choose which donuts they wanted off of the menu I found and despite the late hour at which I went there was an ample amount of each kind to pick from.

The donuts themselves were soft and tasted fresh, particularly the donut holes. I didn't heat them up when I got back since my friends didn't have a microwave in their dorm room, but I'm sure they would have tasted even better warm. And better than their donuts was their boba tea, the special signifier for my 5 star rating.

I went for a taro flavored boba smoothie, which I've had before at other boba tea establishments. While I usually enjoy taro smoothies, the way they prepared theirs made it possibly one of the most delicious things I've ever had the pleasure to drink. The taste was akin to the scent of a pumpkin spice candle, but in creamy purple smoothie form. They didn't skimp on the tapioca either. Absolutely perfect drink, even on my chilly bike ride back to my dorm. Cannot recommend this place enough for fans of boba tea.

The cashier was friendly and attentive, particularly for a late-night employee. Absolutely wonderful shop.. Previous review was filtered, but I encourage people to read it (scroll to bottom of page). For some reason, recent positive reviews all appear filtered.

I absolutely love Ruffin' It Resort, and my lab loves it more. The quality of care she gets at her bi-weekly daycare visits is always outstanding. She plays hard, so a few bumps and scrapes here and there, but never anything serious. The dogs always look happy and the staff has been wonderful. Anyone in the area in need of daycare visits should definitely take the tour.. This place is out of this world. The food was adorned in the most beautiful dishes. We highly recommend  this "Place" to anyone wanting a good time and great food.. $12.99 for a full rack of baby back ribs!
Make sure you get the players card and print out a discount coupon first
Paired with the $2 hefeweizen. Delicious!!!. I great place to go to watch sports games. It was packed, so my friend and I decided (instead of waiting for a table) to go to the bar. We Were instantly seated right in front of the flat screens and had a perfect view of the game! 
The only complaint I have, was that the server messed up our order and what sauces we wanted on our wings. We decided not to say anything cause we were starving and it took long enough to get our wings the first time. 
The thai style and original sauces are my favorite! Must try. 
And as always, boneless or it isnt happening.. Great place ! Brought my kids for cuts . Loved the service, very nice friendly people. Highly recommend. 
Complimentary drinks, Great service , awesome prices  what more can you ask for.. Love the vibes here! Definitely a great environment to just grab a few drinks with people and chill. I haven't had their food, but they definitely mix good cocktails. The bartenders offer great service! They are attentive, quick, and entertaining. The two guys who were bar tending when we were there had us laughing all night and took good care of us. We will definitely be going back. The only thing that was slightly off putting... And this is minor... Was that at the bar there are machines and the management has the bartenders put signs on the seats that say "these seats are reserved for players only." I can understand they want to make more money, but there are no bar seats without player machines. From experience I've gotten better service at the bar than when at a table with a server, so I prefer sitting at the bar. So that caught me off guard. Otherwise, though, everything was awesome!. BFG definitely knows their chicken!!!!

After months of eying this place, we finally made it for a spur of the moment lunch. We wanted to actually stop by on Sunday, but thanks to Yelp, it told us that they were closed. I made my fiancé meet me up at BFG's for lunch today. It was definitely worth the drive and being late for work.  I walked in and #1 combo caught my eye....the mac and cheese sold me. The fiancé ordered the #2 combo. 

Service was pretty awesome. One of the owners noticed that we were newbies to BFG's and took the time to explain to us what the different selections of chicken were. He also came back repeatedly to check on how we were doing. For a "fast" food joint, that's some pretty dang good service. 

For the food, I definitely did not go wrong with the #1. The baked chicken was so tender and juicy, it makes my mouth water thinking about it. It was seasoned with a rotisserie spice and baked. Also, the fact that it's juicy white meat wins them the 5 stars. I am not a dark meat fan and for those dark meat lovers, this white chicken will have you fooled. I liked that you could choose the different sauces although I ate most of my chicken without sauce. Mac and cheese was definitely cheesy. I'm a cheese whore, so this definitely met my standards. I was able to try the fried chicken and it was tender and juicy inside. I do think I prefer the baked chicken over the fried chicken though BUT that's just MY opinion. 

Overall, the chicken is very delicious and anyone who hasn't tried this place is missing out. We definitely will be back for more baked and fried goodness. OH and it helps that they have a stamp card.....benefits of going repeatedly...I'll take a free meal anytime.. Took my doxie here on Tuesday and fell in love with the whole staff there that night.  I called at 615 asking about my dogs funny behavior. I decided against taking him in that moment and changed my mind 10 min later. I called and they stayed open so that I was able to make it there even though they close at 630. I agree they are pricey but totally worth the friendliness of the staff to myself and the care and attentiveness toward my dog. Will be going there for any other problems from here on out!. This place was completely unexpected. Found it on Priceline for an excellent price, was skeptical at first, but was completely pleasantly surprised! The room was extremely comfortable and convenient and the guest service was very accommodating. Try the Cafe Tranquilo, its breakfast was delicious! I'll be sure to come back here next time I'm in Phoenix! Justin was also super friendly and nice to us at the front desk! Thanks everyone. We came here on Sunday night for the Rib Eye special and were pleasantly suprised. The steak was cooked perfectly and all the food was seasoned well. Our drinks were also tasty and reasonably priced. 

Also, love the decor, it is a nice spacious restaurant and it is very nicely decorated. If we ever find ourselves in Vegas again, we will definitely check this place out again!. 2 visits in a week, it's that tasty! My 86 year old father loves this place- huge portions, fairly priced.. Staff is super friendly and the tablet you fill in your info on in the foyer instead of a stack of papers to fill out by hand. The doctor had a corny sense of humor (like my dad) and he was inviting, knowledgable, and very sure of himself.. I ABSOLUTELY recommend them. I have worked with this company for years for my event, Relay for Life at ASU. They have been the best vendor I have worked with in all my years of event planning. Bob and his brother are literally the nicest guys to work with, have never ONCE price gouged me and I constantly recommend them.. Their rolls are super inventive....and they stay open later than most Sushi Places in the Valley (2am).  

Their Happy Hour is insane! Ex: 99 cent beers on Tuesday!

I've never had a disappointing meal here, and I am pretty hard to please when it comes to sushi.

They have a little karaoke room, and full bar you can make use of as well.

1 Thing: When it's busy, be prepared to order everything at once...or you will be waiting.. A perfect meal in Vegas! Although the wait was over an hour long, we immediately found a table in the bar which turned out to be more intimate than any of the tables in the dining room. Service was prompt; the waitress delightful and extremely knowledgeable. This was literally the best meal I have ever shared with my boyfriend of nearly a year. Each item was split and served on two plates in perfect presentation: the heirloom tomato salad, the blackened halibut. The brussel sprouts and lobster mash potatoes were of plenty proportions - and the mash had the most perfect creamy flavor with an abundance of lobster. The variety of breads were served warm with soften tabs of butter. Ever staff person was attentive. The drinks, a pomegranate martini and cucumber cooler, were a homerun. I've never tasted something better in my life. If I had the room, I know the butter cake would kick butt of any cake I ever ate (I'm going back today to make sure). And the coffee served at the end of the meal was the testament that the entire meal was EPIC. Thank you Mastro!. Excellent flavor selection (including some unqiue finds like Oatmeal Cookie, cupcake batter, and strawberry lemonade.  Also a wide selection of quality toppings (fruit appeared fresh, not frozen).  The place was immaculate, and the primary yogurt attendant was polite and helpful (offering free samples, as well as descriptions of the flavors).  My only complaint about the place was that a bevy of on- and off-duty employees (teen girls) were creating quite a bit of noise near the customer seating area, and their somewhat mean-spirited conversation was a real bummer.  Mean girls live..... It must be coincidence that my ROTD pick is the place where I reconnected with Eric R. last year and is where he proposed to me last night!

After a marvelous dinner at Shabu Shabu Paradise sitting next to Katrina M., we made our way to the M to "walk off dinner" and go to the wine bar.  We had 2 wine tastings, then I asked Eric if he was ready to go...he said no, he wanted more hahaha!  Well I went to the restroom and when I came back and sat down, he says he got me a gift in Texas, gets down on one knee, and asks me to marry him!

Jay, the awesome Hostile Grape staff, took some pictures and brought us champagne!  I was in shock so I can't remember all of the details :)  There was a guy and 2 ladies next to us who also sent some wine over for us to celebrate.  We took turns going upstairs to call our parents and left tipsy and stuck together like stamps to a letter!

Thanks Hostile Grape and Jay for the special experience, the champagne, and the memories!!!! :-P. This used to be the The Fish Market. It looks similar to the old restaurant but with a fresher look. I'm glad they kept the Fish Market employees because our waitress was very friendly and attentive. We came for the Happy Hour /Small Plate Menu. I love the small plate concept because I like to try a little bit of everything. The shrimp ceviche lettuce wraps were zesty, fresh and had big chunks of avocados. My favorite was the salt and pepper shrimp. They were so crunchy and delicious that I didn't even care they had eyes. My fiance really liked the burger slider with Gruyere cheese and french fries. It was a great value we each had a cocktail and split 4 small plates for $30! We will be back to try the calamari slider. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is, I frequently like to preview the online menu before going to a restaurant and some of the advertised prices and entrees were different on the online menu then at the restaurant.. We decided to head to Fili B's because tonight we wanted good, inexpensive, and fast food. 

Berto's restaurants are quintessential to Phoenix, and have proven themselves time and time again. 

But to night there was no way I wanted to deal with an idiot waiter, crying kids or being too early for happy hour. ... Oh wait is Saturday, there are almost no happy hours. 

"Three carne asada burros please," I ordered happily while I handed over my 10% off coupon I had received from the Fry's market earlier that week.  While we waited for our food, we helped ourselves to the clean "fresh salsa bar".  There was, and always is, an assortment of salsas, pickled carrots, pickled onions, pickled jalapenos, fresh onion, fresh cilantro, lemons and yes of course plenty of warm chips all waiting for you to help yourself to. 

Tonight whoever was building the burritos had a heavy hand with everything, these were huge burritos... and to think we were going to split the third burrito. 

With our bellies full and wallets fat we left with a smile, thanks FiliB's for coming thru again.. The Michigan pizza is our favorite! They only use the best ingredients and boy does it show! After you have pizza here you'll be so spoiled that no other place will compare. Maddy provides the best service, her knowledge of the menu and beer selection is spot on and makes everything that much better.. I stopped at this salon while my son was at preschool. It had just opened so I was able to have 2 manicurists working at the same time and complete a gel mani/pedi in about an hour! The staff were all very pleasant and easy to talk to, but didn't bother me with a bunch of questions about my life. I was able to completely relax and not worry about anything for that hour. The facility was super clean with newer chairs that are comfy and provide an enjoyable massage. The 2 manicurists did a fantastic job and I will definitely repeat my business.. It's Denny's people, idk why the low marks. For a cheap quick meal it served its purpose. Wanted a budget breakfast en route to Wet Republic and we found it. Had breakfast and the food was hot, quick and tasty. Everything was clean, nice employees. No tummy issues in our party of 4 so a success!. After a terrible experience with another spray tanning company here in the valley not booking my appointment properly, I was freaking out because I was on a plane to Hawaii the following day and was in serious need of a tan.

I found Mandy online and I definitely lucked out! I called her and she got back to me within 5 minutes and made me an appointment for just a few hours later! I went into her business and was quickly greeted! She was so nice and polite I loved it! Especially after the stress of preparing for a trip, and the terrible customer service I received from the other company (Designer Shades). 

Mandy made me feel completely comfortable, especially considering it was my first spray tan and I was standing in front of her almost completely naked! LOL - She made sure I liked the color before I left and even made my arms a little darker when I told her Id like that! :) 

She has some amazing specials going on right now which I loved! The custom spray tan was less than half of what her competitors are charging with the same, if not BETTER product! I would absolutely recommend Maximum Airbrush Tan to anyone looking for a great experience and even better tan! Thank you, Mandy!!. Thank you to Yonaka, Snow Shavery, and Christina W. for kicking off the first of many delicious monthly lunch feasts.  This was an epic meal for sure, as I needed no food the rest of the day!  The sake tasting was unbelievable, and I found happiness in the Murai Family Daiginjo (green bottle).  I also enjoyed the grapefruit-Thai basil soda concoction as well.

Everything I tasted was pure heaven, from the mushroom and shishito robata with bonito flakes, chicken yakitori sprinkled with green onions, lemon snow and frozen grapes, cured hamachi, fresh scallops, a fried bun with fish and cherries!!!, a whole sea bass with fennel-apple slaw and yucca chips...to a green tea-strawberry-milk-chocolate experience for dessert!

I loved the cantaloupe snow because we all could smell it before it got to the table and it was deliciously powerful.  The whole experience was a journey through flavors that are hard to imagine outside of Yonaka's doors.  We also go to take away a beautiful macaron from Chef Indri.  I think the ideas being executed here in the edible form are nothing short of spectacular, and I am glad to be a part of this lunch's debut!. Our party of 8 made reservations- and our table was ready !
We all ordered different items from menu- 
lobster bisque was so rich and creamy- yum
The reviews from those who had  the Pork chop was  off the charts , along with the rib eye steak and pot roast-
Our entire party enjoyed everything about our meal and time spent at Tripe George- We loved that is just outside the door from our Hotel- The Grand- 
We shall return !. This is exactly the tour guide you want. I promise!  See the fantastic reviews on Trip Advisor. They are all true!! The best!!. The food is great. I love the kiss tacos. So glad I work in the area so I can come for lunch!. Fun and artsy atmosphere! I ordered a White mocha latte over ice. It was delicious! My friend ordered the toddy. She added her own Splenda. i got a sip and it tasted smooth. Very nice coffee. Will defs go back!. I always come here and to Sam's Cafe when I'm in town for business.  I LOVE this place.  Outdoor seating just like Sam's.  

The menu is so diverse with mediterranean food.  I typically get the Gryo pita which never disappoints and is so good and comes with the typical greek salad and also hummus!  I've also gotten the greek salad with calamari or chicken.  Always delicious.  This past time I got the chicken souvlaki which was juicy but for some reason I found it lacking seasoning.  The dolmades were okay, but not that great to rave about.  Same thing with the spanikopita.  

Definitely a place to go to when eating downtown.. We had a great experience when AZ Firemen Movers moved us from Sun City West to Prescott. It was a two day experience, Two crews with same great lead Kyle. Everything went smoothly & we did give them a couple of particularly challenging items to move. Very fair price for exceptional service. Highly recommend them.. This is my favorite restaurant in the valley, and my husband agrees!

Today I had the TLT (Tempeh, Lettuce, and Tomato) with a side of steamed Kale. AWESOME! (Although next time I will ask for no mayo, and was that parmesean on the Kale? Delicious, but I avoid dairy, and try to eat vegan.) Omni hubby went vegan with the steamed vegetables and farro (wheat berries). 

A few months back, we had Sunday brunch there, and I had the scrambled tofu and soy chorizo wrap, which was also very good. 

My only complaint is the popularity of this place means that there is a wait for lunch, even on a 115-degree day. Also, because of the utliltarian kitchen decor and the crowd, it can be noisy. But the food and the service will keep me coming back.. I was researching online all the different lash extension options. I came across iCandy & decided from the before|after pics that they seemed like a great place w| fantastic quality. I was right. 

I made an appointment w| Scarlett not knowing what to expect. What I experienced was awesome. She's super nice & knows what she's doing. Very professional but down to earth. I just adore her. I've since went for about 4 fills after my original set was applied. She's very knowledge and since I take care of my lashes how she recommended (very easy btw) they last & look great. 

Setting appointments is a breeze & when I arrive, she's always punctual & ready to start at the exact time scheduled which is appreciated. The place is clean & very well kept. 

I highly recommend. The price is great for the quality of work. I always fall asleep during my fills, that's how relaxing & wonderful it is.. I'd like to give this place 3.5 stars, but I guess I can round up.

It is a clean little restaurant in a strip mall, with a nice outdoor area complete with fountain. That said, I didn't expect world-class Greek and a wine list.

I ordered the Greek bowl with gyro meat, hubby ordered the gyro with side salad. Then, we sat down to wait.

After a brief wait, we got our order of dolmathes. They were skinny and soaked in oil and, frankly, not that good. But, I'm addicted to Mezze Foods' dolmas, so it would take a miracle to find any worth comparison.

We sipped iced tea and proceeded to wait for dinner.

And wait...

And wait...

And watch both parties that came after us get served...

And wait...

And, just as I heard my husband's stomach actually complain louder than he was whining, the food came.

Lots of it. Fresh and tasty. Absolutely no complaints about food quality - yummy. Plenty of feta and meat, nice crunchy greens, good dressing.

One thing I will say, particularly to those who complained of "too much" cheese on their food: No. Such. Thing. Weirdos. Loved that my salad was nice and cheesy, much like my hubby. :)

 But, worth the wait? Meh.. The juice bar is open 24 hours too!

So I was not able to afford my payments for 24hr Fitness anymore, and joined LVAC. I signed up when they had the special women sign up for $5, and then then according to the package you sign up for, in my case, the basic package, $22 gets ded from my acct every month. 
. 
You have all the classes available to you for no extra charge, and they have more than one class and 3 diff schedules to work around your work day. The mornings are pretty empty and i LIKE it, i feel i have the whole gym to myself. 

If you want to play Racketball, you need to schedule an appt in the book at the front desk b/c its a high demand sport. You have a time limit unfortunately

Towel service is only provided to you if you sign up for it in the package, and they'd know when they scan your card every time you go. 

Personal Trainers are available to you with a package sign up, and if its your first time at a major gym, i recommend a PT. Unless you have someone who goes with you and can assist you. But if you have any questions with machines you can still ask and they will assist you :)

For you busy parents, they do have a daycare that your kids can stay at while you work out and in the womens center and upstairs there are monitors in that are around so you can monitor your kids while you work out.. I stumbled upon this salon several months ago and haven't turned back since. They give excellent manicures and pedicures. Their techs are top notch and friendly. Open late and always willing to take walk-ins... Oh, and affordable! So happy to find this place!. Sat night Birthday celebration! Great lanes, very clean and service to 20 people was excellent! Highly recommend for a different bowling experience. Eric aka Superman provided great beverage & food service.. THEY HAVE THE BEST Mango coconut pancakes!!!!! O to the M G!!! Favorite pancakes EVAAA! you guys rock for late nite yummies!!!. Came for lunch, had the Cuban and a cookie sandwich for dessert (sugar cookie with mango frosting). This place is delicious. The food was incredible, fresh ingredients. Bread was crusty and clearly baked same day. Not sure if it's expensive for Pittsburgh, but I found the price comparable to places in NYC. Would definitely come back...want to try their breakfast.. Went here to try to sell some jewelry. Tiny little place. They couldn't take anything I had but he was 100% honest about how much everything would be retail price. I got lots of good info about what i was working with.  He was just extremely knowledgable and kind. Just a good place all together.. Love this place. Well-made food, great atmosphere. The avocado and heart of palm salad is possibly my favorite thing on the menu (with the exception of their nutella banana empanada). Their gallo pinto is even tastier than the versions I had in Costa Rica. This is an absolute must-try in Mesa.. They've truly earned these 5 Stars. 
-Vegan options (pastries, SOY FREE milk,  hearty wraps)
-Drive Thru
-Agave Nectar Sweetener
-Offer discount for 1st visit (Facebook)
-Quickly and happily rectify any issues you have. They really make you feel like a valued customer
-Clean!!!
-Good prices
-Unlike a lot of veg friendly places I've frequented, their ingredients are ALWAYS fresh! Oh man, i deeply appreciate that!

I always order on the way there because the freshness takes time.  Love the Alien Burrito and Mint Tea.. The patty melt with a green chile add on was great.  It's definitely worth the walk from the downtown area to this little spot.. Great cocktails, food and atmosphere. Definitely happy that this place is in Phoenix. Super hip spot! Service is always great too. There is one male server than is definitely always running his butt off, even during lunch time. You can tell that they take pride in their jobs!. My mom and I were planning on going to Squid Ink but decided to try something new instead. We were pleasantly surprised! The service was excellent, our server greeted us right away, we never ran out of tea or water, and the food came out quickly. We split a chicken bowl, spicy tuna roll, and a tootsie roll. The tootsie was my favorite and my mom loved the spicy tuna! The chicken bowl was delicious as well. All of the ingredients were fresh and tasty. :) We paid 20 for the meal (not including tip). Absolutely a great experience, we will be back here often!. Another 6 star if I could!! No this is not my first time at Firefly so I can write a well rounded review. However, every single time I go to Vegas I make sure that I stop at Firefly for some of their stuffed dates, mar y tierra skewers, their sangria (fave is red) and calamari. This is ohhh so good and it's not uber expensive if you were eating on the strip or a buffet. This last time was for a bachlorette fiesta and we had 13 guests. The drinks were flowing and the food was coming and the bill was less than $400 (with tip). AND we order desert. Not bad if you ask me especially since we had at least 8 pitchers of sangria. 

Hit up Firefly is you want something different that wont cost you mega bucks.. I worked at Planet Hollywood for four years, so I ate here at least three or four times a month, and every time it was great. I really never noticed a markup from other Changs that are located off of the strip. The noodles, rice, and egg drop soup are all fantastic, whether eating at the bar or at a table. Service is quick and good, I would definitely recommend... especially compared to some of the other insanely priced placed to eat on Las Vegas Blvd.. Eric is seriously the bestest. Truly cares about his customers and their welfare. Always leaving here feeling good. These guys really care. Can't say enough good things about them. :) Thanks to everyone here.. My son is enrolled in coach Justin's class. Justin has great patience with the kids, and my son being the cautious child that he is really appreciates that. We love coach Justin and Miss Alexis, they have a great impact on my boys confidence.
I also work at Phoenix Gymnastics Academy and as a teacher admire the skills that these two workers have with the kids. It's all about building confidence and the children having a good time while getting active!. OMG, yes please. So good! I would eat here everyday if it would not cause me to gain weight. I always get praline bacon (AH-maxing), a ham and cheese croissant (croissants just as good as in Paris), and beignets (not quite the same as in NOLA, but I'll still eat them!). I like to think if I walk here from my house it helps offset the calories.. This place is okay. It's merchandised very nicely. I wanted so badly to buy something here but nothing really floated my boat. Also, the pricing was a little weird. I felt like some things were overpriced. Overall it was neat to look at everything and worth checking out. I will come back and see how it matures (I'm told the store is somewhat new).. I just finished my first visit to this location. Once I moved to Phoenix, I did some yelp hunting and came across the European Wax Center. I love the affordable price, reliable quality, flexible scheduling and professional atmosphere. Glenda did a superb job and is a personable, knowledgable and talented esthetician. I just found "my" eyebrow place!. Cute neighborhood shop with both new and used women's and (some) men's. They seem to have recently refocused on more vintage and second hand clothing and dropped their prices accordingly. They also feature local clothing, jewelry and fashion designers, as well as a bargain basement of fabrics and off season clothing. Only knocking a star for occasionally being a bit overpriced, and inconsistent service-sometimes friendly sometimes not.. I have used the carpet rental machines from Fry's to clean my carpets for years. I'd rent the carpet machine and bust by butt trying to clean my carpets myself and have to drag the heavy machine back to the store.  I decided to use Abracadabra Carpet Cleaners after a neighbor suggested this company to me. Needless to say, I will never rent a carpet cleaner machine again! Not only were the service guys  professional and  hard workers, but the price was reasonable. I have highly recommended this company to family, friends and even co-workers! They provide awesome Service!. What a gem!  This place is a little hidden in the same shopping center as Lee Lee's Asian market, so I had to really look to find it.  

We had the egg and vegetable noodle soup, the fried dumplings and the chicken fried noodles.  You can really tell that they make their own noodles.  Delicious!  Don't let the picture on the menu fool you, their portions are HUGE!  

I have to second the comments about the amazing service.  Everyone was prompt and polite, and I love that I could see into the kitchen as my noodles were made.  I now have firsthand knowledge of how clean their kitchen is.  

I would not hesitate to recommend this place to someone wanting Chinese food that's authentic and a little out of the norm!. I've been wanting to try this place for a very long time and we finally did.  It's wasn't what I expected, which was just a regular burger place.  It's actually a 50's style diner!  I love that!   A variety of burgers with endless and free toppings and the hundreds of shake combinations will never bore you.   I've never seen so many before.  I definitely plan on going back for just shakes only.  The burger I ordered was good, and cooked exactly as I requested.  And I love love love their beer battered onion rings.  Good food and good service overall.. I needed to have my home cleaned because my parents are coming for Thanksgiving. I got a recommendation to call Maidpro Cleaning service to clean my home and I have nothing but praises for their work and customer service. I had the cleaning service set up early and met with the cleaning staff.  The staff from Maid Pro were very pleasant, informative and professional, especially the lady who spoke to me over the phone. As a matter of fact, it was she who arranged the schedule and sent to me their best cleaners. The cleaners worked really hard to get my place all cleaned up. They even sanitized one room that was vacant for a long time. I will surely call up this company again.. The service and the food was excellent. We had Kevin as our waiter. He made wonderful recommendations. We both got the 18oz bone in Ribeye and it was cooked to perfection. The lobster bisque was to die for!!. If you like spicy food this is the right place to go to. The lunch menu is an extremely good deal!! Cheap!! The only downside is that the food taste is not always consistent.. Me and 2 best friends were in town for a girls' getaway weekend in the beginning of this month & I was due for a massage.  One of my best friends never had a professional massage, so I definitely wanted to find a place that would deliver that total spa package experience.

I loved everything about Verve.  It's nicely decorated and the staff was super friendly.  We were served warm sparkling cider too!  Such a perfect drink to give us since it was cold and rainy!  The only con I have is that it took a while to get a massage because there was another party upstairs getting full-on pampered.

The owner, Verbena, was the one who actually gave me my hour long massage.  IT WAS THE BEST MASSAGE I'VE EVER GOTTEN.  She listened to my concerns (I was getting over a cold and I had neck/shoulder problems at the time) very well and if I lived in Charlotte, I would be there every month.  Every week if I could!. I really enjoyed my stay at Treasure Island. Although, yes there is a resort fee per night. But I read other reviews so no shock, sucks though since we didn't even use any of those amenities minus the internet. 
So anyways the hotel room itself was great, the beds were so comfy (which is great if you were walking around all day and just wanted to crash right after!)
It fit everyone nicely, our room was very clean when we got on. Check in and check out want that.bad like most have said and I was here for the weekend too. Great place to stay if you don't want to shell out hundreds and hundreds of bucks for a room, and its pretty close to the lively middle part of the strip. Good stay :). I seriously have never had a fruit cup that tasted as good as that fruit cup did. It was ridiculous how much I liked it. The sandwich was good too! I don't like sweet tea but I make an exception for McAlister's. The only reason McAlister's loses a star from me is that the service was super slow. The line to order took forever and it took kind of long to get my club sandwich out. 

But man, that fruit cup was good.. I've been here four times & it is amazing!! If you've never done threading I highly recommend, and the staff ease you into it! I'm embarrassed that I don't know her name, but I'm pretty sure she owns the place she is wonderful! I swear she treats me like her daughter I love it, she remembers me every time I  come in, and they even have a punch card where after 6 times you get a discount, not like you need it! It is so reasonable! They have a package where lip and eyebrow is only $13. I don't live nearby anymore, but I still make the drive just to come here I absolutely recommend!!. Went there for happy hour last night. Amazing! We had the pork belly grilled cheese, parmesan fries and roasted brussel sprouts. Everything was delicious. I have always hated brussel sprouts but I am now a convert. I would go back just for those alone. Happy hour is a great deal. Drinks are a little limited but we mostly went for the food so we did not mind. Definitely recommend for anyone who likes interesting food. Best bar food I have ever had.. Nice place. Clean and modern, simplistic decor. Only giving four rather than five stars because the vegetarian pho was made with chicken broth. I was really looking forward to a big bowl of yummy pho, but last time I checked vegetarians don't eat chicken. The waiter, however, was super nice and I appreciate that he told me about the broth before I ordered and he helped me find something I could eat instead. (I had a rice vermicelli bowl w/o fish sauce instead -yum!) Great, small local beer selection and good happy hour prices. Didn't sit on the patio, but it looked nice especially for the cooler AZ days. Try to sit near the front of the restaurant if you don't want to be near the dish bussing station.. I am not even a big wine drinker but I still love this place. The atmosphere is great and the snacks and toasted sandwiches are super good!. All Holidays are 50% off red tags!  Red tagged items are the higher end/brand name merchandise.

Sunday there are always 2 colors that are 50-75% off and I get most all of my little girls clothes here for $.75- $1.00 for Justice, Circo, Roxy, American Eagle, GAP, and Hollister brands.  For shoes I've picked up several cute sandals, the popular Twinkle Toe Sketchers, and even Steve Madden boots for $3-$5.

Clothes are organized by color so if you need a particular color it's really convenient.  The racks are separated by Men, Women, and Kids.  

You have to do some digging but I always find a treasure or two here!. We were told that we should give this place a shot for brunch upon our arrival at Caesar's Palace so we did.  We were very interested in the twist it had in breakfast/brunch foods so we were sat down and given a chance to look through the menu and they had some different items.  I even took a chance to look at Yelp to see what some of these inventions were.  We ended up ordering the spicy scrambled eggs and the sweet potato hash.  Both were really good and we enjoyed our meals. Would recommend.. One of the nicer places I've stated at over the past 18  years I've been going to Vegas. The rooms, are very nice. Room service is great, especially after hitting the  casinos! The casino is  very nice as well as the shops and restaurants. Highly recommend!. facility was calm, clean, and fantastic. prices aren't too bad... i mean, it's vegas after all. i like that they provide you with lots of fruits and drinks. :)

i came for the aria signature massage and scrub add-on. they gave me Mitch. Mitch was absolutely FABULOUS!!! his hands are seriously made of gold! this is by far, the BEST massage I've ever had!! and I'm not exaggerating either. I've had so many massages, no one comes remotely close. can I bring him home with me? anyway, he was perfect... i asked him if he used oil (i hate oil) and he said he used lotion only. it's better because our skin gets so dry in the desert heat anyway. 

during my spa session, he checked up on me ever so often and he made sure the pressure wasn't too much for me to handle. he didn't try to chit chat during my session either! pure awesomeness. he even hooked me up with a little container of salt scrub after we were done! 

i really can't wait to come back to see Mitch!. I've been a fan of Sage Kitchen since it grew out of Chakra 4 and it warms my soul a little more every time I visit.  I've had long winding lunches and quick sips here, and found that the staff is always accommodating. The delicious teas and healthful dishes are great when you're feeling good and simply awesome when you're feeling under the weather or otherwise in a funk.  Sage Kitchen is good for the body and spirit!. We got a gift certificate from my inlaws that she had won and wouldn't use. THANK GOD! This place is a hidden gem, for sure. I had the Gruyere Burger which was amazing (although overcooked- I asked for medium and there was no pink, but it was so good I didn't care) and my husband had the Polish Sausage with saeurkraut and bacon. We had the soft pretzel appetizer and shared a small order of fries. Everything was amazing. Nothing outdid something else...I can't pick a favorite. 

Four stars instead of five because of the wait staff. You should never have to even ask for a drink refill at 2pm in a bar on a Monday, let alone wait 10 minutes to even get the chance to ask while another server walks by your table also and doesn't even look over. Otherwise our experience was great and we will likely be back.. Stumbled upon this gem quite by chance while walking around with a friend. We were uninspired when we stopped to look at the menu so we entered without any huge expectations. But we were very pleasantly surprised. Everything was just right: the staff, the interior, the overall ambiance... But the food...it was just amazing. The spices, the flavors, were nothing like anything I've ever tasted and I loved that.. Exceptional quality buffet! It's everything you hope a buffet will be, and you will leave there very satified. Amost everything is made in individual portions... no big trays full of slop here! Pricey, but worth it!. Great ambience and food.. I love Church Brew Works and come here often. They have some great brews and some not so great brews, but they have something for everyone. Their best brews (in my opinion) are the Belgian Tripel, the Mole Stout, the Coconut Stout, and the Dunkel. 

I've only eaten off of the bar menu, but I find the food to be consistently good. The pizzas are especially excellent. 

The service is sometimes spotty, but the servers are doing the best they can and are good about communicating about delays. There is one bartender who is kind of a jerk.

The ambiance is great. It's a stunning location that was the neighborhood's Catholic church for years. The stained glass windows are especially great. For those of you complaining about the smell - it's a brewery! That's what it smells like when they are brewing. 

My only complaint is that they sometimes close early at night depending on the crowd.

The takeaway growlers are a great value.. This place doesn't beat Thai Style Noodle House but it isn't too bad at all. I ordered the Koaw mun gai which is the steamed rice topped with boiled chicken with the Special Sauce. First of all most thai restuarants do not ever have this on the menu. i was very surprised they had this. I used to eat this all the time on the streets of thailand after going to clubs. It his the spot. The Sauce which is the main ingredient was perfect! The clear soup that always goes with this dish was flavorful which complimented this dish. 

My girlfriend ordered the Kaow Soi beef. Egg noodles in coconut milk and curry powder and beef (Northern Thai Style) and she said it was so delicious. I didn't get a chance to try it but it looked good. She ate the whole bowl of it. 

Great service, modern, and clean.. As a family with kids is hard to find a restaurant to please all the taste buds but Nush knocks it out off the park!
We went a Friday night with my family of three kids. The kids had the Nush fries with the dip and it was gone in seconds. They also had the linguine spinach pasta so tasty!
I had the rosted vegetable salad with the dressing that was perfect my husband  had the chicken kabob that they were tender and delicious.
Service was friendly and so helpful with menu suggestions!. The bf and I were able to go through the Titanic exhibit just a few hours before our flight left, and we both agreed that it was one of the best parts of our Vegas trip!

The Tix4Tonight deal is the real thing - I think they were $16/ea with a $3/ticket fee. All in all, we paid much less than full price.

The exhibit itself was breathtaking! They designed it in a manner when you walk through the 3rd class, then 2nd class, then 1st class, and even out on the promenade deck! The character of each room was amplified by the artifacts pulled up from the Atlantic - some intriguing, some haunting. Some are in great condition and really let you see what they were in their glory. Others have decayed after years on the sea floor, but really add an additional dimension to the exhibit.

Oh, did I mention THE GRAND STAIRCASE?!?!?! Heck yes it's here!! They'll take your picture on it, but we passed, taking in the glamor and stateliness of the staircase.

Play some slots, win enough for admission to this exhibit, and experience it take your breath away!. Found a beer that I simply LOVE from Birdsong. They have a jalapeno variety ( I can't remember but it was probably a Pale Ale) that they simply need to put into regular rotation! It was one of my favorite beers at Brew Fest and paired very well with a nice sharp cheddar.. Just moved to the area and went on the hunt for a new nail salon. Once I find "my place" I am very loyal. Walked in to Cleopatra Nails at 10 am the Monday after the 4th of July and was greeted right away, offered a bottle of water, seated and given one of the best pedicures I have ever had! I teach cosmetology so I know what a pedicure should and should not consist of. The massage was heavenly, my nails look great and I am happy. Found my new place!. Short wait, polite and the way the girl threads my hair doesn't grow back as fast as usual.. This was BY FAR the happiest of accidental finds. The food was delicious, the decor was inviting and sophistically relaxed, and my manhattan...return-worthy. Absolutely the best pizza!  Salads, meatballs, olives...you name it - everything is 5 stars here.. I LOVE this bar!  This is a wonderful place to go with a mixed group of people that want to have fun and meet lots of crazy people.  I've met some crazy people here and I always have fun!  Drinks are well priced and never weak.  I've taken lots of out of town friends here and everyone has loved it!

This is a must stop in Scottsdale!. Tasty sushi for a very good price. The quantity was spot on. The staff was extremely friendly but the service seemed a little slow based on how many sushi chefs were working at the time.. Oh nooo! Jean-Baptiste (massage therapist) is no longer with Joya!. NO BUTTER. It's the way to do it. It's how the Louisiana people eat it. And you won't get they nasty fatigue oily feeling after you eat a bag of whatever. 

Everything is great here. I love their Cajun fries. Nice and crispy. Their oysters are pretty good. They were a little tasteless but felt fresh. 

I recommended the shrimp and the crawfish. They are usually market price and range from $10 to $13. FYI medium is pretty spicy! 

My only complaint is they they over cooked our crab. I mean the one time I decide to order it. When I went to break the leg, it literally just bent? The meat also was falling part all stringy. Come on!. Never got a bad meal here. It's very fresh and tasty.  Margaritas are delicious and strong.  You won't get a lot of ambiance here,  but the food is worth it.. This was our second time to use Warren's Homework.  They are punctual and very careful with all of your belongings.  Nothing was broken.  They move fast and take  no breaks. If we move again we will definitely use their services.. I'm proud of Honey Salt. Proud of it's neighborhood chic, it's lovely decor, and of course, the food. This is a great off-the-strip place to take visitors.

For an appetizer, we tried the new england fry. The menu said it was clams and calamari, but I think there was only calamari. Not really a problem, but some notification would have been nice so I don't analyze my food wondering which is which. "I'm pretty sure clams don't have spindly legs or look like O's." Deductive reasoning at it's finest.

He had the caramelized sea scallops over a vanilla cauliflower puree and also a truffle sauce. The hint of vanilla and truffle provided a lovely earthy note.

I had the mediterranean sea bass over roasted mushrooms and wilted spinach. Perfectly crunchy skin with flakey moist fish, flavorful mushrooms and spinach. Just perfect, perfect, perfect!

Overall, I wouldn't order the new england fry again unless I was specifically craving fried calamari, but the entrées will surely be repeated again someday and suggested to others.. the shit. i live above across the street and this is my mecca, theres dancing if you wanna dance, dive bar mentality if you wanna chill and couches and shit if you wanna do that vip bullshit thing. i love finns, service is ON POINT. keep doing you boys.. Food is fresh tasty and fast.  And pretty healthy, the service is great our food is alway hot and fresh. I love this place and highly recommend it.. Delish!  Loved the crunchy cinnamon French toast.  The bacon was great also.  Portions are HUGE.  Will definitely go again.. I had an amazing massage here today.  My therapist was Reginad, and he gave me the perfect amount of pressure.  Normally, I have a tough time getting therapists to give me the pressure I want.  In fact Reginald went over my trouble spots, what my likes and dislikes were before the session started, to ensure I would have the type of massage I wanted.  My favorite part was the part where he my temples and my scalp.... So good! I have had massages and treatments done at most strip properties in some of the best rated spas in Las Vegas and this place impressed me! Plus the spa is clean and nicely decorated. I'll be back for sure.. Come here for:
Crab legs, shrimp, beef, desserts. Thats all. 

Bad sushi, bad selection for kosher peeps who don't eat pork or shellfish, and generally just not worth it UNLESS you eat the 4 items listed above exclusively.. I've used Arizona School of Real Estate & Business for appraisal classes for close to 10 years, so when I decided to get my real estate license, this school was my obvious choice. Still, I was surprised by their level of professionalism and the depth of knowledge of the instructors. I definitely recommend!. I have been wanting to try this place ever since I saw the sign while running errands. I always order the same entree every time I have Indian food which is the dal makhani. I ordered the mild which was a bit watery and not very spicy at al compared to the other times that I have had it. The rest of the food that we ordered were great. Very good service and great atmosphere. I will be back will just order something different.. I have now visited Herb n' Flavors several times. I love supporting local businesses who have sustainable practices. This place uses local farms for their produce, safe from GMO's and pesticides. So, I was already a fan before I walked in! Everything I have tried has been delicious, and the owner is such a cool guy- always so friendly to the customers. The food always tastes so fresh, and full of flavor! They have a little something for everyone. I am a gluten free vegan and my husband has no dietary restrictions. We always both leave happy. I definitely recommend this place. I would like to see their business continue to grow and stick around for a long time! :). Went last night before the D-Backs game. It was packed but very well staffed. By looking at some of the older reviews, I think the place likely got the hint that they need to better staff themselves. Love the Pear Cider beer. Got the Irish Nachos...they were pretty good. Atmosphere is defiantly similar to a Hooter's.. went back for the little guy's birthday after his first game of miniature golf the dinner request 'hot dogs!'...still delicious, still super friendly, still worth the drive.. This was an amazing show and a must see.   I was laughing so hard I was crying and then the next second in awe of the acrobatics.  Hands down greats how.. It's a bit pricey, and the portions are small. I had bruschetta, it was yummy. I had the vegetarian risotto, which was amazing! I spent $60, and the waitress forgot about me, waited nearly 30 minutes for her to pick up my payment. I had two glasses of wine and I'm a light weight so I hadn't noticed that much time had pasted, the book I was reading kept me entertained.. yogurt land is the most amazing thing EVER!!

some people say its the same as ice cream... YOU ARE WRONG
yogurt is so much healthier then ice cream ^^

anyways short review:

Friendly staff
best quality yogurt
best quality toppings

all yogurtlands deserve a five star rating. Awesome place. It is like a Chipotle but for pizza.
Choose your toppings, get the pie made, everything is one standard price.

The crust is great, but what really does it is the sauce. The pizza sauce is amazing. 

Go here! if you haven't already.. Go here! And you will feel like a pizza artist, just making your custom pizzas and smiling away!. Studio B Buffet has to be one of my favorite buffets in Vegas! I went here on Saturday for lunch with my family that was visiting me from California. I paid about $180 for their seafood lunch for 4 people. If you are going with a group be ready to shell out quite a bit of money..but when is that ever new in Vegas? I was not upset with the price because I knew the buffet would be worth it.

Upon entering you will see a vast array of food spread out before you. A word of buffet  wisdom: scan around and then take a little bit of what looks appealing, and figure out your favorites. Believe me. You will want to keep eating everything there.  Everything that they have available from the crab legs to the fruit is fresh and flavorful. One of my favorite things that I tried was the prime rib. The prime rib is usually generously served and very juicy. Definitely something you want to try if you're a meat lover. Another great option that they have there is their kalbi ribs. The kalbi ribs are cooked perfectly and are very huge. I don't think I have ever seen kalbi ribs so big! 

If you aren't a fan of beef, they have various pasta choices that you can try that are very delicious. If they have mushroom ravioli available, I definitely recommend you try it. The cream sauce and ravioli filling will make you go "Mmmmm" from the first bite! Their crab legs are always being refilled because everyone loves them so much! They are all pretty big and have a good amount of crab meat in them. In addition, they have various fruits to choose from that look and taste juicy and sweet. 

Studio B Buffet is definitely one of the best buffets in Vegas that is actually worth the price. If you are looking for a great buffet away from the strip, this is your place! I promise, it won't disappoint you. 

**Be sure if you do plan on coming here during a weekend that you get there early. The buffet gets pretty packed and the line is usually really long, so plan your dinner or lunch accordingly**. This place was great fun! Contrary to a few reviews, the skates were in excellent condition, the place was very spacious and clean, the employees were very nice.  My kids had never skated before and they had a great time.. I've been seeing Lauren at Rumors for almost two years now and she is AMAZING. Not only is she a serious hair wizard, she is super friendly and efficient. She made me super blonde today and my hair looks and feels great!. This 'demi' coffee shop (petite, if you will) recently changed hands from The Mud Dauber/Lofi.  Current management has made changes in both ambiance and menu. Note: they use organic dairy, setting the tone for their philosophy on all else served.. A shop filled with things I want but don't need? If it's wrong to spend time here, I don't want to be right.

It's not big, it doesn't have a ton of stuff, but it works. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by things to look at, I can take my time looking over everything.  And by some form of wizardry, everything in this store turns out to be something I want.

Great place to take someone when you've got a birthday coming up so you can point out all the things you wouldn't buy yourself.. I went to this restaurant for my friend's wedding ceremony. I had outstanding experience there. Food, service and stomophere was all great. I would go back again when I visit Las Vegas. I can't forget the time I spend there.. This place gives either huge or a lot of food. So worth the bucks and the wait in line. What most people say, "where the cops are, you know its good food". Well, surely this place is where they go. My bf introduced me to this place and said it's the only place he knows of NOW that serves  teriyaki chicken with the skin on it. The fat on the skin is what makes teriyaki chicken sooo good. I'm not usually a musubi fan, so we ordered one  to share. Turned out I ended up eating 3/4ths of it and my bf wasn't too happy that I ate all of his masubi. 

Can't wait to come back to Vegas for more teriyaki chicken and musubi's!!. Dan Bakley is very knowledgeable. He can provide you a very clear picture on where your health insurance gaps and what additional coverage you need. And it's so inexpensive! His insurance services he provides gives you cash immediately when your need arises. It's dirt cheap to fill in the gap! You won't regret speaking with Dan.. Perfectly cooked pasta is very hard to find but Gina's had it! A quaint AND inexpensive  place to eat, we had the spaghetti with meatballs and veal and eggplant parm. Gina's got off to a good start with a VERY fresh and largely piled bed of leaf lettuce mix and lightly covered in a homemade vinaigrette. Al dente pasta, thin cut eggplant and veal  with fresh ingredients which was comforting with a little kick to it and reminded us of our Italian grandmother's cooking! Best homemade cannoli in town!!! Add two glasses of merlot and we left just under $65.00!. Had an awesome time this day, lounge around the VIP area since my group was hanging there. Service was prompt, our cocktail waitresses are super awesome & beautiful and music was on point. Only thing I didn't like, there was a white girl scamming people so watch out for her. She'll try to blend in with your group even though our group was a bunch of asian girls. I wished TAO Beach had a secluded jacuzzi layout as Marquee, but I still had a good time.. This place is great for group/family outings.
We sat outside on the patio with a large group; the misters and fans really helped with keeping it comfortable on an August evening.
There were a ton of kids there on a Saturday night and a ton of dogs.

Love the vibe and decor!

Soooo, this is where you lose me a bit because..well....a dog sitting on the patio chairs, with their paws and bodies on the tables where people eat? um, EWWW.
Look, I love animals..but I need some boundaries. I don't want dog slobber or hair in my food or on my clothes. 
I didn't see one dog in the designated dog area, but I saw a ton of dogs on and around tables and chairs. It was just. gross. I love dogs...really I do!

Anyway-my food was ok. I'm not a fan of sweet bread, and the bun on my turkey burger was sweet (maybe a potato bun)? Fries were over salted. I ended up taking the bun off and trying wrap my burger with the ton of greens that were on the burger (no easy task).

Our server, Tasha, was awesome!! Kept our drinks coming and our waters filled-and was super friendly.. I've been to XS twice and loved it both times. The first time, the main inside club area was closed for a private party, so that blew, but this time it was open.

Inside: BEAUTIFUL decor, BEAUTIFUL lighting. I love the rich colors and gold. The chandelier is beautiful, and I love the gold female figures that point their boobies at you no matter where you're standing. It can definitely get a bit crowded in there, but it was fun to dance on the actual dance floor before heading outside. The bar was busy of course, but drinks were actually pretty strong for a club. Music was just ok. 

Outside: The best part of this club. My girls and I were feet first in the pool in our hot dresses, dancing together with no one bugging us or poking their wieners at us. Yay for no weiner poking! Literally inside one of my friends had an awkward encounter with a boner. Overeager much? 

The pool is stunning, the view of the Wynn is great and you can play table games also. They had a girl dancing with glowy things, which was fun to watch. People watching was also awesome. The lighting outside makes it much easier to spot the sloppy drunk hot messes. SO fun!. This place is a must go to chill and drink good wine. They usually have a live band and great ambiance. A really good wine selection and some tasty food. I like the 3 cheese fondue and street tacos. Their flatbreads are alright.. This was our first time eating here (delivery) and we weren't disappointed. Delivery was within an hour and the pizza was original. We will be ordering delivery again

We ordered again the white pizza and ckn wings. Food was just as good this time around. I'm definitely no expert on Vietnamese cuisine, but I like to consider myself an adventurous eater. I've had good experiences with the sort of "Asian fusion" noodle houses that you can find in most cities, and being new to Madison, I wanted to give this little Vietnamese place a try. 

Wow, we were not disappointed. Because it is one of the most traditional Vietnamese dishes, I wanted to try the pho. We could hardly believe our taste buds. The broth was rich and flavorful, and the accoutrements served along with the pho were fresh and tasty. The beef was thinly sliced and pink in the middle. What a treat. We've been back several times since - this is the sort of place that's good enough to cause random cravings. I've been other places to try pho since, and I haven't found anything to compare. Do check this place out!. Superb Pumpkin Cupcake. This is my third time doing a club crawl but first time using sin city club crawls and they are definitely the best! I had gone on a crawl Thursday 5/15/14 and had an awesome time. Unfortunately I don't remember our hosts names but they were both super friendly and did a great job leading the group. Super smooth time going from club to club and so much fun on the DOUBLE DECKER party bus!! Compared to other companies I've used this one is by far the nicest and most organized. There is another company out there that advertises as the cheapest but if you use the Yelp promo code from here they are the same price and Sin City is definitely the way to go! Also, we had gone to clubs that were actually somewhat newer to the newest one (Hakasaan) which is pretty much unlikely on other crawls as they tend to take you to the clubs that have been there for around for a while. You meet at a lounge/typical bar place and receive one well drink and get to meet others doing the crawl. You then head to the bus and receive what seems like a cranberry vodka mix for the bus ride, as many as you'd like, on your way to the next club. You have set times and places to meet outside of the club to go on to the next one, the hostess also walked around with a specific glow stick indicating it was time to move on. You do this until you get to the final club which you are then responsible for finding your way home. You can also stay at any of the clubs you choose. I've been to vegas several times and always do at least one night of these club crawls because of how convenient and easy it is to see 3 clubs in one night without the hassle, and just a fun time overall because you're with a group of people all in the same mind set. If you're looking for a club crawl company to use, believe me, this one is it!!. Great experience - hotel is charming and clean.  Our room was comfortable and nicely decorated.  Staff was very helpful.  Great location too.. Great food and drink! Great atmosphere! To die for Bruschetta and fantastic specials throughout the week. I only wish the restaurant was bigger to accommodate more people as it is not uncommon to have to wait quite a while for a table and there is really no where to sit or really even stand while you wait. However, the staff is great at getting you a drink while you wait either at the bar or if you're lucky enough to get a spot at one of their standing room only tables.. awesome food with great service! I love this place! the only thing I think is a little annoying is when their "experience captains" come around, Im just trying to enjoy my food and conversations! Other than that everything is wonderful!!. I was very pleased with the friendly service, short wait and the thoroughness of the dr. Facility was very clean and welcoming aswell.. Good food - friendly service     The Cajun food was delicious.     The restaurant staff was attentive and the food was sooooo good. Went to see the RACE exhibit as today was the last day. Absolutely lovely! So detailed and informative that if it did not incite you to think about the concept of race in this country, how you respond to races, your concept of race, how you treat races, and your place in this society based on your race...than you're a lama.. This is THE best sushi I've ever had. They have very very generous portions, and great prices. The octopus is delicious. But my favorite of the night was the scallop roll. 

The service was good, it was pretty dead in there when we came in and we got attended to very quickly. Even when the place started getting busy our server Gary was excellent. Will definitely be coming here again, hopefully sooner than later.. De l'extérieur, le bar est à peine visible, un petite porte discrète juste à côté de la file pour la Banquise. 
Mais à l'intérieur, l'endroit est bien plus impressionnant : des hauuuts plafonds, une lumière tamisée, des grandes tables, une décoration sortie tout droit sortie d'un Marvel. Et un DJ pour la musique !

Pour ce qui est de la carte : des cocktails à n'en plus finir, et ils valent le détour !! 
Coté prix, il est à noter que les cocktails maison sont à 7$ jusqu'à 9pm ! Et que le vestiaire est gratuit, seul le tip est à payer !

Bref, un bon bar bien sympa où nous reviendrons pour sûr !!. I always have a good time here. I normally come for happy hour but have also gone for brunch on Saturday and bottomless mimosas - awesome! I've had almost everything on their small plates menu and it's never failed.. Definitely a solid 4 stars for Daisho Sushi!!! 
We usually don't venture out to this side of town but after seeing so many delicious pictures posted by @aznttboy on my Instagram feed, we had to come check it out! 
Came on a Saturday morning so we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves..
Nice clean & open space. They are located in the same plaza as Walmart-neighborhood. 

My boyfriend went with the lunch AYCE while I paid a couple bucks extra and went with the dinner price.. I wanted to sample all the special 1per person/dinner only items..
-Oysters / were good!
-Yellowtail Poki / came on a bed of seaweed salad and was very good! You can also get tuna or salmon poki..
-Miso Cod / buttery and sweet! watch out for the bones though!
-Yakitori Skewers / we got bacon wrapped asparagus, enoki mushrooms, quail eggs & the tuna... These things are huge.. 2 sticks come in 1 order so don't order too much! Bacon anything is delicious although I would have liked the bacon to be a little bit more crisp.
-Nigiri / Everything was decently fresh and we didn't run into anything horrible but the standouts for me were the scallops and fatty albacore! mmmmmM
-Wild Fire Roll / (no rice) spicy tuna, tuna, albacore & soy paper.. Loved the presentation! 
-Miso Soup / seemed a bit watered down & they don't offer the option to add the shrimp head to it.
-Dessert / we had the standard green tea ice cream & yuzu sorbet.. hopefully they add some more creative desserts to the menu!

Service was fast from our server although sometimes it seemed there was a language barrier but he was very efficient. The sushi chef who helped us was nice and kept the conversation going and the food a-flowing.. Forgot his name but he likes to play golf and he is from S. Carolina LOL

HOT TIP: Ask for a stamp card!!!! 
Watching what you eat? No problem, they have like 6 non rice rolls + several fish only appetizer items.. Fresh Cup is great! Naturally, it is among the many new and awesome places my husband and I have discovered just weeks before we move out of state. OH WELL.

I like the strawberry banana smoothie with boba (it is very fresh and juicy and craveable) and they have a large selection of tasty food, as well. My husband tried their sushi and enjoyed it very much, and I got an order of agedashi tofu which was delicious, as well.

I will be back for more boba and tasty treats before we move!. CC where have you been all my life?? This is THE place to find that item you need to dress up your outfit. It is reasonable so you don't feel bad only using it once or only for one outfit. Whoever thought of this concept is a genius.. I made a wrong turn to avoid an accident scene on Baseline Road...GOOD THING! I found Panchos!  This place is super cheap and super delicious!  I usually order the El Crudo burrito ($6.45 only!) and I love the Mole sauce!  The burrito is stuffed with Machacha beef and comes with rice and some lettuce...the sauce is the best Mole sauce I have ever had.  

I have never had to wait for my food. Although the parking lot can get packed. This place is amazing. if I'm ever in phoenix again on business I'm going here!  

Love it. 

btw, I was on  mission to find some bomb ass Mexican food and was somewhat disappointed. People kept referring me to Filbertos.  WTF Go to PANCHOS!. I usually don't write reviews but my experience at this restaurant was super good that its a most for me to share it with everyone. The food is very tasty, just as I expected from a seafood restaurant. I got the all you can eat catfish and my husband got the snow crab meal! Very tasty and filling! The salad bar is fresh and have a lot of verity. Our waiter penny was super friendly and helpful. Will be back for sure!. YUUUUUUMMMM!!!! I asked my friend to take me to a Thai restaurant for my birthday dinner and she took me here. The Thai Iced Tea that we started with was delicious! We got the Thai Eggrolls as an appetizer, and they were the tastiest eggrolls I've tried. I was very impressed. We ordered the Coconut Soup with chicken and a side of steamed rice as our starter and it was AMAZING!! The flavors were so delicious and the server told us the ingredients used to make it so my friend could try recreating it at home. We didn't even finish the soup before we were full, but we couldn't stop there. We ordered an order of Pad Thai with chicken and tofu to take home and it was very tasty too! My only suggestion is that you go with your gut on the heat level. If you think you are a champion heat eater (or if you can't get enough of spicyness) go for the hot. I found the medium to not satisfy my heat craving, but their tray of spices accommodated for that. I wish I had room for their desserts, as I read many great reviews about them, but with their reasonable prices for everything, I'll definitely be able to go back again on a regular basis and try all of their dishes. A MUST go restaurant!. You can't go far wrong with Imo really, they're the best when it comes to washing cars (apart from my mum, she has the knack). 
They market themselves as being the cheapest carwash around, and I quite believe they are. They have different choices for your car at different prices - ranging from around £2 to £6.50. You can't deny, they do a good job. You can either chose to get it hand-washed by them or through the machine. Go for the machine - they have multicoloured foam! I know it's kinda childish, but there's something magical about being surrounded by pink, blue, green and yellow foam. It's like I'm in a bah of skittles.. I had salad De Ville. Yes I ordered a salad at a burger joint. But it was delicious! Topped with loads of goat cheese, pecans, and cramberries. Homemade dressing was yummy. Very well priced.
Great service!. What a lovely shop!  Extremely well trained, highly educated, friendly and attentive staff.  No pressure sales from these two knowledgeable gentleman.  I am very pleased with the service I received and love the fragrance I purchased.  Definitely worth a stop and sniff.. If an artist or act comes to town, you can't help the performance location. That's set. But if you happen to see an artist or act that you're interested in and it's happening at Comerica Theater, be in for a treat. There are no bad seats here. Every seat offers a great view. I've seen Alice Cooper's Christmas Pudding, and I've also seen Incubus, and both shows were enjoyed.

Look at that theater. That is a nice theater.. 3/31/11: delicious pasta with butternut squash & brussel sprouts! Excellent service - I appreciate it when my server checks table without being obtrusive. And, it's a Pepsi place! :). Great customer service.  I called in to order 6 coffees.  Got to the store and only 4 were correct.  Geez.  The lady apologized.  She gave me all I wanted.  My order!  Then a manager gave me a $10 gift card for the trouble.  Thank you for keep customers happy.. Highly recommend this lovely spot! First impression is deceiving when you enter the shopping center. Don't hesitate to park and go in! The entire place is clean and comfortable. The staff is polite and helpful. The Food was delicious. The vegetables were fresh and crispy, the rice done to perfection and the sauces on both my partners Pad Thai and my stir fry were tasty without being overdone. In other words the food wasn't soaked in it. 
The price was right also.. This LongHorn Steakhouse is one of my favorite chain restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. My husband and I have dined here several Sunday afternoons when we were craving a delicious steak. Service has ranged from average to good. The food has always been excellent though! I always say that I'm going to have "just one" slice of that amazing Honey Wheat bread and then I end up eating half of a loaf. I love the 9 oz Flo's Filet Steak, cooked Medium Rare. Delicious! I'm sure we'll be back soon when we have another steak craving.. It was an unbelievable experience
It is the only Michelin 3 star hotel in Las Vega and by extension the best restaurant in Vegas - supposed to be ;)
But they really do treat u like Royalty!
The Restaurant is very tastefully opulent and they feed u so much food!
They had these choices - so we picked almost the cheapest for $200 each
and then u add the wine and service etc..
So we went for the fixed price Appetizer and main course menu
But they served us so much extra stuff - started with a fancy Amuse Bouche then a Bread cart with like 50 different varieties of bread and then they surprised us with a candle lit Anniversary Cake. But wait there's more - they bought this huge cart of the most delicious truffles and mini desserts!

Really memorable experience!. My fiancé and I went to Denny's while in Tempe for the weekend. It was located right by our hotel. Our waiter was really nice and attentive. The food was also good. I ordered one of the skillets and I was really impressed. If you are staying at the double tree hotel in Tempe, give Denny's a try.. I only lived there for 6 months and yes, it had some cons, but I still I liked it there. First the cons..
My cons: 
1. My apartment didn't have a balcony, which I would have loved. ..but I knew that when I signed my lease.
2. After the carpet stains began resurfacing after their pre move in cleaning, it was FILTHY. Def should've been replaced. I couldn't walk barefoot in my own home. And grouping in w the carpet..the cabinets were horribly scratched. .. which only began to show, again, after the pre move in treatment wore off.
3. This is a big one. ... BUGS. When the weather began to heat up, they made their presence known. I know it's Vegas and bugs happen no matter how nice the area . but I HATE them.  *shudders* 
Pros:
1. They spray often and any time you need them to spray indoors, they're there. As well as maintenance. 
2. The area and the neighbors were nice. Very quiet. 
3. Nice, big pool area
4. Different layout. Nice, open space. And I love, LOVE all the windows! I think that was my favorite. I love all the natural light. I didn't have to use any lights til it got dark outside. And the location of my apartment added to all of that. Corner unit w mountain views. 
 5. The staff. From the women in the office to the maintenence guys..all nice and friendly. Esp Jill with perky her voice and attitude! 

I would live there again. .. in a unit w a balcony :-)

And to everyone bitching about being billed for damages.. Wow. You must've done some work to that place! I did not have that problem at all. But then again, I keep my clean and in tact ;-). I have been seeing Dr. Harari for about two years.  I have suffered with Hashimoto Thyroiditis for about 30 years, so I have seen many endocronologists.  Dr. Harari is hands down one of the best doctors I have ever worked with.  He is patient and kind and addressed all of my concerns. He takes the time to get to know you and he never makes you feel like he is in a rush to move on to the next patient.  He has never tried to sell me on additional medications or supplements. His only agenda is your good health.

He righted my ship after I suffered a lapse in judgment and sought help form a local naturopath. Poor judgment on my part employing a naturopath, but hey, at least I didn't go to a chiropractor, apparently they are experts in the area of thyroid disorders now, too.

I just can't say enough good things about Dr. Harari.  He is as good as they get! His wealth of knowledge, excellent bedside manner coupled with his patience and kindness make him an exceptional doctor that you can count on.. I always forget to review this place every time I go!  Especially since it's my favorite place to be!!!

The rooms here are always great cause they provide you with a lot of room!  6 people can be here and not get cramped!  2 people on each of the beds and they also have a pull out bed for another 2 people!

I love coming here because the staff is always friendly and also the hotel is in a great area!  Great area to walk since everything is around this hotel.  The shops and all the other great hotels if you like to go hotel hopping which is one of my favorite things to do since I don't gamble!  I just like to walk around and of course check out all the lobbies since they are always changing!

The staff here are so friendly that one time, we called them to have the room cleaned at a certain time, and later on that day, they called us asking to make sure that the service was done and if it wasn't to let them know right away!

Always a pleasure to be here!. Love this Freddie's location! Everyone is extremely nice & informative if help is needed. They have all of my favorite products ranging from BCAA's, zero calorie condiments, all the protein supplementation possible & my favorite peanut butters! Great prices at an easily accessible location, next to my gym. I wouldn't dare go anywhere else!. Last night my friends and I went to see Young Love at the Beauty Bar. I had never been there before, but I thought it was a good place to see live music. The decor is reminiscent of a kitschy 1950s hair salon. It is small inside the actual bar, but they have a little dance floor where there is a DJ spinning some really good music, and an area outside where you can listen to the live acts themselves.

The drinks were reasonable compared to the ones you get on the Strip ($20 for both of my friends including me, not including tip), and the staff were friendly. It was $10 for each of us to see the bands, which is reasonable as well. My only complaint was the sound system. They had a lot of technical problems, which kind of ruined the experience, since almost all the bands had a lot of starts and stops during their sets. If they could get that straightened out, I'd give it a full five stars. The merchandise was sold through a kiosk that looked like an old-fashioned trailer straight out of John Waters' Pink Flamingos, but it was a nice touch.

I liked the vibe and atmosphere of the place. It seemed like it's just a regular place for normal people to hang out and see bands who are "the next best thing" before they become big. Kind of quirky, unique, and different. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time and see some rockin' bands.. Letitcia was are server today and was a total delight! The line to get in was long but took Maybe 10 minutes total. The food is good and they have a pretty good selection. After a shopping trip down Rue St. Denis, my boyfriend and I decided to stop by this cute little chocolate boutique for a sweet treat...and boy, did we get one! 

We shared a mint hot chocolate (the waitress was kind enough to split it into two cups for us) and a chocolate fondue biscotti.  I know it sounds like chocolate overkill but it was SO good!! We were in a chocolate coma afterwards...

The next time we're in town I'd love to try some of their unique looking chocolates...

Only downer might be is that the prices are a bit steep but based on the couple of items we tried, the quality is definitely up there and probably worth it. :) 

I'd definitely recommend this place for anyone with a sweet tooth!. Bad ass. Yes, indeed I feel like a bad ass after my first full CrossFit class at Ultimate Crossfit. 

You see, I have a few friends who raaaaave about this CrossFit gym. And, I'll admit, I was a little intimidated when I first thought of trying out this seemingly bare bones gym. But, with a Yelp Kicks Butt promo and a little encouragement, I bought a ten class package and went for it. I've been through two fundamentals classes (to learn proper form, lingo and exercises) and one full on class. 

Let me tell you, it's a hell of a workout with awesome trainers. No, seriously, they're really great. They aren't drill sergeant esque, which I appreciate. They keep an eye on you, correct your form and offer encouragement. Score. Plus, they'll pump out some gansta rap in the background when requested. 

Every WOD (workout of the day) is different, so there's no chance you'll ever get bored. Run, squat, row, push ups, bench, ring dips, ball slams - it's like an awesome workout in a circus. Plus, they provide tons of online tools to track your progress. And the other CrossFitters? Really cool. The folks I've worked out with are super nice, friendly and helpful. If you want to get stronger with some great people and stellar trainers, try Ultimate CrossFit.. Wow! This food is delicious! I've eaten at plenty HI places in Vegas & this is by far the best. 

It's a family owned business, & it feels like eating at a friends house.

I had garlic chicken & spare ribs mixed plate. Ahhhmazzing (though pricy $15) it's so worth it if you don't mind spending the extra $4 in comparison to other HI places. Very filling & tasty. I'll be back soon!. Here to let Dex work her magic!. Julie does a fantastic job with cut and color! Will definitely return to her!. This is my favorite sushi place in Vegas! The food is priced well and they serve half rolls. Definitely try the Japanese Lasagna. I recommend this place to everyone.. Friendly owner touched each table and even brought out free desert samples. The portions were large, delicious, and inexpensive. Loved the dipping sauces.. Stiil in my not-so-humble opinon,the best bread in town. LOVED their bread before,love it now. Introduced my fussy supercook/baker/canner sister to the place when they were at their old location,and she's hooked too! Super bakery!. I have eaten at a MOD Pizza once before, on a trip to Seattle, so I was excited to try this location close to home. It lived up to expectations. The service was very nice and straightforward. My husband ordered a Mad Dog pizza with jalapenos added and some garlic strips. I had a completely custom salad that filled the bowl in a way that made it difficult for her to mix it.

I had just sat down with drinks when the pizza and sticks were done--they baked up that fast. My salad was delicious, and wow, what a deal for that price. I'm used to eating big salads but I actually had to ask for a container to take some home! My husband, who was visiting MOD for the first time, really liked his pizza. He said he'd be fine with eating there again.

When we entered the restaurant, there was no line, so we zoomed right through. The crowd followed us! It was nice to see the place so busy, as I know that location has had difficulty keeping restaurants. I really hope MOD makes it. This is a place I'd love to take my mom when she visits, as I know she will love their salads, too.. Love this studio! Super helpful, motivating and friendly staff. Such a great workout and great rates too!. Pretty good for takeout. The meat is more sound than usual Chinese take out. I love that this place has authentic Mexican & Latin meats for your taco. Very tasty & reasonable for your money.  Salsas are spot on.  I really enjoyed this place :-). One of the last indie stores standing, and I say BRAVO! Refusing to cave in to pressure from the chains, this store survives and its whip-smart staff really delivers. If they don't have it, they turn over every stone to find it -- fast. A pleasure to deal with.. Although I have been to NoDa several times in the past, today was my first time going to Smelly Cat. I had a great first experience there and definitely recommend stopping by if you're ever in the area! It's cozy, quirky and even has outdoor seating. 

They have awesome service, and everyone there was so friendly. My friend and I met all the workers on a first name basis and even met Cathy, the owner who is such a sweet lady by the way. They made me feel like I was a regular customer!

There were numerous drinks on the menu but not many pastry choices, which is why I did not give it five stars. By suggestion, I ordered an iced dirty chai in the biggest size they had. It usually comes with four shots of espresso, but I asked for one less shot. I thought it was delicious-- and this is coming from someone who is not so fond of the chai-taste!. This is our place. Stayed 3 nights (was supposed to be 4 but arrived late). It took sometime to get our room but the lady at the front did right by us.

We had a King Size, smoking room in Tower 1&2. The room was awful smelling but hey a lot of cigarettes have been smoked in it. It was clean, we had no issues with the drain in the shower. Our AC was so cool I would get up at night to turn it to a lower setting.

The bed was AMAZINGLY comfy. Firm with a pillow top, slept great! 

One if the things we liked the best.... easy to navigate the whole place. We were in and out several times a day because we were at a convention. Monorail right there, great food at Hash House a-go-go and Ginseng 3. Awesome entertainment with Divas.

After the renovation is complete I am sure it will only get better. We hope to return some time and see!. love love love the mixed plate #3!. Oh Le Reve, oh la la! 

Le Reve is the fabulous show at the Wynn Hotel and Casino.  It is a beautiful, breathtaking aquatic show.  The name Le Reve actually means The Dream in French, which plays nicely with its main theme and storyline.  The show is about you going into the the dreams of the main character and going on a fantastical adventure through the main character's subconscious mind.  And what an adventure it is!

This show was created by the mastermind Dragone.  He is the one that created O, Mystere, and Celine Dion's first Vegas show.  He used to be with Cirque but has since gone out on his own because the man is an artistic genius!  The man definitely knows what he is doing when it comes to dreaming up these amazing Vegas shows.  You ask how I know these things, well I used to be a concierge here in town and was lucky enough to attend several behind the scenes tours of this show, so I picked up some fun info right in the show itself.

I really don't want to say too much about the show because I don't want to ruin it for you, but it is just a beautiful show.  It does have some Cirque-style acrobatics in it, as well as a lot of other fun imagery.  It is my favorite water show in town and I think it kicks the other water show to the curb!  

The theater is a huge circle, so no matter where you are sitting, you have the same view as the person directly across from you.  There are no bad seats but there are wet seats, but those are just more fun, in my opinion.  The action takes place in a 360 degree stage, as well as going from beneath the water to the top of the theater.  No matter which direction you are looking, you will be watching something amazing going on.  The show has so many different scenes that you are always on the edge of your seat wondering what they are going to do next.  

Le Reve is simply beautiful, dark, mysterious, lovely, funny, and magnificent. all rolled up in one delightful package.  I think it is a must see show on the Vegas Strip for locals and visitors.. I really liked this place, but we were guests of my in-laws, and they got us the adjoining room, so note: we didn't have to sit through any time share sales pitch or had to even fend anyone off trying to sell us the timeshare. (BTW... we have one and wouldn't get another one anyways, I can't manage them all in my head and they give me a headache trying to!)

I digress... anyways, as far as this Bluegreen place is concerned, I was concerned at first about the lowflying aircraft seemingly overhead on the east side of the building, but upon arrival in to our room, didn't notice any aircraft noise at all. The limited interaction we had with the staff was pleasant, and I didn't feel like I was being sold anything. (And when we checked in, they knew we were guests) aka- fresh meat.

Liked that there were restaurants attached to the place- favorite- Einstein Bros. Bagels. Yum, busy place in the morning though! Note to self... they had awesome service there too. Friendly staff and great menu and deals.  ABC Store as well! Just like in the Islands.. Even smelled like the Islands. (Prob. that Plumeria perfume in it!)  Pizza place and a burger place too, didn't have time to go there though.

THe only downside I can say that I noticed first hand is that if you are adverse to walking, request a room not so far from the lobby. The elevator, seriously is like a HIKE to get to, and not near the main lobby at all. 

I did like that it's non-smoking and off the strip, and good parking that is near the lobby. (Remember my tip about the elevator though!). I love torrid!  I love the girls that work there, I love their clothes, I recommend it to my girlfriends, they really do have stylish plus size clothes, very youthful, because thats the problem at most stores that happen to have XL and XXL sizes, their variety sucks, you can never find a sexy plus size dress at the old navy!!!!! I wish they had more locations in the valley.. During a Bachelorette weekend, one of the girls in our party hooked our group into coming here for lunch to experience what she dubbed a "life changing burger." As the token vegan of the group, I was apprehensive on what I'd be able to eat.

Enter the Brussels Sprouts Salad!

Let's start by taking a look at it... http://bit.ly/1kN3ySz Pretty, right? Shaved brussels sprouts mixed with thinly sliced gala apples and pomegranate pearls. The Spicy Tangerine Vinaigrette had some kick to it. This usually comes with goat cheese but I think it's very tasty without it. Pretty filling too and totally perfect after a night of drinking.

As for the "life changing burger," I heard no complaints from our table.

Btw, the bread basket looked pretty amazing. It was filled with mini muffins and baked goods, both sweet and savory. While I didn't partake, the other ladies in the group were raving about it.. I'm so bragging about this place...  Absolutely amazing!!!  You were able to make this Fathers today extra special with your gluten free and sugar free delicious cupcake. My husband was in heaven.  Bought other "specialty" treats for my son and grandchildren. Everything was super delist. Special thank you to Ms. Lyrics for her assistance and expertise in making sure everything was exactly what I envisioned.. Easy place to find, we had a Living Social deal and went to use it last night.  Clean inside, don't let the depressing-looking strip mall setting deter you, because the food is GREAT.  We ordered the sub sandwiches to go, a Turkey and a BLT and they were delicious and worth the drive. We'll be back again.  Well-lit, clean inside, service was prompt and the food was amazing.. The cocktail list is delightful and full of fun concoctions and quality ingredients. Changes seasonally.

Highly recommend The Virginia Hill: Pisco, Lillet Blanc, peach syrup, fresh lemon juice, egg whites, and sage. Delicately smooth texture, herbal notes with a balanced flavor profile of fruit and citrus. And at $12 very reasonable for the amount of work the bartender had to put in to make it.

Will definitely be back!. Arrived here at around 6:30am..ish..and they're open 24/7.

Feet were dead! But, had to come here and get some grub after Drai's. Although I was exhausted out of my mind, the workers kept me laughing. 

For being so early in the morning, they all had so much energy! All young cats too. All happy, joking with each other, being silly..I loved it!

It brings a great atmosphere to the place. 

Ordered me a medium with cheese..bf got the XXL with cheese and bacon. Also got a side of onion rangs..mm :] 

Asked for ranch, and they gave us the Hidden Valley. BEST RANCH EVERRR! 

Onion rings=amazing.

Burger=Delicious.. They have remodeled this Fry's and I am pretty pleased with the outcome. This is still good value for your money, better so than Safeway or Bashas in my opinion.

Don't get me wrong I do enjoy Winco and go there for a lot of the major bulk items I need, however when I need the basics I can always find what I am looking for at Fry's.

I appreciate the customer service they have here, not overly pushy but when I need something like a custom butcher cut, rain check, or deli order they are very attentive.. I am so glad that I found Sandra! She is super friendly, professional, and does a great job. I've gone to her for waxing but she also does facials and other skin treatments. I just haven't tried those out yet!

Waxing can be an awkward experience, but she makes it comfortable by chatting with you and it honestly feels more like I am catching up with a friend during my appointments. The place itself is also really nicely decorated compared to other waxing places that I have been.

Sandra is easy to communicate with through text and setting up appointments is a breeze.

I definitely recommend Sandra!. Awesome selection of beer and food is good and consistent. Not what I would call a cozy restaurant, but service is still good. Good fish n chips to go with the beer.. I can not believe how great of a job Austin did! He was on time, quick and by the time he was done, you couldn't tell I had two toddlers that routinely ride in my car! Highly recommend!. "Jo" was a great server!  Convinced one in our party to get the grilled fries NOT the french fries, and the spuds didn't disappoint! The New York steak sandwich was scrumptious!. this has always been my favorite coffee shop in phoenix.  the organic lattes are the fuel that powers me through this crazy world!

i love the ambiance, the people, the food, the art, the music, the couches and of course the coffee. (these guys roast their own beans incase you didn't know)

i have not had the privilege of dining here yet, but i'm sure it is a wonderful experience like everything else.  jeff has done an amazing job breathing life into the new location.

i truly feel the heart of my community every time i am at lux.. My husband and I love love this place. 
If you are looking for a scene and need to be seen this is not your joint. I've been coming here since I was a little girl and it's always been great. 
As for the comments about the service being poor or cold I couldn't disagree more. It might be a bit more like service on the East Coast, efficient and no nonsense, but for how busy they always are that's expected. The food is amazing. Always. 

I love the French Crepes. Perfect Crepes with fresh sliced strawberries inside and on top, yummy strawberry syrup and fresh whipping cream!!! With a side of crispy bacon. Amazing meal. 
My husband loves the breakfast burrito. It's HUGE. Filled with tons of  goodies- egg, ect and has a green tomatillo sauce on top and melted cheese. It's his favorite breakfast. 

Enjoy!!. Delicious food and great service. We will return for sure. Reasonable prices for high quality food.. XS would have been perfect in my book if they played better music. I love house but when I want to go out with my friends and dance the heck out of the night, house usually isn't my choice of poison. 

XS is absolutely gorgeous and ginormous! There is a huge dance floor in the center, which is the only main dance floor so it does get kinda packed. Surrounding it is the bar and tables for people. Large dance floor leads to the outdoor patio that leads to the pool and more bars. Basically just the fabulous place you want to be at but it's not too packed that you feel like a sardine in a can!. We loved this ranch! The views were breathtaking, our guide was so knowledgeable about the dessert, plants and history of the area. He took his time until we got comfortable with the horses. He even jumped off his horse Tonto (love the name) and took some pictures of us. We took the 2 hour ride and it was very peaceful and just a wonderful time. Cant wait to go back!. I've heard about this place for a while..decided to check it out..very good and a nice variety of different Asian foods..we had the hot and sour soup, shrimp curry and the mixed bag of a little of everything..very good and big portions..plenty of leftovers.  If you're in the mood for Peking duck you need to order it a day in advance and the yelp discount for check ins doesn't work anymore.. The interior is like a sports bar, except they specialize in wings with a million different favors!!!
We've got a really good deal as well: ended up paying  less than 50 cents per wing!
Last but not least, did I mention all the waitresses there are super cute and/or hot blonde girls?
I heart this this place!. I think I'd heard too much about BabyStacks before visiting, so my expectations were WAY too high! However, that's not to say that it was a bad experience by any stretch. I just should have stuck to my initial thought and either ordered the Red Velvet or Carrot Cake pancakes instead of the Cinnamon Roll. They were good, just not great. It took awhile to get to the cinnamon- for awhile I felt like they were just regular pancakes.

The service was friendly, and coffee was refilled frequently. They do very brisk business, so you'll likely have a wait if you visit on a weekend. Prices were very fair- 2 people can eat well for $20.. Shoutout to SOUTHWEST for making my birthday super sweet. They comped my drinks on the plane, gave me a birthday shoutout, and had all the passengers turn on their above head lights, so I could "BLOW OUT THE CANDLES" when everyone sang Happy Birthday. This was my first flight with Southwest and it won't be my last. Went in for dinner and it was delish and service was great.  Beers were cold too!
Ordered honey BBQ and medium wings for an app.  Wings are very meaty, flavorful and taste fresh.
Dinner was a 14" pepperoni and sausage pizza.  Cooked perfect and hot out of the oven.  Our server was Tammy and she was great.  
Can't wait to go back!. No kidding, there are NO REVIEWS to speak of for this store? It is the nicest bead store I have ever been in. The staff are overly helpful and attentive. They will go to great lengths to get you what you need. I can't tell you how much I love the inlaid components. They have over the top beautiful clasps. Things I could never find in Omaha. I am stoked that I got so many pretty things.. I live for the bread and dipping oil. Very nice place. Would be excellent for a date night. Good ambience and delicious food.. My husband took me here for our 20th anniversary and it was amazing. The meats where perfectly cooked, the salad bar was fresh and amazing. Servers very attentive. My Brazilian drink was the bomb. I know most would have flipped when the $225.00 bill arrived, but it was worth it and a special occasion. We go to Rioz every time we are in Myrtle Beach and while it is always good, Chima's salad bar was much better. If you have the funds please give it a try.. Never been disappointed in the Egg & I on Sahara in Vegas.  Chance took really good care of us.. Finally had the chance to try Luna's tonight and it was fantastic. I would highly recommend this place, although you need to know what you are getting yourself into. If you enjoy fresh fruits/vegetables and are open to trying new flavors/textures.. this is a great dining experience!
I had the pad thai (a large portion) and was surprised at their twist on the classic dish since the 'noodles' were actually zucchini, carrots and other sliced vegetables. My only criticism was that the dish was not spicy as our waitress had described. The side portion of the waldorf salad was amazing.
I will definitely be returning!!. I'll make this short and sweet...
Fabulous and I mean fabulous decor and themed hotel. It was mystical and magical, glamour and chic!  Everything from the driving up to the entrance to the room was impeccable! The view from all angles were breath taking from morning to night! To see the city lights and the mountains off in the horizon was definitely something we Boston city girls admired and appreciated. We stayed here for a couple of nights because we were attending the TIGI World Release Show in the convention center. The hotel is HUGE ! They have a high end designer shopping plaza attached to so if you love the fine sparkly things you should definitely go even if it's to walk through and admire all the fashion. The location of the hotel is in a pretty good location it's right on the strip close to a cvs so it's convenient. The room was really clean it was beautiful the bathroom was the best feature along with the view the mirror was huge lighting was on point and the shower was refreshing. The beds and pillows were super comfy and cozy. They have a safe invade you need to lock up valuables. Say good bye to those old do not disturb signs they have a nice privacy button to let room service know not to come in. Overall we love the experience here we would definitely come back if you creative and imaginative you should definitely stop in !. Love this location because it is so close to my work. We stop by almost daily for a tea and perhaps a sandwhich or some amazing dessert! The ladies in the bakery are always so nice and now know us because we go there so much! So thankful for my refillable AJ's cup that their fabulous corporate office helped me track down. Love this place!. This is my favorite restaurant at Westgate and it makes me reluctant to try other places--the food is good and reliable (I just know never to come here before a Coyotes game because of the crowds). My son is autistic and an extremely picky eater; he'll only eat tortilla chips in restaurants. Yard House offers good chips and is always willing to serve the toppings on the side. That's greatly appreciated.

I love their ahi crunchy salad and I've had several of their flatbreads, too. I like that they have the nutrition information online. It makes it easy for me to choose foods that are healthy and yet still an indulgence!

I recently took my parents and brother here while they were on a visit.  My brother raved about the (Mac + Cheese)2, and he's pretty difficult to please with food. My Mom enjoyed her roasted turkey cobb salad. My dad had a cheeseburger and liked it, though the fries were thin for his preference. Can't please everyone!

When my husband is able to come along, he loves Yard House for their beer selection, too. I've had cocktails here in the past and enjoyed them.. I am really starting to love Sprouts.  It is one of the only stores that I have found in the area that has bulk spices, plus it has a large bulk goods section.  And their prices on produce are amazing!  Especially if you buy the sale items.  I can't believe some of the deals I have gotten here.  That being said, I mostly stick with bulk items and produce.  Their packaged foods tend to be a little more expensive - unless you can get some of their store brand items.  I also think that their customer service could be improved.  It isn't bad, but I often feel like I am being flat out ignored by the staff.  In fact yesterday I was nearly run over by a guy pushing a produce cart!  But I still think it is one of the best grocery stores in the area.. The meatballs and sauce taste just like my family recipe! So good! Great place to relax, have an ice cold beer, eat some great food, and bring the family!. The service was superb. The food was ok. I think I was expecting a different type of Spanish fare. For example, I love grilled octopus. Squid, however, is very chewy. They served squid, and it was like chewing a bland rubber band. I swallowed it out of politeness but didn't eat another bite. A few plates were akin to that experience. However, the meal was interactive, the setting intimate, the service outstanding. A few dishes were exceptional. My fiancée didn't really enjoy the meal either, but the rest of the group seemed to like the dishes we didn't so for that reason, my rating remains high even though the dishes weren't to my liking personally.. I love shopping in bulk, especially when produce comes in such large quantity!  After a year of shopping here the selection is finally getting more varied and is catching up to Costco in terms of quality.  

One thing they do beat other warehouse stores in is the concession stand.  When they have things in it is super tasty and super cheap, and the tea machine is my favorite thing in the store.. Though I don't mind Starbucks, I will never go back. Sunsational Coffee not only does it right, they get to know you in the process. I have started ordering decaf drinks lately due to my anxiety levels and Lloyd (the owner) every time reminds me, knowing I am prone to forget my new commitment.

Anyway, as a coffee-lover from Seattle, the city of caffeine, Sunsational really makes me miss home, and is the perfect solution for my fix. Lloyd is from Washington state himself, and takes great care over your beverage, so if you aren't satisfied, he'll be sure to get it just right for you! (And remember your drink the next time too most likely.). Best Thai food in the west valley!  Nice variety of dishes.  The service is wonderful.  Very attentive and helpful.  I am always amazed at how fast the food is prepared and served.  I think the portion size is perfect for the lunch specials-I am full, but not tempted to be a glutton because it's too good to stop eating.  The prices are excellent.  The food is flavorful and fresh, and they can make it spicy like I like it and mild for my friends.  I are there for lunch and find myself wishing I could go back for dinner.  You have to try it..so good!. I loved the desserts here and would definitely go back for more! I had a peanut butter crumb cake sort of dessert with a green tea bun and a sugar twisted doughnut.  It's comparable to the Asian bakeries that Philadelphia has - maybe a bit pricier, but well worth the money! 

I love the interior and the cashier was really nice in explaining what was what. 

The pastries were perfectly fluffy but as usual pastries aren't very filling so it's easy to just scarf down 10 of them. Which I will.. Yummy great place to take a break from the heat.. Located in the Venetian's Venezia Hall, Bouchon is a great restaurant tucked away from the glitz and cheesiness of the strip with amazing food. 

We sat on the patio which overlooked the pool area. The patio had a nice cozy atmosphere and seemed quieter than inside (which was noisy from all the bustling). The epi bread is freshly baked and their butter is amazing. The butter tasted to so fresh and light that I wanted to eat it plain.


We ordered a few cocktails, the moscow mule and I can't remember the second (wasn't that good). The moscow mule is a must have! Gingery and fresh, I could have had my bf's whole mug - and yes, the drink is really served in a mug. So cute!

We started with the pork belly special served with barley and sauteed veggies. Holy moly. The pork belly was soooo melt-in-your-mouth tender and tasty. The veggies were cooked perfectly (loved the brussell sprouts) and the barley added a nice texture contrast to the dish. We also had a mixed greens salad with goat cheese which was nothing special, not good, not bad.

The bf had the croque madame. Crap that thing was so buttery and creamy, it was like a pillow of heaven. The egg was perfectly cooked, the bechamel was killer and not oily, and the brioche was so buttery that I wanted to take it home with me. The croque madame was served with fries and they were skinny and crispy, but a bit too salty. I ordered the flat iron steak with spinach and garlic. The steak was so tender; I couldn't believe a flat iron steak could be so tender! The spinach and garlic were drenched in oil/butter so I didn't care for it much.

For dessert, we had the BOuchons, which were brownies and ice cream. Nothing special. I wish they had better dessert!!!

Great dining experience, casual and elegant setting, good service, and deelish food. Now if only they could fine tune their food skills and offer better desserts. Not on your way to Vegas? Not to worry, Bouchon is coming to Beverly Hills next month!. Sympathique restaurant où je suis récemment allée pour le brunch. Service courtois et ambiance chaleureuse.

Les prix sont moyennement élevés et la nourriture est de qualité. Des mangues et des ananas frais dans la salade de fruits au lieu des usuels raisins rouges et morceaux de cantaloup défraîchie, qui dit mieux! ;)

Excellent fromage blanc à tartiner sur le pain baguette. 

J'y retournerai!

Pour le brunch, je suggère d'y aller dès l'ouverture (10h), car le restaurant se remplit assez rapidement.. Brian did a great job at a fair price. He was very accommodating & conscientious. Would def recommend.. I never thought that I'd be giving Steak 'n Shake a 4 star review, but I really enjoyed my dinner here tonight. It just hit the spot!

I was impressed by our waiter as soon as we walked through the door. He apologized for our very brief wait to be seated and for the fact that he was the only waiter working at that time. However, everything was delivered promptly, and he made what would've been just a tasty diner dinner into a great experience.

I ordered a grilled cheese and fries. The grilled cheese was well cooked and filled with tasty, perfectly melty cheese. I love Steak 'n Shake's thin and crispy fries, and these were as delicious as I had expected.

For just $9 for me and my husband, I have to admit that we had forgotten how inexpensive Steak 'n Shake was. Based on the cost, the food, and our fantastic waiter, we'll be back soon.. It's new, it's hip, it's hot, it's happenin'...  Lot's of great looking people.  Just go!!!. I had a great experience at this Salon.  Rosa gave me great service.  I have very long hair and she took the time needed to give me a whole head of highlights in two shades plus a haircut with no complaints.  She is a great hairstylist.  Very friendly.  Would recommend this salon to anyone who asks me where I went to get my hair done.  Will be back for future hair care.  The manager was also very friendly.  Liked everyone that helped me there on Saturday 6/6/15.

Pamela Golyer. My husband and I are new to the area, and decided this looked like a great place to celebrate my birthday. It was an excellent decision. As other people have mentioned, being located in a historic Charlotte home really sets it apart. It's beautiful, but not snobby. The wine list is incredible, the service was wonderful and the food... butterscotch creme brûlée. That's all I need to say. Holy moly. Amazing. If you can afford to eat at a place like that several times a year, go for it. But for the rest of us, it's the kind of place that you'll want to save for a special occasion. Be ready to sit and enjoy your food and wine. We spent a couple of hours there and I'd love to go back again sometime!. Awesome new place! Fresh sushi and a great menu! We had all you can eat and a bottle of wine. Took our time and tried a bunch of items. Everything was tasty and super fresh! Will definitely be coming back as a regular.. When we first moved to Las Vegas, we worried about finding an auto shop which would service our cars without us finding oil spilled all over, grease on our seats or problems with the service! We found Chris and USA Auto just when they first opened and we are still coming back! Marlene is as good as it gets with customers and service. Chris makes sure everything is done right! Thank you for keeping the same high level of service the same as we had the first time! Also for keeping your prices so affordable.. 5 $ veggie Tahli was the best . It actually had flavor!  I could taste the coriander in the fresh Dahl!  The naan (gave me an additional serving) was included in the price. The staff was friendly. This is a good place to bring a friend for a first time introduction in not too spicy Indian cuisine.. I've been wanting to try The Original Chopshop for a while now & finally got around to going for dinner! I had heard from many friends that the protein bowls are delicious so I went with the Teriyaki Chicken Protein Bowl and my date got the Thai Chicken Protein Bowl.

The Teriyaki bowl had a nice sautéed blend of chicken in teriyaki sauce and roasted vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, onions, carrots, mushrooms, & brussles sprouts) which was topped with avocado & toasted sesame seeds. Between brown rice, forbidden rice, and sweet potato hash, I had selected the sweet potato hash; it complimented the rest of the flavors well.

I didn't particularly care for the Thai Chicken bowl but my date really enjoyed it. This bowl had chicken in a thai curry sauce with veggies (as previously mentioned minus the mushrooms & brussles sprouts). My date got it with the sweet potato hash as well.

Looks were very deceiving because the bowl filled us up quickly & we weren't hungry for hours after eating it. I'd say that the price is justifiable for what you get. Additionally, the location is perfect - right in Downtown Chandler & there was plenty of seating available for small & large groups. We'll be back!. The Griffin rocks. Literally. It has a killer jukebox. And lots of stone work.

This place is really the antithesis of the Strip. It's downtown, steps from the Fremont Street Experience, but has more of a locals vibe to it. Actually, it seems like a place you'd find in Hollywood or Los Feliz...which makes sense since, according to their matchbooks, there's a Griffin there, as well.

The Griffin stays true to its name with a whole gothic decor thing going on -- roaring fireplaces, leather seats, etc. There's a back room with a DJ, but why would you hang there with such a great jukebox in front?! In any given hour you could hear The Kinks, The Jam, The Who, Echo and the Bunnymen, Hard-Fi...and I'm only scratching the surface. Great selection.

My only complaint about this place: Nobody told me I had to have an iPhone to fit in. Seriously. Everybody had one but me. Poor me. Sigh. Another Stella, please!. So happy to have accidentally found this place! Hamachi X Hamachi roll is so delicious, and I may actually punch a stranger for the Volcano roll... oh cherry blossom roll they are all amazing!! 
I get my food to go from here since I usually go on my lunch break from work. They are all SO friendly welcome me everytime I come in and say goodbye whole heartedly. The woman whom answers the phone knows my name now... obviously I have a sushi problem.. hey it could be worse

I highly advise you to go here. Went here after finding out that the palazzo one was closed for the night. The burger is HUGE!!! Pretty yummy too after a night of dancing!. Thanks to the Venetian for forever making every other hotel I will ever stay at, look like a cruddy, rat-infested pigstie. 

True, I've never been to any of the other fancy hotels, like Geoff D. mentioned (the Mandalay, Mirage, MGM), so I have no basis for comparison, and I have to admit that if I'd actually had to pay for it, I might have been tempted to take off a star or two, but luckily I got to stay there as a guest. The Venetian literally makes me suck my breath in. I almost gave it 4 stars (taking off a star for the fact that you need a GPS to navigate your way around) but... I just can't do it. Aaaaaagh. 

The Venetian Hotel is a lot like Gavin Newsom, for 5 reasons (I'd give Mayor G 4 stars but since I got to stay at the Venetian for free I feel like I should give them a higher rating).

1. It's ridiculously nice despite its shortcomings (there was a staff member at every other corner making sure you didn't get lost). 

2. It's not afraid to take chances. Mayor Gavin will forever be dear in my heart for standing up for gay rights, despite what it looked like to the Republicans... during election time... ok lets not go there. But I still love you Newsom. Likewise, who'd have thought painting bright fluffy white clouds over a blue sky on the shopping mall ceiling would work?! But It's awesome.

3. Yeah, it's a little messed up and can cause a state of confusion (and not just the should-I-cheat-on-my-husband / Ruby Tourk type). I am very bad with directions and got totally lost trying to find my way around (Wait...  you mean... uh... go up to the tenth floor to get to the first floor? Whaaaa?). I heard 3 people say "I feel like I'm stuck in a MAZE!" 

4. No matter how many times I see it, it still makes me think, Ho-ly Jesus how did God come up with something so pretty to look at (and dudes, do not EVEN try to say you wouldn't think the same if Cindy Crawford was mayor). I LOVE the design and layout of the rooms. The colors, everything. The draperies were gorgeous, and it's great to feel like you're in a parlor, going down a step or two to the next level where the TV (SECOND set) is.  Huge fluffy bathrobe in the closet. Fine toiletries. But the very best thing for me is the shower. It's a bit like standing in front of a fire hydrant and getting blasted with hot water. Totally awesome. This place doesn't leave details to chance.

And lastly,

5.  Loooord only knows what kind of down and dirty stuff is going on behind those closed, fancy white doors. 

Geoff D. had a good point, if you only spend a few hours a night there, $350 is a big wad to drop (what is that, almost 90 bucks an hour?). But if you're allergic to crowds like I am, it's not a bad place to hole up in.. cheap, fast, super friendly. Great place!. Authentic old school saloon. I liked it a lot here. Its a very small bar, but Its got stools, and whiskey at a fair price- thats all I need! Its right in Old Town & when I went, there was more of an older-tourist crowd as opposed to the college young'ins. I swear I also saw the worlds oldest cowboy here- had to be 142 years old. 
So if your in a Cowboy chasin--whiskey drinkin kind of mood- check this place out.. I have been looking for a lady Barber....and FINALLY found a great one. Not to say she only does short hair...she is great with all cuts!!! LeeAnn at Village Clipper Barber & Style in Belmont! Nicest lady, very personable. And really knows what she is doing...both my husband and myself are very happy with our cuts!!!. My GO-TO nail salon. I recommend it to everyone and anyone! I am from the Bay Area, so when I moved to AZ, finding a nail salon that I could count on to be clean and do my nails exactly how I like them was difficult, to say the least. My friend brought me to Karen (the owner) at Delightful Nails, and it was the best experience. I am now a regular at Delightful Nails, and I will never look back. 

Okay, first things first, I am extremely picky about how my nails are done. I am never excited to spend $$ just to maintain my nails, but when I do spend the money on it, I want it to be perfect and to last! So I was relieved when my friend introduced me to Delightful Nails because it is always on point.  I've had Kim, Karen, Vu, and Minh all work on my manicures and they are all fantastic. I am never particular about my pedicures, but if Minh is available I always ask for him. My pedi's last for a long time when he does it. 

Karen also does my eyebrows ( I will never let anyone else touch my eyebrows ever again!) She is the best waxer I've ever had. I've never found a waxer that I've loved as much as Karen.. Had Truknyaki at the Sunset Park food truck event.
Amazing food.
Cooked to order. I guess they are pretty popular, the line was long and due to the fact it is prepared to order there was a wait for food. Worth the wait. Their custom sauce was to die for. I have never had food of this quality from a food truck.. After the enthusiastic recommendation of some foodie friends, we decided to try Otto Enoteca for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  Although the restaurant seemed full, we were promptly seated at a table that afforded a view of the square (i.e. I watched a "statue" throughout our entire meal).

Our waiter was enthusiastic and I must note, pronounced the Italian perfectly (although he clearly wasn't Italian).  He guided us through the menu and since we weren't that hungry (and had dinner reservations for Bouchon), we decided on an appetizer and a pasta dish to share.  We got the gnocco frito, and per the waiter's suggestion, had prosciutto wrapped around it.  HEAVENLY!  I've never had anything like it:  it was almost like a savory funnel cake with salty prosciutto and finely grated fresh parmesan.  Omg, yum yum yum.  The portion was huge too - definitely a share-able appetizer!  We then got the spaghetti and meatballs, which is my favorite dish and I'm always on the search for the best meatball ever.  Were these it?  No, but I loved the spicy-ness of the dish and the freshness of the basil really paired well with the pasta.

One of my favorite things about Otto Enoteca was the wine.  Otto has an enomatic wine dispenser, which permits you to get small to large glasses of wine, based on what you like.  This means that your gamble on wine is actually quite diminished; something interesting for Vegas where gambling is so prevalent!  I took advantage of and got a small glass of the Brunello.  The bottle retailed for $220, but my small glass was just $17.50.  A coup, if you ask me, to sample a super rare vintage of one of my favorite wines.  Yay.

Hubby went the amari route and the manager gave us a very personalized walk through of the numerous selections, pointing out the specific ones beloved by Mario.  So special!  The manager seriously spent about 20 minutes just with us walking through all the various types, before we settled on 4 different ones to taste and savor.  And yes, artichoke liquer is actually tasty!

All in all, impeccable service, unique italian eats, and a great people-watching spot make this one a fun afternoon spot.  I would definitely go again and try the pizza, which looked amazing!  

But note:  Is it the best Italian you will ever have?  Nah, so I'm not sure I'd recommend this as a prime time dinner spot (especially with the price tag), but I did really enjoy it!

One weird thing worth noting:  we ordered soda water, but it wasn't until the end of the meal that I realized it was being poured from a fancy bottle instead of simply served from behind the bar.  And then the bill came:  $7/bottle.  Oooooooops.. We shopped around before choosing JPG and we're so glad we did! Jim and Toby came out to do the installation and are top notch guys. We love the system they put in and all the options it comes with, especially the mobile app (which, by the way, they showed us how to use before leaving which was definitely above & beyond)! You can't beat their new systems and FREE install - same price as the competitors who really can't compare as far as systems go. These guys are definitely Woohoo!. I eat breakfast here every time I am in town. I love the baked pancakes. I have never found them anywhere else and they are delicious. They take awhile to prepare but they are worth the wait and you know they are always fresh.. It gives me great pleasure to write this review.  If I could give Lisa Etchells of West USA Realty a rating higher than 5 stars, I happily would!  Lisa recently assisted us in purchasing our dream home.  Immediately upon taking us on as clients and listening to what we were looking for in a home, Lisa set up a MLS search.  The search allowed us to receive emails and view all homes that fell within the parameters that we had established.   This was particularly important for us, as we were out-of-state buyers.  Through this method, we could view homes and comment to Lisa about what we liked, or didn't like about each one.  Lisa reviewed this feedback critically so that she had a good read on what we liked, and could further aggregate the available hones.  This was especially important since our time to view homes was limited to one short weekend.  Lisa tirelessly scheduled home tours for us.  While we would view the homes together, Lisa recorded all the comments she heard us say so that she could help us remember and differentiate between the many homes we viewed, and narrow down our choices.  Once we had made our selection, she quickly contacted and negotiated the sale with the other realtor and sellers, keeping our suspense to a minimum, thankfully! She supported us through the (sometimes harrowing) mortgage process with Quicken Loans, and was genuinely happy for us when the loan finally closed.  Lisa is a patient, responsible and caring real estate agent who communicates well and stays in frequent contact throughout the entire home purchase process.  I am happy to wholeheartedly recommend her to my fellow Yelpers, family and friends.. Gosh, if I lived in Montreal I would be here nearly every night. The falafel is so delicious, and it's plenty of food. The veggie plate comes with eggplant, cabbage, one piece of falafel, chickpeas, served over a bed of rice (which is so deliciously dressed!) definitely a must visit for late night food in Montreal. Not to mention the guys working there are all so friendly!. This place (and Frankie's)  is the reason I'm so pale in the summer. 
Yelpers- Champagne's is straight up historic and a must stop after traveling from McCarran or after braving Boulevard Mall. 

I think the cocktails are $5 but who knows, and who cares! You're at Champagne's!

Karaoke happens and these people put soul behind their songs. One time Louis Armstrong manifested after a rendition of Hello Dolly!. ​

But seriously, Champagne's cannot be reviewed. Champagne's means something different to everyone.. They expanded the mall since I was there three years ago.  It is so fab now with more designer stores.  Name a designer, they will have it. I just wish I had more time to shop there!. This CVS is in a good location on the Strip next to Monte Carlo. Cheaper option for buying any meds, bottled water, snacks than inside the casinos. 

This location had more food than most CVS'. Sandwiches and a large refrigerated section. Also a large section of inexpensive Vegas souvenirs. 

Many cashiers at this location. Good thing since this place always crowded no matter what time of day.. I love this place! Amy Horn is amazing.  My hair is the perfect color! Everyone is so nice! Highly recommend!  Thanks Amy Horn!. It's been a while, so I'm going to update. 

So... I've been going here since 2004... on average, at least 3 times a month.  I swear that when I win the lottery, I am stealing Kelvin and Jennifer from all of you so they can be my personal chefs.  Sorry ya'll. :-)

The food quality hasn't changed (which is absolutely THE BEST... and I've tried a lot of sushi places to compare it to)... Kelvin and Jennifer haven't changed... they have a massive TV to check out either an Iron Chef competition or the local ballgame.

They are now open ALL DAY.  YAY!!!!

What's cool is that recently they updated their happy hour special... special priced rolls from 11:00am to 2:30pm every single day... and they have a special where you can get a large beer and a small sake for $5!  NICE.  Bring that on.  I mentioned that to a friend recently... and he said, "That's a great deal... and a whole lotta trouble!"

If there's anywhere where I want to get in trouble... it's at Tokyo Lobby. 

They are my sushi family. :-). I REALLY liked the French Toast, and I am a French Toast connoisseur. It is dipped in a Banana and cream sauce before heading to the griddle.  Soooooo Yummilicious!!!!!!!!

My husband ordered a mountain. Or at least that's what it looked like when it came out, Chicken Benedict.  It was mashed potatoes on the bottom, spinach, biscuits, chicken, and then some amazing sauce on top. Who knows what else was in there. He liked it, but he didn't finish it... he cried "Uncle".   I would come back here if I'm craving French Toast!. What a wonderful place Craig runs! So happy we chose to stay at The Parsonage for a girls weekend to Madison.

The highlights:
- Location: While the B&B is about 25 minutes from downtown Madison, it's very easy to get to. The perk of being off the beaten path is, well, being off the beaten path. 
- Price: The three of us chose the top floor Reverend's Retreat, which can actually sleep up to 6. It had the feel of your parent's attic, but in a good, comfortable way. For the Friday & Saturday night, it was about comparable to what we would've paid to stay at a fancy-pants place in Madison.
- Food: Oh my goodness, can Craig cook! The breakfasts alone would've been worth $20/person at a restaurant. Definitely try the juice blend - you won't look at orange and cranberry juice the same way again. 
- The company: On the weekend we were there, we (late 20s/early 30s) had the pleasure of staying with younger groups of people. Chatting at the communal breakfast table was a nice perk and a great way to get some new tips on what to see & do in Madison. And, Craig and his wife have two lovely dogs. 

If you're in town, definitely look up & consider The Parsonage.. Hot dogs!  Toppings are really good, the staff is friendly.  Maybe not the best choice if you don't like hot dogs but they have plain options for picky eaters.  

I had the Banh Mi dog and Angry Kimchi fries (the order was big enough to share between 3 hungry adults).  It was sooooo good, I had a hard time restraining myself from ordering another one!. Love that place! Génial!!!! La nourriture est parfaite pour une dégustation de bière. Je recommande de prendre le plateau de 4 petits verres de dégustation pour savourer la variété offerte.. I've heard about this place and finally decided to head over here for a date night with my boyfriend. Its a very modern style and I love the wrap around counter. The servers are very accommodating to First timers! I was a little apprehensive as this was my first time experiencing shabu shabu dining. My boyfriend and I had the beef wagyu and the pork with the sweet broth... It was amazing!!! For dessert we had the chocolate and strawberries. Also when you are finished with the meat and rice you can pour the broth into a bowl with the noodles and left over veggies! My overall experience was great! I would definitely come back again!. We went here for lunch very late in the day. They were getting ready to close, but seated us and were still gracious. Our waitress was very professional and helpful. I ordered the steak cobb as usual. I should try something else but it is so good I can't help myself. My friend had the caesar and said it was good, but wished she had ordered what I did. We couldn't drink as we still had appointments. But they have the best Sangria and Mimosas I have ever had. Even though we were well past closing she did not try to rush us out. I adore this place and can't wait to return!. This place is awesome and the environment is so much fun! The instructor is so nice and they just make it really enjoyable. I did not think this would be my thing when I first went but now I cannot wait to go back.

I love the fact that they already have it presketched. This makes it even more fun because the bones of the painting are already there. During the painting the instructor goes around the room and will give you pointers or help with questions you may have.

The studio is so much fun, it is decorated and set up great! For a small room, it comfortably fits a lot of painters. There is also enough room for your BYOB wine!!

The end result is that each person's painting turns out beautiful and a unique masterpiece! Non artistic do not fear, you can't have a bad painting.. If you have a pet, you should be at the Noble Beast.

My poor dog has been suffering from severe allergies for years and nothing seemed to work. We spent thousands on test, treatments and yuppy dog food trying to just help the poor thing from chewing herself to death. On my last glimmer of hope I stopped by the Noble Beast and felt an instant sigh of relief. This (kind of cute) guy with a pony tail was more than happy  to help me and starting giving me options within minutes. He took a good look at my dogs allergy report and explained why she should or shouldn't eat certain things. I ended up buying a Venison and Sweet Potato food for my dog and within in 2 weeks the redness cleared up and the chewing stopped by 50%. I couldn't believe it.
I have been a faithful customer since!. I am a new home owner in Las Vegas and This is the first and only restoration company I will use. the service was exceptional. 
First off, they actually answered the phone, and we're very polite and secondly I was able to make an appointment for the next day and they were on time. That's the kinda attention a customer wants to receive. 
And the best part was the work was completed faster than expected and the estimate was right on!!. I wasn't sure about this place but have been looking for a spot close to us.  I decided to give them a try and am so glad that I did! 
They were very fast and did a fantastic job.  I had David and will definitely go again!. I love this place! It's a tiny hole in the wall and a real treasure to N.D.G. The soft tacos are super yummy and huge! Only order one unless you're really hungry because you'll only get half way through taco #2. Try the pork or the fish, you'll be really happy. They also have a great variety of Mexican soft drink! The only thing I think could be improved is the amount of cilantro that is put on top of the tacos, it's a little excessive.  Other than that, top notch!!!. Wow what a fabulous meal, made even better by the brilliant service!!! Just ate here and can't believe I haven't been here before. My boyfriend had the set meal which he loved (absolute bargain) and I had the cheese plate. The waiter was so helpful and knowledgable and couldn't do enough for us. He was constantly offering us more food for free to make sure we enjoyed our meals properly. The strip is so packed and everywhere was rammed so it was a pleasure to come here for a bit of a chilled atmosphere. You have to go here like now!!!. I came here with 3 others during their busy time on Saturday morning (around noon), we had an hour wait, but I really wanted to try this restaurant so the rest of the party sucked it up and waited with me.

We decided to order some drinks - their Bloody Mary is pretty good, the sweet pickles are delicious. I ordered a frozen screwdriver while we were eating - it tasted like an orange dreamsicle but was a bit too much sweetness for me to finish.

The wait seemed to last forever, but they allow you to sit out in a lobby area which is nice because then you aren't crammed by the bar.

Me and one other ordered the Spring Break Diet, over easy eggs on mine. It was delicious! Served with corn tortillas really made it hit the spot. One other in our group ordered the Eggs Benedict - now this is something I would get if we come back again! The last person in the group ordered the double chocolate pancakes.. I mean these were pure chocolate, like a big 'ol brownie. He is a pancake and sweets lover and he said they were the best cakes he has ever had. Ordered some donuts to try later on and we also enjoyed those. They had good consistency and were just the right amount of sweet.

Overall delicious but recommend coming during their slower hours!. This place is amazing my nails are always perfectly shaped and they do them in a good time frame. This was my second time here and they still amazed me with how nice they are and how well my nails turned out! Jonny has done my nails the last two times and I think I now have found my nail tech !! Best place I have been to in Vegas by far !?. La Comida was highly recommended by friends who know Las Vegas well. It was every bit as good as they promised. 
We had a very good lunch at La Comida today. Our group of six had a leisurely meal. The chips were warm, crisp, and fresh. The guacamole ($8) was delicious. The grilled fish tacos ($12) were excellent! The Chicken Enchilada ($14) was just the right level of spicy. The Beef Fajita ($17) was very good, too. We also had an Ensalada Organica ($10). All the servings were generous. Beans and rice were served separately on two large platters so that our individual plates were not crowded and heaped with food. 

Our waiter Frank was efficient and friendly.  He made us feel very welcome. The noise level was low. La Comida was one of the best Mexican Restaurants we have experienced.. I went here to get my prom dress altered and she did a beautiful job! She did a bustle for my dress, repaired two hook and eyes, and hemmed the bottom. She was very kind and had the dress done within ten days. My dress was very nice lace and I would definitely recommend her.. Firesky Resort is great find. We had friends make the hotel resos, while we took care of other parts of the trip. 

As we walked into the lobby, it was pretty grand  without being too over done. Makes you feel totally comfortable upon walking in.  The staff was great- totally laid back, friendly and helpful.

Our room was good too, nothing too fancy, but everything you need.  Super soft sheets along with the perfectly weighted feather comforter.

The pool area is was fab, it's open 24 hours for a swim.  Where else do you find that at?  So, when it's still 95 degrees at midnight, you can cool yourself down quickly.  

Kimpton Hotels always include that special touch and this one is no different.  We'll be back and it was nice to venture out for our stay and still be so close to everything you need.. Fancy Spa for your car.  Expect to wait, worth every minute.  My car was impeccable.  The waiting room is super chill with free wi-fi, bottled water, TV and outlets for your chargers/laptops.  Definitely coming back!. Every time my husband and I are in Vegas, we visit Chinatown for some Banh Mi. We often go to Mr. Sandwhich but decided to give Dakao a try. OMG their banh mi is soo good! They're bread is perfect. crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. the thickness of the bread is not to doughy either. Their fillings are so good. I tried the veggie banh mi and hubby tried the vietnamese meatloaf. 

I think I may have found another favorite banh mi place in Vegas!. i am so wow-ed at how soft the bread is in on the inside and crunchy (but not hard!) on the outside.  on top of that, the bread is hot and steaming! 

i liked the lemonade iced tea, too

i would definitely come back here again since the prices are SO good for vegas..! next time i will eat my sandwich to-go while waiting in line to play Planet Hollywood's huge slot machine next door. Each day, you can go pull the slot machine once to test your chance to win 2 million.. Do you know how many Earl Sandwiches that is!?! And if you don't win the 2 mill, every one always wins something! Sometimes free slot play, a deck of cards, a hat.. whatevs!. OMG I JUST CAME FROM "THE PLACE"...  And I'm stufffffed!
EXCELLENT TASTING, BIG PORTIONS OF FOOD!
EXCELLENT FAST SERVICE!
PRICES WERE REASONABLE!
I only had to wait 10 minutes for a table.. not bad!  And so well worth it!
The only reason they don't get a five star is because they don't serve alcohol...  I love a bloody mary or a mimosa with my brunch!  But this is definitely a favorite for me... It's only like 2 miles from my home too, so awesome!. I've been coming here for since it was a small place that only served beer & wine. They've expanded, and now serve a full bar and also have a room in the back for cigar smokers. What a difference a couple years makes. The food has been consistently good, after the expansion, service was a bit iffy but it seems they have pulled it together. These happen to be a few of my favorites:

1. Really Trashy "Garbage" Salad, mixed greens, salami, Provolone cheese, shrimp, capers, hearts of palm, cherry peppers, and mushrooms in balsamic vinaigrette & a big mound of bleu cheese crumbles. Hand down BEST vinaigrette I've had.

2. Spaghetti Squash over Pasta, spaghetti squash with fresh Rroma tomatoes, garlic,
onions, basil and Parmesan cheese on spaghetti. 

3. Chicken & Artichokes (this is my favorite protein dish)

4.Chicken Tristina, A breast of chicken stuffed with grilled vegetables and mozzarella cheese on penne aglio olio con broccoli. 

5. Beef Wellington, this blows Smith & Wollensky away, can't even touch it.

6. Lobster Ravioli. Need I say more?

All entrees come with a house salad with my favorite dressing. For dessert you have to try Chef Al's NY cheesecake. This will ruin you for any cheesecake after you try this. The rice pudding is also a favorite of mine.. Yogurtini is AWESOME! My daughter wants to go here for any award/celebration! The flavored are so fun and they change them periodically to keep things interesting! If you haven't tried it you NEED to.. Great Price for a 4 course meal $15. If you read bad reviews from other yelpers, ignore them. This is a school with students learning the craft of fine food!. Very friendlyvand honest business. I presented with what I thought was a broken LCD screen and after they charged and reset my phone, it went back to working perfectly. They could very easily have claimed to have replaced the screen and I would have paid for it not knowing the difference. That honesty and integrity is hard to find in businesses and I greatly appreciate them for taking such good care of me. I break phones frequently and iRepair Plus has my business for life. :). We had a great experience, the only reason they didn't get 5 stars was the smell in the car was a little strong.  Not a bad smell, just the air freshener.  We would rent from them again and would recommend!  Check out was a breeze!  McCarren airport has the car rental process stream lined!. One of the best deals around.  We get a whole chicken and take half home.  Chicken has tasty, crispy skin, moist inside.  Black beans are a little too soupy, are best put over rice.  Fried plantains are delicious, salad crisp and fresh.  Their home made dressings are excellent.  Service is friendly and fast.   TV has all soccer, all the time.  Very interesting.  One of our favorite "I'm too tired to cook, let's go out" places.. This shop is a great addition to the Lawrenceville business district and Pittsburgh at large. The first time I walked in it seemed as though the store was created for me, so many awesome cards and locally made / handmade goodies. It's like having access to a great craft fair and assortment of Etsy sites anytime (well during business hours!) that I please, without crowds and shipping and handling. 

I recomend this store to everyone who needs a thoughtful, unique card or gift, as well as crafters and pinball enthusiasts. Check out this store, you won't be disappointed.. The food is incredible!! Despite getting caught in a thunderstorm, and having to wait in an awkwardly crowded area, it was totally worth it!! This was my first visit to Girasole. We were a group of 5 celebrating my daughters engagement. Shared a bottiglia di vino.  All of our dinners came with a fresh salad with sunflower seeds and a nice vinaigrette dressing and blue cheese. I ordered the fish, which was salmon. Unbelievable!! It was served over an artichoke purée and was cooked to perfection. Everyone tremendously enjoyed not only the food, but the atmosphere as well. A man was playing acoustic guitar Italian music. I am Italian, and this was the real deal!  I will definitely be going back!!! Love this place!!. I love hot dogs and now I happen to love Chicago dogs(haven't tried them until portillos opened). I also got to try a few bites of my boyfriends italian beef sandwich but he didn't get the peppers at all so now I have to make a separate trip to try it with the peppers soon.  I'm obsessed with the jumbo dogs and also have to try it charred just to see how that is (even though I'm not a crazy fan about burnt food.). The french fries were decent nothing that made me want to run for the hills and scream about it.  Between the jumbo Chicago hot dog and the italian beef I think that has me hooked enough. Still need to try more on the menu since it's pretty lengthy.  Last night I got the chocolate cake shake and good god that's the first time I haven't been able to finish a small shake. Way too sweet for me. Definitely something that's a one and done type of thing for sure. It's definitely got all the frosting and such in the shake and the texture threw me off a bit since it's not smooth. :( not my kind of thing. Weird for me to say just too much going on in that shake for me.. I've been here a bunch of times and have always had a good time! It's a much different atmosphere than most places I go in Madison, but that's what makes it fun. There's usually live music and some older couples dancing. I've never seen Essen Haus crowded, but there are always people there. The busiest I've seen it is during Stein Club on the 2nd Wednesday night of every month. Even then, though, the main dining room is pretty empty.

The best thing you can do here is get a boot (or 2 or 3) and share with your friends! Two of the times I've been here we were able to get some free t-shirts (1 shirt for every 3 boots finished) and we're up for the challenge of trying to get another.

This place is great for big groups or small groups (last night I came with 3 friends and played cards while sharing a boot). It's fun for just drinking or a heavy meal. On Thursday nights, boots are discounted. Not sure about other specials.. "fantastic music venue, great vibe, great food, top service"

The Duke is one of my two favourite places in Waterloo, Duke's, and Angie's diner next door. I went to both of them every day for the six days that I was in town. You need go no further! Angie's for brunch and Duke's at night for dinner and drinks and truly fantastic live music. 

The vibe at Duke's was great and people were friendly and every night the music was excellent. Go, because they have a roster with the same great people playing there, different each night and one better than the other. I enjoyed the variety and it just didn't matter that I was on my own. There was so much going on, such great entertainment that you can be there on your own and love it. Pretty much every night I was staying on til the music wraps up at 2.30am.

I was first there on the night of a big ice hockey game. It was a Monday night and the place was full and buzzing. There were tv screens on all the walls and although I'm Australian and a woman of 57, and know nothing about ice hockey, and not much about sport in general, in that great atmosphere, to my surprise I really enjoyed the game. 

And even more surprising for me, right after the game musicians started setting up and I tell you, they bowled me over! Fantastic stuff. The first guy played some amazing Spanish guitar. Two others then joined him and they played all sorts of great music, taking requests and going back in time to The Beatles, and they did that well too.

And the wait staff at Duke's are great .It's so busy, I don't know how they keep track of things. In particular, I was impressed with my waiter, on the night of the game, Stuart. Despite the crowds, he gave such good, professional but warm and friendly service. He took the time to re-direct me as I tried to place an order and made great recommendations; an excellent burger that if I recall properly was at half price that night. Try the chicken wings too. I had them another night and loved them. And of-course it's a great place to enjoy a beer.

A couple of nights after the game, I was at Duke's with my 24 year old son who is at Waterloo Uni on exchange; he happens to be a musician, and he loved the music at Duke's. 

After he left, I went for one of my favourite spots at Duke's on a little platform. There was enough seating for a couple of circles of people; there was a group of people in the 20s already there and a couple of other people to the right. As I went for the space between them, imagine my surprise to see that one person in the bigger group of young people stood up and called out "Oh look, my favourite customer!" It was my waiter from a couple of nights before, Stuart. He was on his night off and was with his friends, other locals, girls and boys, one friendlier than the other. He promptly invited me to join them. And it was a lot of fun being with them. How friendly is that?! My Australian friends who have travelled in Canada tell me that's Canadian for you! Really friendly.

Thanks Stuart. Thanks Duke's!

Go to them! The musicians are tops and so are the staff. It's a great pub in a great town.. You can't go wrong with this joint!  I've never had bad experience and there food is always on point from the breakfast burritos to the carne asana fries! Me and the fiancé love this place! Awesome customer service and clean! The 24 hour drive thru is a plus as well!. I love this place. Love it. I feel like a royal princess type person, and I haven't even really gambled here! Here's what I like about this hotel:

Instant upgrade to a huge suite
Cleanliness of everything
Pool -- so clean, and with many different ones, you can avoid gross people
Decoration -- SO modern and makes me never want to leave
View of Bellagio water show
Room service -- so speedy hubby and I barely had time to roll around naked in our piles of money on the bed before they rang the door
Beds -- so soft and comfortable, I seriously may never leave
Bathroom -- like a mini-mansion, only thing missing is a butler names "Chas"
Forum shops -- glamor glamor glamor
Costumes -- I heart togas. I can't help it. they're hot.. I was involved in a hit and run accident and although the damage was relatively minor, I wanted to have it repaired.  I had taken it to 2 other shops and received quotes of $850 and $1300.  I was trying to determine whether I should even bother having it repaired.  I ran across the reviews from this shop and thought it was worthwhile to at least get a quote.  I was blown away with their honesty!  Most of the damage was the paint from the other vehicle, which Tracy quickly 'wiped' away.  They then proceeded to glue my side mirror back together and told me how I could fix the remaining damage.  The gift that I received from this shop is not without gratitude and the very least I can do is write a review to let others know that this is an honest shop.  This is a shop I highly recommend and should I have a need for an auto paint and body shop in the future, will absolutely be the one that I go to.    
Thank you Tracy for your honesty!. Yummy!  Minus one star because its a little pricey. But the food really is great.. I love this place and so does my dog, Shelby! The staff is very friendly and attentive to Shelby. She goes here everyday for doggy day care, we have boarded her a few times while on vacation & she also gets her nails trimmed here. They do a great job with all of the above. The first time we boarded her, she lost some weight, but I think it's because she wasn't used to the environment overnight & was so busy playing she just didn't eat. The last few times, she's had no problem eating since she's so comfortable there. She's always excited to go inside when we pull up in the car and greets the staff excitedly. I highly recommend to anyone!. I'm not the one that usually takes the cars in for a wash as I find it to be an annoying process. I don't like being hit up for oil changes, glass replacement, or getting the heavy handed pressure to upsize the wash. None of that happened at TNT and man was that refreshing! 

Yelp check-in got me $4 off on my VIP wash which was a bonus! 

Prompt, friendly service, no high pressure sales, and my car done right the first time--boy should Cobblestone and Classic Auto Spa take note!. Red Velvet Cookies with a side of the icing and Red Velvet Cake. Vegan. Nuff said. If you don't believe me, just try either of the two and see for yourself. Thank me later.. Prompt and polite service. The menu is varied enough for just about any taste without being overwhelming. The spicy breakfast wrap was delicious (but not very spicy) and the egg croissant sandwich was flaky and buttery. The toast was slightly overcooked but had absolutely incredible flavor. We ordered triple shot americanos, the flavor was nice but mild (maybe that's just the Washington in me). The atmosphere was fun, bright and comfortable. I definitely recommend for those who need a break from the strip.. Let it be known with a gasp, that some people do exist in this world that (1) don't listen to house music and (2) have no desire to be in a packed club.  There is no "unce, unce, unce" here!  They play all popular songs and the dj's take requests.  Yep, the entire restaurant sang (at the top of their lungs) to Bon Jovi's, "Livin' on a Prayer!"  We had a soul train waiting in line for the bathroom and I did the "dougie" with both tables on either side of me while ordering!  Hands down, thee funnest steakhouse in Las Vegas.  

And yes, the ribeye and mac/cheese were fantastic.. I'm visiting and moving to the area in Sept and my aunt has been wanting to try it. We decided to come in for lunch before we headed across the street to do some shopping. My mom and aunt both ordered the Mahi tacos with iced tea and I ordered the grass-fed burger with cheese and a side order of sweet potatoes fries, with a ginger pomegranate lemonade. All entrees come with a kale and carrot salad with a simple olive oil/lemon juice dressing. 

I tried their tacos and they had a lot of flavor. The sweet potatoes were baked to the perfect consistency and served with an agave ketchup...delish! The burger was served on an oat bun and normally I don't eat bread like that but it was so delicious! The side salad was a little blah but I didn't mind it too much. My lemonade had the perfect blend of ginger and pomegranate! 

The only downside to the experience was the noise level in the place. It was so loud it was hard to hear my mom and aunt who were sitting across the table. I'll definitely go back but I think I will just do take-out instead!. I can't remember the last time I experienced great customer service at a fast food joint. Keep up the good work El Pollo Asst Manager!. I love the large room layout and the bathroom size! Check-in was fast an easy.  The location if the Venetian is close enough to the monorail for easy transportation and within a decent walking distance to see the Bellagio Water Show.. So happy I stopped by!  They have an awesome eggplant moussaka. Its served in a red sauce and the eggplant was cooked perfectly. Very glad it was served without the cream sauce that the Greek version has. This dish was actually healthy for you. 

Instead of the rice I opted for the grilled veggies and very glad I did. I think they could serve the grilled veggies with a salad as a main dish they were that good. 

I will definitely be going back again.. Who's a sap? Not this girl... But I will dedicate my 50th review here. Why you ask? I got engaged here! The pool and rooftop patio are the highlights of this establishment. The deck uptop has an amazing city view. There really isn't a "bar" persay. More like a tub of drinks. (Have cash). The tables are sub par, but they have fun plants with colorful  orb lights and the ambiance seems to create itself. Better hope you can hike a few stairs, as the elevator caps off a floor too early.
The pool used to be free to locals and is now 10 bucks per person, per day. Bring your own towel. You can drink at the pool and it's gorgeous. Fun and bright tiles with starlike lights under the water, a light water cascade, and music. Comfy seating with couchlike beds or these odd sling chairs that are surprisingly cozy. There's also a huge hotub (that was engagement place). Also had my bachelorette party here (I shall not post pics of that). Gallo Blanco (the hotel restaurant) has some cheap tacos if you get hungry, too. Item costs vary and it's quite an eclectic menu. The drinks are for sure overpriced with light pours. 
We have stayed in the rooms and they are okay. The hotel basically reminds me of a halfway done house remodel. Don't stay here if you want something ultra fancy. The doors are labeled with license plates. It all just seems like a start to something that keeps that downtown feel, but is trying too hard to be fancy. A bit hipster, really. 
Clarendon is an odd gelling of superb and work still to be done. Its small and mimics more of an apartment complex than hotel. Come with an open mind and don't miss the sunset.
This place will for sure always hold a special place in my heart.. I stopped in on my way to work as soon as I read it was open... a delicious chocolate chip cookie with walnuts (I think?) put me in a good enough mood to actually go to work, and my perfect iced latte got me through the night shift. I'm so glad Royal opened up in the Biltmore, that area definitely needs a good coffee spot. And so do I, right on my short commute. :) The space inside is nice, though it's small, I think it is modern and clean and inviting, good for a stop-in and fuel-up, if not a long lingering stay.. We ordered the chicken skins, fried green tomatoes sliders,  veal meat balls.. All were delicious. It was easy to get a seat in the cozy restaurant.. HE IS THE BEST HOOK UP IN TOWN!!!!! Hands down.  I go to Vegas a lot and ALWAYS use he's services. I'm never disappointed.  Ladies, you definitely need to hit him up if you want the VIP treatment.  I didn't get paid to write this.  I'm just a satisfied and grateful customer :D. Bocata was the perfect antidote to a cold, gray day in Montreal. We sat at the bar and received great service.   Fantastic oysters from PE Island,  a lovely stuffed pepper and fantastic cod as an entree.  Our waiter made great wine and food suggestions.. i'm not one for touristy crap but i really enjoyed this and highly recommend!
i went during the day, where it is cheaper, less crowded, and you get to see the beautiful desert landscape.
Open bar is a must- it's only $5 extra during the day and you can easily get 2-3 drinks in.  our bartender was the nicest guy ever, funny, and hooked up our drinks nicely.  our pod had a small group - only 6 people.
JUST MAKE SURE YOU PEE BEFORE YOU GET ON!
also, even though i liked it a lot, i 'wouldn't wait in a long line for it.  there was no line at all when we went.. Went with Scooter after several recommendations. He was excellent, no high-pressure sales tactics, made me look and feel fabulous, and was really quick/efficient, but thorough. I wanted a natural look but something that would stand out on camera. He used just the right colors to accentuate the positive and diminish the negative. I ended up purchasing some eye shadow liner, a liner brush, and a lip liner that I love! He is super talented - but book in advance as his schedule seemed busy.. Mochi mandu soup for a hangover. Point blank period.. Bouchon Bakery has been an obsession of mine lately.  Namely, I'm obsessed with their cupcakes (and I am not a fan of the trendy cupcake movement).

My latest visit came after a one-month, self-imposed sugar ban.  And, because I love these trendy little cakes so much, I chose to break my fast on a Bouchon chocolate cupcake!

The basis for my obsession is that the frosting will not put you into a diabetic coma.  The sweetness is doable. Further, the chocolate frosting tastes more like a mousse, less like a birthday cake.   If I wanted a cupcake that tastes like birthday cake, I'll make it myself (and you do not want to see me bake...scary).

And, at $3.50, these are a pretty good deal -- smaller, less delicious cupcakes in Las Vegas can be had for $2.50.  The selection, however, is limited--I've only ever seen chocolate and red velvet.  Both are good.

Bouchon Bakery is a great way to experience Thomas Keller without dropping a few hundred at his restaurant upstairs.  I do wish they'd serve up some tables though! What is up with that!?! Come on!. Maybe I've had a sheltered life, but these are the best tacos I've ever had. So delicious. The staff was nice and I loved sitting along the window people watching.. I've owned dogs for most of my life but never had a breed that needed to be professionally groomed before.  I recently adopted a little cairn terrier type dog who was looking pretty rough.  After getting some meat on his bones and letting his neuter incision heal, I was finally able to get him cleaned up!  I did lots of research and read tons of reviews and decided on this place since they had great reviews and is less than 2 miles from my house.  

I came in today for my appointment and the staff was super friendly!  I didn't have any clue what kind of grooming I wanted so they helped me decide and spent a good amount of time discussing options.  I let the groomer know I wanted it short (but not the shortest option she showed me) and said she could use her judgment on the rest.  I had no clue what to ask for or even what to expect!  

A few hours later I came back to get him and he was so freaking adorable, soft and clean!  He was happy and obviously had a good experience while he was there.  

I was most impressed with the fact that when I went to check out I was told that they weren't going to charge me one of the fees we talked about because it was barely needed.  How often do you go somewhere and the fee is less than what you were quoted?  That proves to me they aren't money hungry and value my business more than a few extra bucks.  

Will be back without a doubt and will be bringing both my pups next time!!. Finally made it into Duckworth's for a Girls Night Out recently. We ordered a bevvy of different brews, salads and appetizers. Everything was  good and the service at our table was fantastic.  The service in the bar area was not so great as the bar was super-busy. 

It definitely is a happening place with plenty of drink specials and a brew for just about anyone.  Our server was able to suggest a couple of options besides just the standard options like Redbridge (brewed from Sorghum) or Budweiser (primarily rice) for one member of our party who is senstive to gluten. 

The bar area is a good size and there are plenty of tables and booths in the rest of the place. TV screens are everywhere in case you are looking for a place to watch some sports. 

The menu had a nice variety of entrees, sandwiches and salads.  I am looking forward to going back for lunch or dinner next time.. So here is my take on the Vig, if you are trying to "not be scottsdale, but really you are scottsdale" the VIg is the place to go.  Its for the "hipster scottsdale crowd that thinks they are escaping scottsdale only to realize everyone from scottsdale is there, ha ha.  I am not saying i don't like this place  . . . . but for being in Phoenix there were a ton of Scottsdale LA Fitness guys from my gym there, weird?

Anyway time for my real review.  They have awesome happy hour food at cheap prices.  So a great place for dinner/hh.  When the weather is nice its good to go, since the majority of the bar is outside.  I like the crowd at the VIg, a bit older (27-40) and more refined, he he.  

Another pro they offer free rides home if you get too drunk, so drink up!. My child attended VVL from kindergarten to 6th grade and graduated 3 years ago.  And he loved  going to school there, EVERYDAY! 
* His teachers were all excellent, as well as the principals (Susie Apel and Patrick Miller).
*The special ed department and services were first rate, and helped us to guide our child in to the junior high program.
*The orchestra and band program were terrific! 
*The PTSO was effective, and impressive in fund raising.
I highly recommend this elementary school to any parent looking for a caring, kind, and effective school community.. Bacon jam is the jam.  Came here with a small group and ordered almost everything.  The table favorites were the bacon jam, the meatloaf sliders and the scallops.  The tater tots were really good as well, nothing like the cafeteria ones I ate growing up.. The Beehive is quieter than most Grassmarket pubs, and bigger, and cozier. The interior is lovely, and looks quite historic. There are big tables for bigger parties and booths tucked away in the back for couples to cuddle up in. I haven't yet checked out the beer garden, but it's on my list for that rare sunny day. 

Although it's a chain (sigh) the food is quite good and reasonably priced (Nicolsons, I'm looking at you). We had the lamb & mint pie and fish & chips, and they were both cooked perfectly, the flavors were spot-on and the portions generous, each for under a tenner. There's a good selection of ales, including a seasonal rotation of local offerings, and the bar staff are kind enough to give tastes when you're unsure of what you're after.. LIL PINK was the best party bus I have ever been on!!!! It was for a Bachelorette but would be fun for any occasion in Vegas!!! For my first time in Vegas, it was beyond what I ever expected! Mike was on time, professional, and was always easy to get a hold of!!!!. I was FINALLY able to sit down and enjoy a meal here, and while the food didn't *quite* live up to my longstanding high expectations (um, have you tried their bread pudding?), it was good enough.

We started with the Guacamole and Sizzlin Peppers; the guacamole was flavorful with a hint of spice, but the accompanying salsas didn't so much compare. That's okay though, the guacamole was plentiful. The Sizzlin' Peppers were delish. So simple and understated yet SO good. A nice alternative to your standard deep fried peppers, these were grilled and stuffed with a three cheese variety that complimented the peppers wonderfully. Not to mention, the peppers were fiery hot...what a nice surprise for a girl who likes her heat. 

My husband ordered the Sangria, which wasn't overly sweet (bonus!). It was a large glass and a deal at $7. 

For entrees my husband ordered the Vegetarian sandwich sans portobello (why must all vegetarian sandwiches/wraps/entrees fall into the same realm of grilled vegetables? I make some mean vegetarian dishes at home that go way beyond the portobello). It arrived with the mushroom, no biggie, he just took it off. Otherwise it was a solid win: crusty ciabatta, melted jalapeno jack cheese, grilled grey squash and asparagus, finished with a pesto spread and balsamic reduction. The sandwich also came with a side of green chile posole (that I made him order), and while it was good, I was expecting a bit more spiciness and flavor. 

I ordered the North Central Chicken, served with a red chile glaze, roasted poblano creamed corn, grilled asparagus, and house mashed potatoes. The chicken itself was just okay. It was grilled perfectly, however I found the chile glaze to be overly sweet and taste more like barbeque sauce. The poblano creamed corn and house mashed potatoes were tasty, and the asparagus was nicely grilled as well. 

Of course we ordered the bread pudding for dessert (and ordered an extra to go, for our babysitters) and while I ate half at the restaurant and planned on eating the remainder for breakfast the next morning, I couldn't help myself and quickly ate the rest upon returning home. I am telling you - SO GOOD. Probably to die for.

All in all, it was a nice experience. The service was okay; our server wasn't the "friendliest" so to say, but that's fine with me. Our drinks never went unfilled and our food arrived in a timely manner. While I much prefer the Southwestern cuisine from Rokerij or Dick's, I'll definitely be returning here for the bread pudding time and time again.. I would actually rate this place with three stars but the service actually made me add another.

I've dined here on several occasions and each time was because I was REALLY HUNGRY and wasn't feeling the wait at either Goyemon or Sushi Koma during prime times (around 7pm) of the night. This place can really turn and burn- and for an AYCE restaurant? I'm quite impressed.

The quality of the food wasn't there for me. The first couple of bites after coping with starvation is good but it's sad to realize that you're judgement will drastically change once you're 30% full. The menu is more extensive than most AYCE restaurants but I guess that's why you're getting mediocre quality dealing with the amount of overhead this place carries. The fresh oysters? Probably my favorite part of the place but it limits one time order per diner. Bummer, really.

The service really stood out for me. The staff didn't mind how busy it was and was heavily focused on attending to our every need. Water refills, clearing empty plates off the table, letting our server know that we wanted to order more; their teamwork have earned their high tip since working at an AYCE restaurant can seem annoying.

The best part? Food will literally come out the minute after you order. I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing but it was definitely good since we were hungry. If I'm ever on a time restraint, I'll come back. If I'm looking for quality vs. quantity, I won't. This place has its perks though.. I am not quite sure what previous customers are talking about, perhaps they have the wrong company in mind (or they were just one of those people who cannot be pleased), because my experience with Jumparound Party Jumpers was the complete opposite. The bounce house was not only clean, it looked brand new! The snow cone mechine was very clean and I had absolutely no issues when using it. The delievery was on time, if not early. They were more than curtious and more than accomidating for us two overly exausted/stressed mothers with six kids between the two of us, who had been up all night trying to make the party happen. I could not reccomend this company more. And with our six children they will definatly be getting all of our buisness! I mean really, what occasion isn't made 2000% better by a bouncy house??!?. Had the Loco Moco last night.  It sure took care of my cravings.  It's conveniently by my house and I will be sure to come back for more.. I love this location. I used to go here at least once a week until I moved across town. Awesome lunch specials, fantastic staff and great food fast. Vegetarian pad thai is my fave, but the house chicken is to die for and the Mongolian beef is good too. :D 

Plus its in the smiths parking lot so we you can grab a bite before grocery shopping.. Joy Squad was FANTASTIC to work with! Leslie was a gem and so easy to communicate with. They are quick, easy to book, hassle free the day of. The Photo Booth at my wedding was beautiful and the team did an awesome job setting it all up, putting together the scrapbook and disassembling when the time came. All the guests had a blast with it, and I loved looking through all the pictures after the wedding!. I stopped in for a pedicure & was very pleased with the experience. I asked that it be expedited & the young lady accommodated very well. She gave a great leg/foot massage which I recommend highly. She also was friendly but not intrusive to me. They are pretty busy though, Which is actually a good thing. I will move my rating up depending on how the pedicure lasts!. There's never anyone in the restaurant when I come which is very surprising to me because it is so good! Great house music always playing in the background and the sushi is absolutely delicious! Get the Miso soup and the crunchy scallop roll, SO GOOD. The only reason I took away a star is because the server is always bored so he isn't the most kind. The food makes up for it!!. Came here and saw Will.I.Am we got in for free with a promoter. This was the first time I had been to Light but I've been to XS, Surrender, Marquee, Drais and Chateau. Light is my new favorite! We stationed ourselves at a standing table and Will.I.Am was literally 2 feet from us which was awesome! I love the music too because it was a mix of EDM and pop/hiphop. There were also shot girls that came around and cirque de soleil people in the ceiling. Everyone was very friendly and the drinks aren't watered down, what more can you ask for!?. I remember back when this place had its original name, Plaisant Croissants. I'm glad that it's still here offering buttery rich pastries and sandwiches.

I stepped in and ordered an egg and cheese croissant and a Bavarian cream. The croissants themselves were light, buttery, and flaky. The egg in the sandwich was fluffy and scrambled, with melted cheese in it. The Bavarian cream had a decent amount of filling in it, although a little more would have been nice!

The egg sandwich was $5.25 and the Bavarian cream was $2.25. The interior is cute with French cafe influences. 

Definitely a good stop to indulge in a French inspired breakfast!. Fab... Can't believe we are getting just fantastic restaurants in Phoenix........ Awesome spot, I found this place two weeks ago and I've already been 4 times. Super good.. My husband and I love this place!!  The staff is so friendly, the wine selection is good and the food, especially the happy hour appetizers, are really tasty. We love to go here and chat with the bartenders and have a nice relaxing time.. I'm reluctant to review this location since it's where I find all my greatest deals and really, I don't want to share with you. But I will since we're friends.

50% off Saturday's are CRAZY. Be prepared. If you are clostraphobic you should avoid it at all costs. However, you can get smokin' deals on pretty much everything if you're willing to deal with massive crowds. This Saturday I got close to $200 worth of pristine Anne Taylor dresses, slacks, and shirts for about $15 - total. 

This store is clean and doesn't smell like dead people. A huge bonus in my book. It's well organized and the people that work there are really helpful. One of the better thrift stores in the area by far.. Anyone who knows me, knows that I love breakfast. Also they would know that I love anything red velvet. Finding out that Baby Stacks cafe had red velvet pancakes was a dream come true. 

This cafe is a dream come true. Cute quaint little place with a family feel. The portions are huge, you can share if you like and still come out full. The red velvet pancakes are to die for. Light fluffy, red of course, covered in chocolate chips and whipped cream. Yum!

You can't go wrong with this place. The staff is friendly and attentive, I never had to flag someone down to get a refill on my coffee, and again has a nice homey feel while still maintaining excellent customer service standards. I'll keep coming back!. Made our way over to this small but impressive wine bar.  We ordered the "wine on special" as well as cheese and meat plate.  From what I understand, they feature a wine for $5 every day and we thought, "why not".  It was red and it was delicious...unfortunately I can't remember the name.  

The cheese and meat plate was great - more than enough for 3 people to share some light nibbles while sipping on wine.  They also have more than wine - like champagne, cocktails and beer - but I strongly suggest the wine.  

Definitely want to check this place out again!. Dear Angell Park, even when I don't know who's behind the wheel any more it's still pretty cool to see those guys drive the hell out of that clay track. Old school fun. Thanks for the nostalgia! You're still cool. Xoxo Stephanie. Simply the best day spa I've ever experienced. All others will pale in comparison. You have been warned.

I've been going to Qua since 2007 but it just struck me that I have yet to write a review. Time to give Qua its much deserved five stars.

I don't book any treatments here. I just pay the $45 for all day access and enjoy the quintessential gym and spa day. You honestly need nothing else.

The sides are gender separate, meaning also that nudity is an option. If the sight of a 300 pound woman or 80 year old senior baring it all makes you uncomfortable, then you need more Vegas in your life.

Qua has numerous Roman style baths of varying depths and temperatures. The heated stone chaises are ahmaazing; while the waterfall showers are sort of weak and a bit meh. Then there's the ice room, which rains bubbles down every 15 minutes. I like moving between this room and the eucalyptus steam room. So refreshing. And if you want some dimly lit quite time, the lounge area is fairly comfortable with an ample stock of various teas and fresh fruit.

Getting all primped up afterward is easy too. They have everything. Including products you didn't even think you needed until you tried them; from luster sprays to volumizing foam and dry finishers. Lots of room to spread your make up and supplies around. Great lighting. Everyone walks out of here looking fresher faced and more relaxed. 

There isn't much more to say that hasn't been said by all these 5-star reviews. Vegas is hard enough on your body, so reward it once in a while by taking some time out at Qua. Once you do, it'll be so hard for you to go without. Who knew peace, quiet, and serenity could be so indulgent.. I loved Sandra! I brought in my dress to be altered in January for a December wedding. She had me go over what I wanted to change. I needed to add sleeves and bring up the back of my dress but I wanted it to look like it was all one dress and not just sleeves tacked on. Well, I ended up moving  my wedding date to April and she was so accommodating. Even with some miscommunication about the date she had my dress ready for pictures previous to the wedding and then I brought it back to her so she could bustle it. She took lace from the bottom of my dress and used that to continue the lace and beading of my bodice into a sleeve. It looks flawless. She also brought up the back with the same lace and I was able to keep my lace up back. I don't know how she did it but it was amazing! Also very affordable. Sandra will make you look fabulous!! She is great at understanding what you want and making it happen.. The Aegean Club is ridiculously good and makes this place stand out from other Greek places already. Happy hour is fantastic as well. Great prices on beer you actually want to drink! Definitely will be revisiting. We love this place, great flavors and great toppings. The staff is always so nice. 
A few new flavors. U can eat inside or outside.. My job treated us to "Ice Cream" today for doing well on our client survey. I walked to the designated area thinking I would see some store brought Ice Cream with bowls/cones and toppings, but to my surprise the King Of Pops cart was set up!! I was so excited since he comes to our building every Friday anyway  and I always wanted to try it... but couldn't bring myself to pay $3 for a popsicle!! You're talking to someone who grew up with $1 Popsicles off the neighborhood Ice Cream Truck. So today I positioned myself in line with the rest of my coworkers excited!! When I got to the front of the line the guy was very friendly! He asked what I wanted and I told him with a smile the Blackberry Ginger Lemon please!! He grabbed my popsicle, quickly cut the wrapper for me and handed me my popsicle and I immediately took my first lick. NOW THIS IS A POPSICLE FOR ADULTS!!!! I grinned all the way back to my office! This popsicle was so delicious that I stopped after every office on the way making sure everyone knew they needed to go get their popsicle!! They couldn't miss this. The Blackberry Ginger Lemon was packed with the perfect blend of all 3 flavors. Not to sweet and not too much Ginger which I was worried about. I could not resume work until I finished the entire popsicle. Now I know that they are well worth the price and I can't wait to Stalk the truck out on Friday to try another flavor! I went back by to take a few pictures and the guy working asked me how I was enjoying my popsicle. I said it's delicious and he smiled and said he was glad I liked it. I love service with a smile.... I have been receiving massages from Massage Heights for the past year. I have received at least a hundred massages and am not exaggerating when I say Ricardo is the best massage therapist I have ever worked with. He was able to completely correct my poor posture and assisted in healing my migraines through therapeutic massage. He even helps me understand different stretches that will help reduce muscle pain.. This is the place where you should go for your drink, they provide excellent service; workers are friendly , there are many varieties of choices on menu. My mixed fruit drink tasted very delicious!. I have 2 cats, and I love this place.  I buy them things like Innova Evo (dry and canned) and Nature's Variety frozen raw meat medallions, which are difficult to find.  I can get the Evo at the Tempe Feed & Tack, but they don't have a freezer for the other food.  Sunflower even has the canned duck, which one of my cats inhales.  Previously, I was going all the way out to In the Raw in Gilbert for the frozen stuff, ugh!  I'm so thrilled this little place opened!  It's not too far from my house, and the owner is awesome.  Great product selection.  Closed on Sunday.. I love this place. But I want to be clear that I haven't eaten here! It's mostly because my fellow yelpers have said that the food is not that good. Now I will, eventually, eat here. I just haven't yet. 

So this review is based on the place itself, the drinks and the service.

This place is adorable. I love the decor! I love the patio! It's so pretty, cute, morbid, Frenchy all rolled into an awesome ball that works. Every time I come, I discover something new. My favorite areas to note are the hall of chandeliers, the beautiful tile hopscotch, Cinderella's carriage (I pretend it's hers) and the teeter-totter in the smoking section (somewhat hidden in the back). I love bringing out-of-town friends here and they all love it.

I've tried a few of their house specialty drinks, and really I have no complaints. The drinks are good. Although sometimes they taste as if they don't have much alcohol in them. They have this pear beer, which is super tasty. I'm not a big beer drinker, so those of you that are, pay no attention to my beer recommendation!! Haha. But those of you that like fruity and crisp, and don't know crap about beer, try it.

The service is always quick and friendly.. My fault for not making reservations and requesting my friend Nick to be our waiter.  However, nothing is like a night out on the town dressed up with Blair B., her husband Mike B., and Eric R.!  We each brought restaurant.com coupons, and ended up using the $50 off $100 (what a deal!)  The coupon includes alcohol.

Mike B. proudly picked the wine with his wine app, so I said we would go with it.  It was okay, but since Blair already said it wasn't her favorite, I will go ahead and agree (I am not much for red wine but did it for my heart, baby!)

We started off with complementary bruschetta, bread and olive oil/basalmic, and the wine.  Gaetano himself gave us the specials, and there were like 42 of them.  Our waiter finally reviewed them with us (though a few were sold out) and we were more confused (the menu is already big as it is).  I ended up getting the butternut squash ravioli with sage and brown butter, and magnificent it was!  The beef carpaccio appetizer was also delicious and at least I can say our waters were refilled rapidly.  Eric R. ordered a veal dish as his main and a half order of the special risotto of the day, bay scallop and shiitake.  It was outstanding and I couldn't stop eating it.

To top it off, my friend Nick sent over via our waiter complementary "house cappucinos" which were essentially hot bittersweet chocolate with 3ish liqueurs and topped with whipped cream.  Eric R. was skeptical because he hates coffee and when he tried it, he was relieved.  YUM!. Stumbled upon this after lunch one day.  The lady who took our order was very friendly & their menu was pretty interesting, I just went with an iced coffee & a shot of espresso over ice, it was $2.50 for both drinks, not bad at all.  The drinks came with a chocolate espresso bean on top of the lid, cute.  Next time I'm in the area I'll be stopping by again to try some other drinks out.. I loved this place!

In meeting a girlfriend for a boozy lunch, I picked Michael Neave due to the great reviews from Joe A and Steph D. I wasn't disappointed. They sold the place well and accurately! 

Their sat lunch set menu was £11.95 for 2 courses or £14. 95 for 3. What a bargain! Only another 3 bucks for a yummy dessert! However.... In true 'Laura and Elaine' style we ended up choosing from the al a carte, the steak just too tempting an option for me to pass up. 

My olive and mull cheddar tart was divine as were the tiny, warm homemade sun dried tomato bread rolls (I asked for more... Well I WAS hungover!!) which were served with your own individual serving of butter. Yum. Elaine's pigeon breast with smoky bacon also went down a storm. I had a taste and the thick lardons of bacon were delish and really made a difference. 

My steak was tasty, I asked for medium well and although it was slightly done a little more well, i really didn't mind. It was seasoned beautifully but simply, the right mix of saltiness and spice. The fondant potato that came with it could have gone wrong (as they so often do) but it was perfect! Soft fluffy potato. It soaked up the nice bottle of French white wine we had nicely. 

Dessert. Well. This was a slight let down but before I continue, they redeemed themselves more than I could have expected so I'm not marking them down. I chose sticky toffee pudding which I'd spied immediately upon first seeing the menu and it didn't matter what else I was eating I WAS HAVING THAT PUDDING!! So....It did look lovely but it had a funny taste which I couldn't place... Kind of doughy, like it wasn't cooked properly. Gutted.com! For once the waiter was nowhere to be seen so it sat uneaten for about 15 mins before he came back into the restaurant. I explained I didn't like the taste - was this a problem for them? No! He immediately apologised and I was offered something else. I chose the pistachio and elderflower parfait which was lovely, tart and creamy. 

Another 2 glasses of wine and some coffee and we were ready to leave. Upon presenting the bill the waiter said BOTH desserts and BOTH glasses of wine were on the house with the apologies from the chef!! This goes to show, it's not about the mistake, it's how it's rectified! 

The shame was the place was empty. On a sat afternoon! I know they are trying to build up custom slowly but they do deserve to be busy... So go forth my yelpers and scoff some of the highest quality food and experience some of the best service in Edinburgh! 

I just really hope they don't let their current standards slip like so many restaurants do.... Best pizza to ever hit my mouth. Seriously this is the best pizza in all of Phoenix. You have to try the spicy meatball, it is literally to die for.. Friendly Service and a DYNAMITE menu of coffee, teas and other nifty edibles. My favorite drink is the Creme Brûlée Latte. I am completely addicted to it. They also have Jasmine tea and that is another favorite of mine. I also enjoy the fact that they can email your receipts to you , less paper and impact on our Earth. Sunrise is centrally located and lovley little gem of Las Vegas.. A real urban pizzeria, love the set up, love the food.

A small fast food type eatery where you order your food beforehand and pay for your food beforehand and they'll bring it to you when it's ready.
Main floor has lots of quick snacks and prepackaged meals if you're on the go, like soups, salads, fruit cups, juice blends..

Their pizzas are prepared and heated fresh for you, only complaint is that their pepperoni is extremely salty.

They have a bunch of sandwiches and wraps - i love the chicken cesar one. Portions are decent, but prices a bit high.
They also serve smoothies which look like a small cup and charge 4$ - I could get a much bigger gulp elsewhere that's for sure...

Antone and James is a trendy place, you really feel like you're living the downtown experience when you eat upstairs, facing the window where you can people watch.. Since moving out of state, I haven't had access to those cheap Chinese foot massages that are all the rage in So. CA now.  On a recent visit to Vegas, my friends and i decided to take a break from gambling to get one.  We have been to numerous Chinese foot massage parlors all over the world, including in China. This was one of the better ones if you don't mind putting up with a little chaos. 

I called to make appointments for four of us about 45 minutes ahead of time.  When we walked in, we were the only clients and everything proceeded very nicely for a while.  They set us up in comfy lounge chairs, then soaked our feet in hot water while Peter massaged my neck, shoulders and scalp (I was seated on the ottoman facing the chair). The neck and shoulders was heavenly but the scalp was basically just scratching which didn't do anything for me.  After about 15 minutes, I was instructed to sit on the chair with my feet on the ottoman and he began to massage my legs and feet. Tea was offered, which was nice and I really began to relax.  But it was not to last. A family of 5 plus two kids walked in without appointments and that is when everything went haywire. All four of our masseuses got onto their cell phones to dial desperately for reinforcements.  Peter seemed to be in charge because he spent the most time on the phone.  After a while, I told him just to stop massaging my leg and finish his calls because he was using one hand to hold his phone while repeatedly rubbing one leg as he talked and I didn't feel he was focused. He apologized repeatedly and got up to finish his call.  He also gave me a couple of extra minutes at the end to make up for the time he was away.

After the feet, he massaged my arms and hands a bit before sliding out a 2nd ottoman, thus extending the chair into a bed.  After covering the bed with towels, he had me lie down on my stomach with my head hanging off the ottoman and my feet on the chair.  He then proceeded to massage my back and OMG it was wonderful!

I'm sure there was more to the massage, but this is what I recall.  Despite the chaos, everyone was very nice, very professional and I would definitely go again next time I'm in town.  Everyone in the group enjoyed their massage and we all just sort of laughed and accepted that this is the price you pay for an inexpensive massage.  Angel, the owner, showed up (as part of the reinforcements) and was very friendly.  

$38 for 60 minutes, we added on $7 for tip to make it $45/person.  I took off one star for the chaos.  By the way, don't expect authentic reflexology here.  I've done that and they are VERY painful.  These places say they offer reflexology, but it is really nothing more than an excellent massage by a skilled amateur.  Still feels oh-so-good, though!. 5 Stars for Dr.Sampson, he's a wonderful compassionate vet and I will only go to him. The lady at the front desk with the strong European accent is really bad for business as she is very abrupt on the phone and in person. The vet tech with puppy paw tattoos was so great with my animals and a really sweet woman.. I prefer this location than the one on State St. The slices seem hotter, fresher, and greasier (YUM) here. Can't say anything bad about the food at all. 

(+) Good, greasy, cheesy goodness. Come here a lot from LA and found you on Yelp, waitress and owner was very nice and food was very good, loved my biscuits and gravy :) will be back again.. By far my absolute favorite hotel in Las Vegas. If you have the money go to the Wynn! I like it better than the Bellagio, no joke. Everything about the Wynn just screams CLASSY.

The Decor is gorgeous. The Shopping is great. The restaurants are killer. Le Reve is a Great show. If you go to Vegas and stay at the Wynn,  you never really have to leave. They have everything. The high end suites are to die for. They have living room, kitchen, bar, separate bathroom and all decorated in plush reds.  I will seriously have a hard time trying out other Vegas hotels now that I have experienced the Wynn.. What a gem! I love the atmosphere and the ambiance. We had the Lamb Sliders and they were delicious. Our server was great. She was on top of everything (and there were 8 of us).. Went in to have a flat checked out. The staff was extremely friendly, knowledgable, and courteous. Sadly the flat was too busted to repair (which is free), but they gave me a tire on loan for no charge until my new tire could be shipped. The comfortable waiting room atmosphere, free water while you wait, and fast service makes this Discount Tire shop number one on my list.. My boyfriend and I had our first date here and it remains our absolute favorite place. The food is awesome. I loooooove the black bean soup!!!! My fave. I also love the house salad with the watermelon vinaigrette. The fries are great! My guy says the burger is BOMB. I can't tell ya cause I am gluten intolerant so I can't touch the bun. Service and atmosphere is great, I love the farm house type feel. Well done place!:). Very tasty and friendly service at the market. Picked up some fresh ground Turkish coffee while there.. Popped in for the first time tonight and loved it!  The comfortable atmosphere reminded me of my many visits to the beach, which is one of my favorite places!  We were greeted with a warm welcome and our waitress was very attentive, but not too much you know?  

I had the pear salad ($8) ... grilled pear, baby field greens, bleu cheese, candied nuts, cranberry and vinaigrette and added a crab cake ($8).  For the price, the crab cake could have been bigger, but then sometimes you pay a little more for the experience.  It was relaxing and enjoyable.  I'll make an effort to go back very soon.. never being desapointed by pho because no other ethinicie than real vietnamese people will try to open a pho place enough said great soups and taste authentic and fresh. The Map Room is where my boyfriend and I went on our first date, and we've gone back every year since then. I've also come here on two or three occasions other than our annual dates when living in the neighborhood, and this darling Regent Square mainstay has definitely grown on me! The atmosphere is cozy and old-timey with plenty of friendly locals, wood trim, framed maps on the walls, and cool map etchings on glass partitions. (Hence the name!) The service is always friendly, albeit a bit slow on a couple of understaffed occasions, but it's a small place and I'm more than willing to wait a bit so long as the service is pleasant.

The beer and liquor prices are really good, which is why it's nice to come for drinks. They have a draft list with about twelve options and twice as many bottled beers to choose from. Things like Flying Dog seem to be $1.50-$2.00 cheaper than pretty much anywhere else even if the selection is smaller. For those who don't want beer they have a menu of throwback cocktails (think Gin Rickey and Tom Collins) for reasonable prices similar to that of Kelly's in East Liberty. On top of all this whenever I've ordered their food it's been really delicious and definitely a cut above dive bar fare in terms of greasiness and taste. I've never been here and not seen multiple tables full of people eating and looking very satisfied with their meals, so I know it's not just me. I'm glad The Map Room is still open after seeing Dunning's close (the area needs another late-night food spot besides D's) and I hope it stays that way for a while yet! I'll be coming back (at least once a year) so long as it does.. Annie Annie Annie - she's the best waxing specialist there and anywhere for that matter. I now have my whole group of friends who have left their usual wax place for Annie! 
She is super cool, makes you feel comfortable, but most importantly, does the best job. I go to her every few weeks for a full bikini wax and she makes it simple, quick, and virtually painless. 
Ive been to other waxers and she noticeably does a better job and much less discomfort. 
I also love the wax here- much less painful and so much smoother, last longer, no breakouts, and no paper rip off. Best waxing specialist = Annie and I love the Shadyside location!. 5 guys is a fun place to go for a "I need a stack of meat!" fix. Whoever the 5 guys are, they take pride in an overfilled burger with toppings oozing out the sides! Thank you for the THICK cut tomato and grilled onions....mmmmm. Licked my fingers more than once after polishing off a double patty (I think I will pass on eating dinner now, thanks). The fries are thick cut and full salt (more finger licking). No, I am pretty sure there is not a healthy item on the menue...so this is a treat...but a welcome one. As far as the pricing goes...yep it is a bit pricey...but I can spend $6-7 on a "value" meal at a fast food joint...why not get some real meat and toppings for a few bucks more...Share the fries there is more than enough to go around :). I was originally planning a park party for my daughter's 3rd birthday, but a few days prior, we decided to have it at the house. With all of the changes in location, times, and even changing the entertainer; they were great replying to my emails and accommodating all of my changes. Even the day of the party, I called to be sure they were coming to the house and received a call back assuring me. We finally decided on Candace as "Pinky the clown" as opposed to Ariel since a few boys were attending. What a great choice! Candace arrived a few minutes early and pleasantly greeted my daughter at the door. She was adorable. We did the face paintings first. I only had about 5 kids, so a few of my adult friends asked for fake "tattoos." Candace pleasantly agreed and my adult guests were extremely impressed with her skills. The kids asked for everything from full Iron Man faces to Spider Man and Ariel. She created all of them without any picture reference or hesitation. We moved Candace to another location for the balloons and she was quick to pack up and unload her new supplies. The balloons were also fantastic. From butterfly wings, to swords, spider mans and peace signs, she did it all. The kids and the adults loved her. I can't speak for the other entertainers, but Candace was fantastic. And customer service was great too. Thank you!. I Live close by....this place is awesome!!!! It has it all and the park is still adding more activities to their park!!!!. i love this place when i'm not sober. sooooooo gooooooood. Came here 3 times today. And I'm probably coming back for more.. I really love the beef noodle soup here. The soup base is very tasty with red peppers in it. I had to pick out all of the red peppers because my lips were burning and mouth was on fire from every single bite. 

What I didn't like was that we didn't even order tea, but they brought it for the table and charged each person for a cup. The sad part was that not everyone even touched their tea cups. What an easy way to make money huh?

Overall, I was impressed with the beef noodle soup. I usually don't eat a lot, but I was able to finish the whole bowl. I feel like the portion was too small because it is really expensive for a bowl of noodles. Oh well, everything is expensive on the strip I feel. 

Craving the noodles right now... =(. Friendly, quick service, quirky vibe, cute, unique spot for a drink, and good wine and beer selection. It is a small spot, so it can get a little crowded, but nice later happy hour.. I was here for liquid indulgences and Crudo did not disappoint!!! Also little did I know my bartender was the owner!  He made me an absolutely lovely Clover Club with hearts in the 'froth', so beautiful!  It was almost so pretty I didn't want to drink it, but alas I was thirsty ;) I have not eaten at Crudo for the record...I did see some amazing looking food pass by though!  I will be back for more amazing cocktails, service and I definitely need to try the food...If it is anything like Crudo beverages I am sure it will be spectacular!!. EVERYTHING I have tasted here is amazing. This is our alternative to Raku when hosting friends in town or celebrating something special.  Even though the portions are very small, the taste is an explosion in your mouth. They offer a special happy hour menu ($5-$12). I am not sure what time it starts but it ends at 6pm. 

PROS: Very beautiful modern cuisine
             Quiet and beautiful interior
             Crunchy Calamari
             Happy hour menu available
             
CONS: Expensive for a group of people to get full $$$
             Small portions (but I understand it's artistic so. . . ). *SWOON* 

My second Thomas Keller restaurant. After we were tired of the buffets, we decided to try Bouchon for dinner. What amazing dining experience. Our waiter was funny and really knowledgeable about the food and wine ("Wine is complex and unique, like women" extra tip!)

We started with the oysters which were as sweet as fresh Hog Island sweet waters. Then, I had the french onion soup which was to die for--gooey cheese and cooked slowly for just the right amount of time so the soup wasn't too salty. 

One hiccup during my dinner was ordering the fish. Oi. I don't know if this is how French fish usually is, but my fish was a little undercooked. I'm sure Nemo was ready to jump up and start singing. It was clear that I had not touched the fish at all and the waiter noticed. He asked if anything was wrong and I mentioned that the fish was a little undercooked for my taste and that maybe it just needed a little soy sauce (joke- I'm Chinese. I love steamed fish with ginger and soy sauce). He laughed and called over the GM who apologized and said that I would not be charged for my entree. 

No worries though because that left plenty of room for dessert. Our table basically ordered the entire dessert menu. Of particular note was the vanilla bean creme brulee. What a lovely dessert. It had clean notes and did not taste too heavy. 

Overall, really wonderful. I'll be back one day!. Vegetarians rejoice! They have a vegetarian sliced turkey sandwich, and amazingly enough it taste good! The rolls are delicious, the meats, cheeses, and toppings are always fresh, Capriotti's is one of my favorite sandwich shops.

Note to vegetarians: they also have a veggie cole turkey sandwich, a veggie philly cheese steak sandwich, and a veggie cheeseburger sandwich. YES! Choices in food, finally!!. I love this clinic. They are a bit hard to get to, but worth it. I've only seen Dr. Yocham with my two dogs and he's been very professional and friendly. My dogs love him, he's very no nonsense and doesn't try to tack on a lot of extras that may not be necessary. He offers his opinion and lets you decide without pressure what course of action to take. I trust his judgement and I appreciate that he doesn't make you feel like a bad owner. 

They do not take appointments, but like the others said, I usually get into a room within a few minutes, and only wait about 10 once in there for the Doctor or the Tech to come in. 

The ladies at the Admin counter are very friendly too. One was very helpful and worked up an estimate and walked me through all of it when I was concerned with dental costs. 

Overall I would recommend this place and Dr. Yocham. It's not fancy, but really who needs a fancy vet? All you get is a fancy price tag if you're concerned about all the frills that some offer.. So I love the concept, like the atmosphere, and like the food. (My favs are the curry chicken salad sandwich, the BBQ chicken pizza, the onion rings and the sweet potato fries)  However there are 2 things that keep me from giving Joe's 5 stars:  the prices and the huge lines.  Considering they grow all their own produce, the prices could be a tad cheaper.  But what bothers me more is the lines.  Ever since Joe's Farm Grill has opened, there has been lines, and I am sorry, but this problem should have been solved by now.  Open 2 windows on the weekends, hire more cooks, do SOMETHING, but NO food is worth waiting over an hour just to order.  Long lines may be a boost to the ego, but not really good customer service.  If Joe's could solve this issue, I would visit much more often, because I really do commend them for doing something unique.. Only have been here once but they have so many choices!! The ferrero rocher was to die for! Tasted exactly like the chocolates! I will def be back soon!. You know that place where you get an itch to stop by at random times of the day. This is it.
I am not addicted to it, but it does my body good.
Well priced compared to some other Philly's in the area. Worth a drive by and pick up!. My husband and I both have been going to Dr. Peter Balle for years. Close to our downtown home, in a clean and comfortable setting. The office staff seems to take customer service quite seriously. We always find that Nicole and Cindy follow through. My spouse has a very hard time with dentists and Dr. Balle makes sure he is comfortable, even if it's just a cleaning! Most important of all is that I never feel just I'm just a number in that office. I know my care is as important to them as it is to me.. Good place to catch a game.  Nice atmosphere, beer specials,  good service and tasty food.  
Carnivore Pizza Roll is yummy and filing.  Favorite wing sauce is Teriyaki (I like to order them crispy). Super fun trendy vibe!!! Everything we had was so good!! Get the sliders to start off and get the bringing sexy back cocktail! If you are staying at the Wynn/Encore must check out!. One of the best tapas sushi place ever.
Every dish has it own delicious flavor, generous portion and everyone is very nice.    Will definitely come back every time we're in Vegas :-). Yummy pizza and great service! I will return !!!. Love this place to work on my laptop, great drink selection, nice menu and very affordable, nice staff too! I love it when they have live music!. Great place! I've been coming here for quite some time now and every time I received excellent customer service. The servers are always friendly and attentive.

I LOVE the sushi there. They have a lot of fun, new rolls that are unique to Bamboo Grille. The spicy sauce they put on the rolls gives them a great kick too.

Recently I've noticed that the place has looked a little unfinished with random stuff here and there. Baffled, I asked a server and was informed that they are in the process of remodeling. Needless to say I'm excited for the newly designed Bamboo Grille!. I've been taking my dog, Roxy, for doggie daycare one or two days a week while I work.  She is like a different dog!  She loves playing and running out her energy and she is so much happier at home after playing all day.  The staff have always been very nice and professional.  It's a little bit pricey but a great place to go.. Mother Brunch is gem! 

When I walked into the place I was immediately greeted by the staff and took a seat at the bar. One of the waiters came by and asked what I would like to have, which led into a conversation on how they brew their beers, and the science behind it. After I ate I was even given a tour of the brewing station in the back and learned all about what goes into actually making a beer from start to finish. I have never had a brewery offer that. This really is a one of a kind place.

I ordered the sweet potato and black bean burger and they were kind enough to substitute the bun for a lettuce wrap.  I also upgraded the fries to the mac and cheese or "Beer Mac" I must say, though it was my my favorite, it is on the list of top 5 favorite mac and cheese in the state. 

My friend ordered their steak special with veggies and mash potatoes. I had a bite and the steak was tender and cooked with a nice flavor. The mashed potatoes though, that was INCREDIBLE. So creamy and with fresh chives on top. I secretly wanted to steal a bite every time he looked away.

Later the owner came by and stopped to talk with us. She is so friendly and really down to earth. During our conversation it was apparent that she loved what she did and had spoke with such passion about her staff and what it took to open the place. She was what every brewery owner should be. 

I will be back!. Yesterday afternoon, I started having a pretty good toothache.  By evening, I was in severe pain - nothing was helping.  Needless to say that I did not get any rest.  My dentist closes on Friday.  I called his cell phone (for emergencies) but was unable to reach him.  I started looking up area dentists, found the number and I called Boca Park Dental. I spoke with Amy who was very nice and understanding.  I was told to come in and they would try to work me in, despite their full load and my time restraints.  Before I had completed all of my paperwork, Dr. Turner saw me in the waiting room and whisked me back to numb my mouth (after asking pertinent questions about the toothache and my medical history) because I was shaking and crying.  I was in and out of here in under an hour!!!  Now, I am happy to say that I will become their regular patient, and not just for emergency use as I did today.. This location worked out well for me.  After finding out that Fremont Medical Center could not accommodate me again, I swung by here figuring I would just leave if it was a nightmare.  I was surprised by the very pleasant experience.  Everyone was so nice and upbeat.  Even when you feel like crap, it's hard not be grumpy when everyone who works there is smiling and happy.  In and out in less than 1 hour with a prescription for the drugs I needed.  This was 8am on a Thursday, mind you, but I've never experienced such quick turnaround at any clinic at any time of day in Las Vegas.  This is my new go-to place.

Note, they won't take same-day appointments for primary care - for new patients, at least.  You have to go to urgent care, which is a bit of a bummer but it all worked out in this case.  Yay!. The worst thing about this place is that we didn't get to stay longer.  Beautifully renovated, friendly staff, ample and delicious breakfast.  The owner was friendly and very helpful.  Walking distance to many downtown locations, and the light rail.. You can get the breakfast buffet or order off their menu. They have scrambled eggs, sausages, ham, hash browns, fresh fruit, cereal, unlimited orange juice, milk, oatmeal, bagels w/cream cheese... your choice in many different breakfast foods but it's all normal.

They have non-alcoholic pretty drinks for the morning if you don't feel like drinking alllllllll day :) 

Love the sweet breakfast dishes especially while the savory ones are just okay. It can get a bit busy but at the most, you'll wait about 15 minutes to get seated. Most of the time you'll be seated upon arrival. The atmosphere is very dim (probably for the hungover people)... Service is usually pretty good although it is a rather large restaurant so it gets a bit hectic. The coffee is amazing. Maybe because it's Italian and we're by the "venetian" =P. Very yummy!!
Came in tonight around 6-6:30pm for a casual dinner. I love the style here - tapas/shareable portions of creative and delicious food! We ordered the short rib gnocchi, shrimp risotto, French fries and a date and artichoke wood fired pizza with jalapeño peppers. Honestly, Everything was amazing. Food came out within 10 minutes, service was excellent, and they got us in right away even in the busy CES convention craziness. The pizza and short rib were my absolute favorite.. This is an amazing after dinner treat...I love going to Kokomo and building my own delicious treat.  The toppings are all fresh.  And the place is super clean.. Please just be prepared to wait. 99% of the time they only have 1 cashier in the morning and you will be waiting in line. 


Staff is super duper diddly friendly.The store is very organized.. It was AMAZING!! I really enjoyed it, it is a beautiful theatre, just nothing really around it. Lots of opportunity over there for development and growth it looks like. 

The leads, Glenda and Elphababa were really great.  It was long, I didn't home until 11:00 and I was tired but overall it was so awesome. The costumes, the singing,  the theatrics, overall a lovely night. We grabbed something to eat at Mundo over in the World Market Center, it was good and then walked over to the theater. 

I definitely recommend going to a show there, I want to see the nutcracker possibly in Dec. Oh it's easy to get in and out of there too, not too much traffic. Overall A+!!. Came here last night, and was pleasantly surprised first of all by the tucked away entrance. Very unassuming and welcoming, clean and bright. We were seated at a nice table where to my delight, there was no TVs, no loud groups of bachelorette parties, just a great ambiance to enjoy hopefully a great meal. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the food, the cocktail creations are well balanced. I liked how the menu was presented, with the course options. We decided to go for the $35 per person for 3 courses and decided to add two antipasti and a dessert after. The pig ears in the antipasti section and the smoked olives were really the highlight of my night. The pig ears are a MUST. We had the albacore and the ahi crudos, which were both stellar, then the semolina gnocchi, the burrata, the egg and caviar special, the brasato (which was a little on the dry side), and for dessert, the weird tiramisu something that was nowhere near a tiramisu. All in all, it started out so strong, but the last course (the brasato and the gnocchi) kinda let us down a little, and then the dessert was quite pathetic. They offered to replace with something else, which we didn't do, but it was nice to offer. Service was perfect, ambiance top notch, and because the  pig ears and the albacore crudo were so good, I will definitely be back.. I have been here for girlfriends birthday party, been here on date night, and out with group of couples - fun EVERY time!!!!  Food and atmosphere are amazing.  Only thing we noticed is that service was really poor - they actually took my water glass away mid meal and I wasn't drinking anything else!  We didn't care because we had so much fun with our friends but still.....  Also, happy hour half price drinks were ALL ice.  My husband had a Moscow Mule and very different drink during vs after happy hour.   I still LOVE the lollipop rolls and variety and will continue to go back.. What girl doesn't love a good blowout!
Blowout Dollhouse is a great addition to the Summerlin area! I've had two blowouts now and both have been a great experience with two different girls. And the place is super cute, very unique design. It can be a bit hard to find however. It took me 20 minutes to find the first time I was there. To save you time, it's located just above Brio, in the area they call the Market. 

I never just leave with a blowout, I love my curls! It's the only time I can actually hold any curls. (and lasts at least 2 days). A blowout is only $35, add $10 for a hot iron style. Totally worth it if you're a busy woman on the go or need something for a night out. They take appointments and walk-ins. 
Ask for Latoya the owner, she will take care of you!!!. My best friend and I came to Montreal for a long weekend with hopes of trying every kind of cuisine the city could offer. We stumbled across Juliette & Chocolat on our first night and made sure to return before leaving town.

Upon entering, you are immediately smacked across the face with the rich, warm, welcoming smell of good chocolate. The shop is clean and well lit with defined areas for dining in, having a quick coffee, or purchasing items from the bakery case.

On our first visit, my friend had the Juliette sampler, a plate with a bite of five different desserts. I ordered a Viennese coffee and the intense brownie. The coffee was delicious - hot and flavorful with an abundance of real whipped cream and a dark chocolate drizzle. The brownie... I can't even begin to describe the sinful richness. It was as if every taste bud had an orgasm.

On our other visit, my friend had the sundae and was quite satisfied. I initially intended to have the intense brownie again, but then I noticed something even better: the intense brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate ganache. It. Was. HEAVENLY. The brownie was warm, so the ice cream was melting into it. The ganache was perfectly rich without being cloyingly sweet. I would have licked my plate clean if I wasn't in public.

Overall, an extremely pleasant experience both times.. Oh man if you want good pizza come here! I've been here twice and im never disappointed. The pizza is amazing if you want a more expensive pizza (been eating $5 pizza forever forgot what real pizza taste like )other than pizza hut or domino pizza. The sauce is so good i dont know if it's homemade tomato sauce but it's perfect. The cheese,and meats are also very good. I've eaten once inside the restaurant and it was chill. Theres tv with sporta playing and it was clean. Love this place and any time I'm gonna spend money on a expensive pizza i will come here! And i only say expensive because im a college student.. I love Angels Trumpet.  
Really great space, cool vibe.  
Awesome beer selection, and amazing food.
The only complaint would be how loud it gets inside, sound just bounces around in that place, but what can you do?  Everything else is so great and I always have such a great time when I am here that after diving in to my beer flight I hardly even notice.. All of the ladies in this salon are amazing.  Get a facial/lashes from Kodi.  Get lashes by Ashely (the owner), she's awesome and so particular, which I love.  Get a mani pedi from their super sweet nail tech.  I'm a very, very picky person and they do an awesome job on every treatment, and are so accommodating to my busy schedule.  They call me when earlier openings are available and try to help minimize my time in the salon so I can back to my busy life.  Did you know they can do lashes, mani and pedis all at the same time, so you are in and out in 1.5 hrs!!  I suggest this salon to everyone-but especially busy moms and entrepreneurs that are always short on time.. Such a good breakfast place.  It's a small restaurant and can get kind of loud inside but it's definitely worth a try.  I had the truffle egg and bacon sandwich with some avocado.  Such a good hearty sand which with the breakfast potatoes on the side.  You can definitely taste the awesome truffle flavor .  Also the coffee is worth a try along with the cinnamon biscuits with fruit. Can't wait to try other things from their menu.  Staff was very friendly :).. Delicious food, great atmosphere, reasonably priced. Scallops with mushroom mashed potatoes were superb!!!. Maria's team is great.  Very thorough, friendly, and personable.  I would use them again and again.. I think I just found my new favorite morning place. Very friendly, plenty of seating, internet-friendly, and most of all a great French bakery. Wonderful flaky/buttery croissants, hearty croques madame, and even the basic ham and cheese sandwich is great. The croque monsieur/madame comes with salad and an excellent dijon mustard dressing that is NOT sweet! :)

I had a croissant at Starbucks the other day that was so dry I had to choke it down with half a bottle of water. I was so mad, that I decided to just not have another one unless it was from an authentic French bakery. Patisserie Manon is actually closer to me, but is apparently closed for several WEEKS, so La Belle Terre French Bakery & Cafe it is from now on.. Highly recommend! 
We have white carpets and with two dogs and a nine year old son, my carpets needed some love.  My husband and I were even considering replacing the carpet. So glad I called Care-Pro first! I am unbelievably happy with their work. I have like new carpets. My gorgeous white carpets have been brought back to life. Even the dingiest most high traffic areas look brand new. 
Quality work! Friendly employees!. This neighborhood gem has only recently caught my attention, and I am sorry I waited so long to try it for myself! I needed a food donation for a High School event I was helping with, and the owners here jumped in without a moments' hesitation! When I went to pick them up, they had bags and bags of bagels ready, and even added more to the piles before I could make it out the door. I must confess that I ate one on my way to the event venue and that bagel was one of the best I've EVER eaten! I appreciate this restaurant's generosity, community involvement, and the quality of their product. NY Bagel's 'N Bialys are on my list of breakfast spots to try this summer...see you there!. Hubby and I really enjoyed the show.  About 20 min before it started they had a few preformers out interacting with the audience.  There was story lines mixed in with dancing and about the middle of the show they started interacting with the audience where picked memebers became part of the transission to finish the show. I gave them 4 stars for two reasons - 1) they do not have fresh pasta and 2) my boyfriend's chicken Abruzzo was dry. The service was attentive and the bread was amazing. My Carbonara was incredible! The main dining room was a nice grotto style reminiscent of Rome; nice for couples and girlfriends catching up on life. I loved the Montpluciano in a carafe, but don't miss the extensive Italian wine list. We will definitely return to this Carnegie gem!. Funky chic!!!

This was the first time I have stayed at a Vegas hotel other than the Encore.  I was not disappointed, however, Encore is still my fav!!!  Sorry to admit that on The Cosmo's review, but it's the truth...plus...I still give The Cosmo 4 stars!!!

I have no real complaints about this hotel.  The staff is great, bartenders AWESOME (Tim at the Chandelier Bar!!!), rooms are large and nice, customer service good, food is decent, and plenty to do within the hotel itself.

The check-in process is quick and efficient, however, the staff at the front are not overly friendly.  They do their job, but that is about it.  Not a negative, but just expected  a little more convo and smiles.  However, Ali at the front desk is top notch...he provides the type of customer service I expect!!!  The rooms are quite large and funky.  The shower/tub area is ginormous and a huge plus.  However, shower/tub area is so large that it is freezing in there unless you are actually standing under the water.  So...didn't really get to fully use the tub area.  The vanity/sink top is a bit small for 2 people with lots of product, but not a big deal.  Other than that, the room is fab.  House keeping is very good at keeping up with messy peeps (my husBAND), but we did have 1 strange encounter with them.  My husBAND and a friend went up to the room 1 night to drop some stuff off and when they opened the door there was a lady in there.  My husBAND assumed he was in the wrong room as the lady just looked at them and didn't say a word.  He went back to the elevator and retraced his steps and ended up back at the same door.  This time he knocked and the maid opened the door and simply asked "May I help you?".  She just gave my husBAND the vibe that this was her room and not that she was cleaning it.  He finally got into the room, but just left feeling weird about her being in the room.

We tried many of the bars and restaurants at The Cosmo and loved them all.  The room service food is a big miss, however.  Very bland and overly priced, but what room service isn't?

The main floor of the Cosmo is predominately non carpeted and very busy.  Someone had spilled their drink and my husBAND slipped and fell.  There were many employees around, but not one stopped to ask if he was okay or to find out what happened.  I guess they assumed he was drunk.  We had to go over to security and tell them that they might want to clean the spill up so someone doesn't get hurt.  This example is my only real gripe about The Cosmo.  While they provide good customer service when you ask for it, they are not very perceptive about someone needing customer service.

Oh...one more gripe.  We had booked our room on our debit card and given our credit card at check in.  When we left, our charges were charged to our debit card.  We called and were told that this is because this is the card we used to book and if we wanted to use a different card for charges we would have had to give the other card at check in.  WE DID!!!  Very strange, but whatevs.

Overall a fantastic hotel and I would definitely suggest it to anyone visiting Vegas.  However, I do think the Encore has The Cosmo beat in all aspects so I will no longer be cheating on the Encore.  Wait...The Cosmo does have a better location than the Encore.  It is right near the heart of the strip and you can easily walk to everything.  With the Encore, you have to cab it everywhere.  That is a HUGE plus, but still sticking with the Encore!!!. We celebrated an anniversary there and it was so nice to be out of the confines of a large hotel and in a real restaurant that focuses on service and high quality food, instead of serving people as fast as possible to get them out the door. This is a wonderful restaurant and the Manager came to the table and made some excellent recommendations. I can't wait to go back for the lobster mac and cheese!  The dry aged ribeye was the best I have ever had.. First off, I want to start by saying that I have tried EVERYTHING to get myself more into weight training. I have no problem being on an elliptical for an hour, taking a zumba class, or running on a treadmill... but I can never get myself to actually take the time to "tone" my body and get muscle definition. This is the first time since I have been working out (7 years) that I can legitimately say that I have found a workout obsession. I signed up for the $100 new student special... and I will write you all a little something about my experience here: *if you stop reading here... all I have to say is SIGN UP... you truly won't regret it. It is the BEST thing I've ever done for my body*

My first class was Karve Basics with Alyssa. It was intense, hard, and my legs were shaking about 10 minutes in... I was even fatigued during the beginning marches! However, her energy and attitude made me want to keep pushing myself... along with her positive reinforcement "Good Job Kim! There you got it!"... as I felt like I couldn't go on anymore. After that class, the next day I could hardly move, and I was sore for about 4 days (no joke) ..even though I workout 5-7 times a week with cardio and zumba. The second class I took was again with Alyssa, but it was a regular Karve class. I would recommend the Karve Basics to anyone starting out, because it is smaller and the instructor really pays attention to the new students' form - but the regular Karve class was just as hard on my body. After my second class, I was sore for about 2 days. The third and fourth class were with Tara and Debbie, both great teachers, and both VERY tough! Tara took the time during class to correct my form in some of the exercises, and Debbie took about 10 minutes after class to work with me and 2 others to help us get the correct form. I can honestly say that after these 4 classes, taken over 8 days, I had the definition in my abs and the outline of a 6 pack. This was astonishing to me...but then I got the flu and had to take a week break :-(

However, besides my first class, the one that stands out to me the most was the class that I took last night with Gina. After reading these boards, I was honestly scared to take a class with her. I had read over and over again how hard it is and how she is like a drill sergeant and how people starting out were so frightened that they didn't come back... So when I had to go to a later class yesterday, and I realized that it was Gina teaching, I was very nervous. From the very beginning of class, I was astonished at the choreographed words that she spoke (I truly don't think she stopped talking, which was great and made you concentrate on what she was saying rather than the fact that your leg was about to fall off) and constantly changing exercises. She made me want to push myself harder - and it was definitely the best workout that I have gotten there so far. I would compare her to Jillian Michaels from The Biggest Loser (probably because it's one of my favorite shows) - she's stern, she definitely knows what she is doing, and it seems like she has been teaching classes for her whole life (even though she is/looks young!). Needless to say, I will definitely be attending her classes whenever I can, because I am the type of person that likes and needs to be pushed beyond my limit.

ANYWAYS - now that I've gone on and on about my experience... I have not had Kendra, Danielle, or Alli as a teacher - but they all already have rave reviews on here.

THANKS KARVE for starting me AND keeping me on track to get that 6 pack!!!. This is our favorite place for dinner now.  The best thing is being able to call ahead to be put on the wait list, by the time you drive there you can get seated almost right away, while others sit and wait.  Excellent food, good service, great pricing for what you get ;). Had an awesome time! My first time on an Atv and I felt safe with Safaks's directions and instructions. Highly recommended!. Just had amazing service at Mercedes Benz of North Lake. I got a huge nail in my tire and they replaced it for free since I just bought my car about a month or so ago. Since they didn't currently have one in stock, they took one off of a brand new car they had for sale! That's what I call service! Thanks Nick Collins! And thanks to Garret, a mechanic, who gave my 4 year old grandson a tour of the repair shop and what it looks like under a car including the engine. They have a great waiting area with wonderful snacks. My car buying experience was terrific too! Thanks Yanuche (sp?). They even have a concierge to show you the features of the car and answer any questions at purchase and later. Great experience so far all around Mercedes at North Lake!. My favourite Restaurant in Montreal. Jamais  déçu par la qualité du service malgré qu'il est toujours bien occupé. Tous les plats que j'ai gouter sont délicieux, généreux et toujours avec une tres belle présentation.. Great for a date night or family fun, go see a game with the 51s!
I knew we had a minor league baseball team, but I didn't know anything about them until I was given free tickets for a game- the stadium is small but all seats have a great view, and if you purchase tickets in advance they're really cheap. The entertainment between innings is limited but family-friendly- try to snap a photo with Comet, the alien mascot!

Parking is $4 or free with a season pass. Dining options are priced comparable to any other sports venue ($4 hotdogs, $5 nachos, $7 beers, etc) but selection is better than expected: popcorn, crackerjacks, burgers, snow cones, and Dippin Dots ice cream.  

Special shoutout to seats A1 and A2 in section 8- phenomenal view, face value of $9 when purchased in advance. Can't beat that!. Little Chicago is our go-to delivery pizza in our neighborhood.  We used to live upstairs from an awesome pizza joint in Boston and I was disappointed when we moved into our south Scottsdale neighborhood that there weren't any good pizza places close by or that delivered, but then we found Little Chicago.  Their pizza is thin crust (my fave) and has just the right amount of sauce, toppings, etc.  Their wings are good too and always have just the right amount of sauce and heat.  If it's Friday night and we don't want to cook or we're having people over and want to have pizza, Little Chicago gets our business every time :)  They are very prompt with delivery and their drivers are always friendly.. I stopped here out of shear hunger and had time to kill. They  just had there grand opening the day before I got there. I walked in and the smell of the fresh breads were mind boggling. This place is very tiny and very cheerfully decorated and clean! The ladies behind the counter were still learning the tricks of the trade. Very sweetly greeted me and asked me what I like to order. They have about 10 different sandwiches posted on a very nice menu board and huge options for coffee and all the breads, cakes, pies, tarts, OMG Drool! They will make you any kind of sandwich and hand you more samples than you can shake a stick at. I order the turkey and had it on a fresh baked croisant. Too yummy to explain. The green tea was fresh brewed and out of this world. If you go remember they are as fast as Subway but they will knock your socks off!. Friendly service. The bul-go-gi is very good! Shrimp Yakisoba as well. (I don't do spicy dishes). The side dishes that come with it are hit and miss, mostly hits though.. This is my go-to neighborhood bar. The bartenders are friendly, the beer is cold, the food is well above average, and the vibe / atmosphere works. Plus, there are plenty of TVs, pool, and Big Buck Hunter. It basically satisfies all of my typical bar needs.. BEST teriyaki bowl EVER!!!! From the taste and food quality to the decor and atmosphere this location is the best location! 

The taste and quality has always been the same, that is hard to find at other restaurants. The employees are so delightful, happy, cheerful and welcoming. Not many places have such happy people working. 

The price is fair, I usually cannot finish my teriyaki bowl so I end up with left overs. I think 2 meals for under $10 is a pretty decent. They don't charge for extra sauces either, that is rare and very appreciated. 

If you want a quick, healthy, fairly priced meal. Stop by teriyaki madness!! I guarantee you will not be disappointed in anything that you try. 

Parking can be challenging to some.... It doesn't hurt to walk a little. Especially after indulging in some incredible food.. I enjoyed my experience at Bonefish for the most part. I felt like the service was a tad slow, but not bad. We ordered the lobster chowder to start. It was good. Although, I  wish it would have come with a crusty piece of bread. We also had the bang bang shrimp which was great. Prices were comparable to other similar chains. I'd go back again.. Himal Chuli is the sister restaurant to Chuatara and also happens to be the better one IMO. I don't know how traditional/authentic it is, but the food is light, tasty, and flavorful, and as a massive meat eater, I can say that they have some of the best vegetarian food I've ever eaten (most places are just too bland or funky).

Surprisingly enough, for a restaurant with such a strong vegetarian emphasis, they do have good meat dishes. My biggest issue with this place is the price -- they seriously could charge a little less... $9 for the amount of food served was hardly a bargain and $15 for the meat stuff? Ouch. 

Atmosphere is cosy and quaint -- It's kinda quiet and bright and you get a nice view of State Street when you're sitting there.. The pastries are SO good here.  The vibe is comfy.   Did I mention the pastries?  SO good.. My all time favorite Italian restaurant!  A must have is Rigatoni D.  A few other recommendations are four cheese ravioli, beef medallions and the spinach and artichoke dip.  Beautiful restaurant and very busy.  Make reservations on a weekend.. I've had consistently good stuff here. Frankly, I usually shun "Mexican" places that are anything but traditional, and consider "southwestern" style as death knell for my tastebuds... but Sierra Bonita has overcome all that. Items I really like are the guacamole (very chunky avocado), fish tacos, bacon wrapped beef (they had achieved the elusive goal of getting the bacon crispy without overcooking the shrimp), the pork lion enchiladas (offered sometimes as specials) and burgers. No culinary breakthroughs here, but always pleasing. 

My colleague commented that his pork enchiladas were $11, came with no sides, and still left him hungry. While I think prices are reasonable for the quality, those with a large appetite may be looking at $15.00 or more for a meal.. seriously the best in town..i am so happy i went to them to get my tint & i will definitely be back no doubt! dan & james are so awesome funny & very personable & very professional! i love that all their products are made in the usa as well, so you know right away youre getting the best of the best products! they also offer a guarantee on all their work...which 95% of places do not! they got my tint done quick & it looks fabulous i couldnt be happier! this is now my go to place & they do more than just tint!!!! i will for sure be sending any & everyone!!! thank you time 2 tint you guys rock!!!!. Red Lobster can easily be written off as just another big chain restaurant.  But, really it is one of the more affordable options to get seafood that still tastes delicious.  I'll admit- I'm not the biggest fan of our friends in the sea.  But, I can handle a little shrimp and lobster occasionally. 

This location is BUSY every time I visit.  Wait times for a Friday or Saturday night are generally estimated to be 40-45 minutes.  But, really, we have only every waited 20 minutes tops which leads me to believe that they are estimating high so guests don't get angry.

Since this is a chain that most people are familiar with, I will focus on the service aspect of this location.  On our most recent trip, we were blown away by the awesomeness of our server.  He seemed to be balancing many tables at once, including a large party of about 10.  Yet, our drinks were always full and he checked in to see how we were doing multiple nights.  Sometimes this does not even happen at high end restaurants! 

Although I hate the crowded waiting area of Red Lobster, I do enjoy visiting this location because we have never been treated poorly and the food is always great.. Great service! Great food! Love the AZ Burro! I love going places where the staff is so friendly and welcoming.. Here's why Fez works for me.  I'm a "Let's try something new!" kind of a person and my girlfriend is a "Do they have cheeseburgers?" kind of gal.  Only a generality of course, but that's often the way it goes.  So, a place that has some fun food AND is known for having decent burgers gets major points in my household.  

And their pomegranate martini's?  After all the reviews I figured I'd try one.  Oh my goodness.  I wanted to get a whole pitcher!  I kept picturing the happy faced Kool-Aid guy filled up with this yumminess saying "Oh yea....".   SO good!  I'm already psyched to go back to get one again.  

The food is good.  She loved her All-American Burger and my thing, forget what they call it, but I like to think of it as Spinach Gyro Flatbread Pizza, was pretty good too.  I don't remember which appetizer we got (I blame the drink) but it was really good.  

This is a SMALL location for all the buzz this place is getting.  On a Thursday we had a 20 minute wait, and the couple in front of us waited about 25.  It's a different kind of a place for Downtown Phoenix, which is great.  It's not quite all that and a bag of chips, but it's all that.. Exceptional service! 
Valet...fast and courteous. Self Parking is a nightmare because of where it's located. If you self park you've got to walk a through the Mile of Shops to get to the front desk. I would HIGHLY recommend the valet parking. If traveling with someone in need of handicap parking, valet is your only option.  
Check in...a front desk attendant with a personality, smiles and great conversation. Gave us an upgrade to a bigger room and a nice view of the strip :)
Restaurants...overpriced as you would expect but the service made up for it. Very attentive waitstaff at every eating establishment we encountered
Concert venue....an awfully long line that led around the Mile of Shops. They need to open their doors sooner to give that long single line of people a chance to get to their seats. When you arrive 30 minutes early to a show you would expect to see the whole show but because we waited in that entrance line for about an hour, we missed part of the opening act. However, service was exceptional here. When my friend needed assistance in the steep climb out of the venue, security didnt rush us out. They told us to take all the time we needed and one even offered his arm to her and assisted her out at her pace, not his.

Planet Hollywood Hotel is a great example of how customer service should be!. I was in Vegas for the last week of April on vacation and we decided to eat at Mon Ami Gabi for my girlfriend's birthday dinner. We had reservations for 9pm but then realized we'd be best off walking to the restaurant (from the Mirage) which would take a bit of time so I bumped it back to 9:30. Wouldn't you know we arrived a few minutes after 9pm afterall! The restaurant was PACKED with a line for people without reservations and a line for people with reservations. Luckily we had reservations and although early, we were seated right away. 

We were hoping for a seat on the outside patio area but that would have added a 45 minute wait so we ended up in a covered area between the inside and outside. The doors to the patio were open so we had a clear view into the night and a pretty awesome view of the Bellagio fountains across the street!

Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal. The bread they brought with butter was delicious. Hard to stop eating but I had to because I'd ordered a soup appetizer. I went with the creamy mushroom soup. If you like mushrooms you'll definitely enjoy this soup! And how could I resist dipping some bread into it? I couldn't. But I will say that the soup was so delicious, I preferred the soup solo without the added heaviness of the bread. 

I ordered the hangar steak with frites, med rare. My friend (she ordered a different cut) also ordered steak and frites but her steak was unevenly cooked. She still enjoyed and at it all! But did want to share that. My steak on the other hand was perfectly cooked. She wasn't crazy about the frites (too crunchy) but I loved them! I couldn't stop munching away on them even after feeling FULL! 

Our waiter was extremely attentive without being obnoxious, the third person in our group sneakily told the waiter it was my friend's birthday and they brought her out a dessert. I'm not sure what it was exactly but we all ate from it and really enjoyed it! It was delicious! Ok looked up the menu. It must have been profiteroles. Yummy!

Good food, great service, excellent experience, and enough variety on the menu that if you're on a budget you can eat well without breaking the bank. If I ever return to Las Vegas, I will absolutely look to return to Mon Ami Gabi.. Kauai pie. I canceled my other pest control service after I caught him not even spraying the back yard, which is why we had a pest control service, but he left me a bill and did not mention that he left without completing the job. No problem like that with Charley and Green Ninja Pest Control. I haven't even see a bug yet. He is so through and trust worthy. We will never use any one but Green Ninja. Janet T. Wow!!! The sirloin sliders were amazing!!! I am in severe shock. Last time we had ate here which was at least a year ago was nothing short of decent as far as food goes. But it seems as though the menu has changed dramatically has shortened in length which I'm okay with. Those sliders with the horse radish sauce onion strings and aus jus were so good that if you think that you dislike horseradish now will bring you into a new light you never saw coming. 

I have also tried their jambalaya rolls that are probably tied for 1st place but probably a smidgen below first which is the sirloin sliders of how good these things are as well. And mind you, I had not been drinking heavily to impair my senses and taste buds believe me I'm usually dd on a normal basis and I'm sober probably 90% of the year. 

The calamari was pretty good as well but I haven't ordered a basket to myself to see if I could down more than a handful and not get sick of it so still have to wait til I give that more time to sink in. The fish tacos were the only thing I was kinda disgusted by there was a really weird taste goin on and could not tell if it was the vegetables or the fish. One of the two just tasted off and not right. Definitely will not order that again. Kind of the lesson I learn for not sticking to the sliders. 

Those sliders are just mouth wateringly delicious to make you want to eat them all the time.. Dinner tonight was good. I had a Caesar salad that was great. It had a lot of shaved Parmesan cheese on it. The croutons were homemade. I ordered 4 cheese ravioli with sauteed mushrooms. It was fantastic. The only problem that we had was my son's order got messed up and they brought the wrong thing. They said they would get his order right out to him. Then they brought some macaroni and cheese, but he did not order that either. Then they brought him a pizza (he did order a pizza), but it was not the pizza that he ordered. Finally they brought him his pizza (after the rest of us had already finished our dinners). They did not even offer us a reduced bill because of it.. After months of planning a bachelorette party in Vegas, and booking with another agency we arrived in Sin City ready to party. Upon arrival at the airport, bags in hand we ventured to the designated pick up location only to find our bus had not arrived. I called the company and they gave me the runaround for the next 2 hours. At which time they admitted that our confirmed paid reservation had somehow been over looked. Bear in mind our entire trip hinged on that reservation including hotel. We called numerous taxi services to find we had far too many people. At the suggestion of another passenger, whose transportation did arrive, we made a call to Wild Boyz Entertainment. After explaining the situation to the booking agent, they were able to quickly book a party bus for us. As well as entertainment and hotel for the entire stay. They did not disappoint! The dancers were phenomenal! Kept everyone entertained and for not knowing what our personalities were or knowing exactly what we wanted, they nailed it! Thank you for an amazing experience! Will definitely use them again. They are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!. The ppl were friendly but I just felt my pedicure was rushed. It took 30 mins.  If I'm paying for a deluxe pedicure my time should be deluxe also not express.. I don't come here to eat much, I usually come for the beer cave. Best build-your-own six pack joint in the city!. Great service and equally great food. A little on the expensive side but worth it even just for the ambience! We just randomly stopped in while looking for a restaurant on st Denis and we definitely weren't disappointed.. This place is Great! My mom was diagnosed with lymphoma six years ago, she needed a  new clinic... Her doctor sent us here and we couldn't be happier! They called us and scheduled an appointment for her to see a lymphoma specialist! Dr. U is great! Super nice and very knowledgable! The facility is beautiful and their boutique of hope is wonderful too!. Love this place.  Great food...a cut above the average Mexican food.  Really nice courtyard for eating outside during good weather.  Good margaritas too.  I highly recommend it for those who've grown tired of the typical large or smaller chain Mexican restaurants.. Come on down into Grumpy's and laugh with the hilarious staff, find your corner amid the stone walls and listen to local talent sing, strum their guitars or rock out on a ukulele.  The beer is plentiful and the prices are reasonable. It's downtown but a bit tucked away, so it almost feels like your own special bar.. A friend and I were in the mood for Indian food last night for dinner, the place that I wanted to try happened to be closed due to storm damaged, still didn't want to give up on the idea of having Indian cuisine for dinner, she suggested Copper Kettle, which I have been meaning to try for awhile now. We went inside the restaurant and waited to be seated. I have to say service was excellent, never once did we have to ask for our drinks to be refilled and they were very attentive to our needs.  For starters we ordered  hummus & the tandoori naan basket, we picked Onion & Garlic, The Garlic Naan was crisp and garlic was not over powering but my favorite was the Onion Naan, it had sauté  diced onions layered in the center of the bread, so delicious both went well with their Mint Sauce! We ordered Pea Pulao, which was outstanding and very flavorful. Also ordered the Ginger Balti Chicken and Tikka Masala Chicken and on both dishes the chicken was tender and juicy, though the ginger chicken was great & full of flavor I just couldn't get enough of the Tikki Masala! Since it was my 1st time there I am definitely going back & will work my way through the menu!. By far the best pho I had here in Vegas. The oxtail pho is to die for! I will definitely come back!. While walking through Bellagio to catch the Tram, we noticed this amazing bakery.  The site is beautiful and it was packed with folks trying to get an sweet afternoon treat.  Everything looked amazing and there were so many options to choose from that it was really hard to pick just one dessert.  My friend settled on the creme brule' gelato and I went with the triple chocolate cheesecake.  She enjoyed her gelato.  My cheesecake was so beautiful that I did not want to cut into it.  The cheesecake was covered by a white chocolate shell.  Once you cut into it, the cheesecake was really soft and yummy.  The graham cracker crust was difficult to cut into while walking and eating at the same time, but it was really good.  Once it was done, there was a chocolate ball on top which was the perfect capper.  I wish I could have tried some of the other pastries or chocolates.  I will be back next time I am in Vegas.. A very cozy little place to sit and have a great lunch.  They have a pretty simple setup, so it doesn't look like anything fancy but they have a lot to offer.  

This place specializes in great deli style sandwiches.  Their sandwiches are really big and filling, and made with Boar's Head meat that's just so tasty.  They only use gourmet cheese as well, so you are sure find something good.  Their roast beef is the best I've had in a long time.  The service was really fast and friendly, and I had a great time.. Its a little hole in the wall but it is GOOD!! All you can eat its a good price and they have a good selection and great service. Totally recommend this place.. No one wants to pay for HVAC work but it is a lot easier when a professional like Lamar comes out to do it. He is very knowledgable and personable. My husband insisted I make sure Lamar was scheduled to do our yearly service and I can see why. He is a tremendous asset to your company and is the reason we continue to use MTB. You should try to clone him.. If its summer I'm at the Hard Rock.. From opening to closing of Rehab Season... And Since i'm pretty much living in a bikini all summer the only thing i eat all summer sad but true...lol...  I literally eat nothing but the Grilled Yellowfin Tuna Salad at Mr. Lucky's,  my friends all laugh at me but that's all I eat.. I live for this salad..  Its my fav salad I've ever had and I am not changing or venturing out.. This is it if its summer its my salad and if they ever take it off the menu I will hunt somebody down.... Copperhead crossfit is so welcoming, I highly recommend checking them out. I was traveling out of town during the crossfit open and was worried I would have a hard time finding a box that was easy to drop in. I spoke with Nathan over the phone and when I showed up for the WOD, everyone was inviting, excellent customer service! through the whole workout, members would have support and pushed you to work hard. Such a great experience, this is a must if you are looking for a place to get fit and stick with it!. This was the BEST!!!! Went last night with my girlfriends and our moms. The instructor was wonderful...everyone was laughing and having fun...oh! And we could drink wine the whole time! Best part is... Even if you're not that good at painting its OK! Every picture came out a little different but that was the cool part!  I can't wait to come back!. Dreaming of a delicious, fresh dinner on a romantic, candlelit outdoor patio?  This is the place for you.  I needed peace after a rough day at work and found this on Yelp. (Thanks to others for providing the photo of the patio.)  I adored the spinach appetizer.  The chef provided delicious, gratuitous roasted carrots with goat cheese that were wonderful.  The salmon dish was very good.  The accompanying salad had a special oak flavor that was wonderful.  I like oak in my wines, now I'll look for it in my salads.  BYOB and cash and you have yourself a special evening.. Went there for the first time and got one of their acai bowls. So delicious!!! One of the best ones I had. Great service, felt very welcomed and the place smells great!. I've given up finding the best pizza in town because, quite frankly, sometimes I'm in the mood for fold-it-in-half NY style pizza and other times I crave something more refined. Venezia's does NY style right, with a consistency that has yet to disappoint.

The menu offers a nice variety, touting the usual toppings and pizza variations (calzones, stromboli, etc.). Add to that tasty salads, wings, and sandwiches made with Boarshead meats.

Their combo specials make Venezia's an affordable lunch option. For the carnivores, go on Wednesdays to try out my personal favorite, the Italian Stallion. Otherwise, the Greek salad is also delicious. 

The fountain and tea offerings are abundant. TVs are tuned in to sports channels. The staff is friendly and the seating is generous:  booths and tables with a handful of larger booths for parties of 4+. Lunch is busy, but I've never found myself without a place to sit. Venezia's is situated in a strip mall with limited seating outside and plenty of parking.. My first visit wasn't so great because my steak was some what fatty but the dessert was awesome.  However, my first visit was when they just opened so  I tried it a second time and it was much better.  I definitely recommend this place for a business dinner or a night out with friends.. I would highly recommend this veterinary office. The staff, and in particular, Tamara (?), are very friendly, concerned and caring. Dr. Bartz is awesome. No upsetting, just facts, worst case scenario and what we could get by with on this particular visit. We felt that they really understood and cared about our concerns for our kitty, Oliver. They spent a lot of time explain everything. We left there feeling that they value their customers and really care about others' pets!. We like this place as a standard sushi restaurant in Squirrel Hill.  It's close to home, and the prices are pretty even-keel with other sushi places in the Pittsburgh area, and you can also get takeout.

The sushi is great, however, there are really not a lot of selection on special or unique rolls.  If we could do half-stars, I'd give it a 3.5, but I'll round up because they consistently make your typical sushi rolls quite well.

On our latest visit, we had a great waiter who was prompt with delivery of the food, and he also would refill our hot tea, but we had a really hard time getting refills on our water.  Unfortunately, with the saltiness of sushi and soy sauce, we kind of needed frequent refills on that, so I felt like I chugged a gallon of water right when I got home.

We tried something new this time, which was the 'first date roll,' a shrimp tempura roll with spicy tuna on top.  We loved this one, as it was a good example of something unique they can do.  The miso soup was also top-notch.

I would recommend this place if you're looking for good, standard-issue sushi.  We typically prefer Pacific Ring in Squirrel Hill, because they've made a lot of unique (and Pittsburgh-themed) rolls to spice things up, but this is a good second place.

I'm also a big fan of the wavy cups they serve your hot tea in, and they do have a wine list, although we have yet to try it out.. First time here and let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised. The food was amazing. We had the buffalo chicken sandwich with a side of bacon mashed potatoes and the kale quinoa salad with chicken. Both amazing! I'll be back for ur chicken sandwich for sure. Taylor was our server and was a delight! Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the bottomless mimosas. Don't waste your money. The first one is delicious and the rest taste like pure orange juice. Supposedly they do half orange juice half champagne (we just watched the bartender make a carafe and it was 25% champagne) Oh, and it's only until 2pm. That's not a mimosa in my book.. Great food, never had a bad meal there.  I love that they get their desserts from Signature Desserts.. I'll admit that I'm always a little wary when my bf suggests we get bbq for lunch or dinner. Part of that stems from the fact that so many bbq places focus on pork and your fave muzz over here can't eat dat piglet. The other part of my wariness stems from the number of meh bbq joints that we've been to that never make me feel like, "Damn I want to come back here!" 

After visiting my brother in Austin, TX and having (and loving) what was arguably some of the best bbq in the world, I now know that I am not the problem in this bbq relationship. I also have a confession: if good bbq brisket was a man, I'd marry him stat mcgat.  That's how much Texas changed my poor little naive bbq brain. 

Now I'm sure you're wondering, when the heck is this weird girl going to tell us about Naked BBQ? Patience, my dear friends, which is incidentally enough the quality you need most when smoking that tasty dry rubbed slab of meat that we all know and love. Naked BBQ is pretty much as close to Texas bbq as I'll get in the old southwest. The service was friendly and helpful and the prices were VERY reasonable for what you're getting. Obvi I was bummed that the beans had bacon in them, but the mac and cheese was so yummy that I forgot all bummed feelings immediately. 

I got the brisket and dayum was it tasty. The bark on the outside of the meat is nice and flavorful and crispy, without being too peppery. The meat itself is juicy and tender and falls apart very easily. I will say I got a particularly fatty part of brisket, which I only knew bc I compared my pieces to those of my bf's meal. That's a very minor thing though and obviously with bbq, sometimes it's the luck of the draw. 

Anyway...........naked bbq lived up to my expectations and I shall return for more! I'd go back now buuuuut you know, I don't want to die at 25 of heart failure due to consumption of massive amounts of animal fat.. Courtney is a multifaceted artist with a keen eye for perfection. She will enhance your natural beautiful features, as well as educate you about lash extension care along the way. She operates with honesty & integrity. You will receive the BEST lash care in Tempe. Trust Courtney with your lashes & beyond...you will not be disappointed!. We've only tried Phonecia once, but we'll definitely be back. We love love loved the cilantro hummus. The waiter challenged us to think of a better hummus, and we were stumped. I had the falafel and rice (both a little unimaginative but reliably good), and my husband had the gyro (huge and tasty). Service was great even though they were super busy. We'd recommend it as one of the only Greek places in Gilbert!. Arriving the day after their grand opening, I was not sure what to expect, but Gelato Messina really seems to have their act together.

The decor is beautiful. I can imagine this being much like a sleek coffee shop but for gelato -- which is much better, in my book. 

The gelato is truly authentic. The texture is incredibly creamy, and the flavors are strong. 

The pecan pie was a beautiful base with a bold roasted nut flavor. 
The chocolate with peanut was similar to taking a spoon full of incredibly light peanut butter that was cooled just perfectly. 
By far, the favorite was the special with duck fat caramel and potato chips. It had such a unique flavor, and I am amazed that the chips stayed crunchy. 

With Art of Flavors changing hands, this could very well become the new place for the best gelato in town.. The food was great and our server Perry was amazing! He will even help you with trivia. We enjoyed our meal, our service was excellent and most important to us our kids had a great time as well! The management was awesome when needed. Really have nothing but great things to say about dining in this establishment!. This is really a terrific restaurant. Great food, great service. Creative menu. Definitely recommend!. I must say that this place was a welcome respite from the sometimes overly ostentatious Vegas strip - it's not a pretty place, it's kind of corny, but it's a good time!  Just basic dance music playing on the outdoor stage, bartenders doing all sorts of crazy things with drinks, and lots of inebriated people just dancing and having a good time to the classic dance music from past years.  It's not necessarily hip, not jet set cool, but just a good time!. Having newly moved from Buffalo, I was looking for a place to replace my favourite, Jasmine. I think this is going to be my new Thai place. I judge all Thai places by their Pad Thai and this is some of the best Pad Thai I've had. It was a perfect sized portion, full of meat, and just the right amount of spice. A lot of the Pad Thai meat is just greasy peices of meat, but at this place, even the meat had flavour!! My friend got a curry dish and he loved it as well, The waitresses were super sweet and attentive as well, an added bonus.. First buffet at Vegas (that I can remember...) and it was pretty amazing!

There's a good variety of items here but not as much as I thought there would be. Some casino buffets in San Diego have more variety of items than here, but what they lack in variety, they excel in quality. 

There might be a ton of buffets out there that claim they have the most variety of items but the quality is horrendous! And when you take that into consideration, there's probably only a couple of things you can actually eat because everything else tastes like crap. 

Everything tastes AMAZING here at Wynn! Some of my favorites have to be the FLANK STEAK. OMG! BEST TASTING STEAK EVER!!! I couldn't stop eating it! They used really good quality foods for everything! The fruit they served had some of the best tasting pineapple I've ever had!! There's a really nice dessert section with a made to order crepe station!! For dinner there is also king crap legs that are sliced in half for you already!! You don't have to work for the meat, which makes it all the more enjoyable to eat!! 

I loved the presentation of all the food items. I tend to not eat salads at buffets but when Wynn arranges the salad in beautiful glass cups, I couldn't even resist eating some! 

Drinks are unlimited as well, so you can pick from coffee, tea, sodas, etc. 

I think lunch is around $24 and dinner is around $43 (tax included). 

The only reason I didn't give this place five stars is because: 1) Lacking in variety of items (as compared to other casino buffets); 2) No watermelon (my favorite fruit); 3) No macaroons (which I saw on other yelper's pictures); 4) Our waiter changed shifts and our second waiter was really neglectful of us

Overall: I would totally recommend this buffet! The quality of their foods here is top notch!. This is one of our favorite hotels in Las Vegas.  The suites are large and comfortable with everything we need and a nice view of the strip.  There are so many shopping and dining options in the Palazzo and it is connected to the Venetian which is my favorite poker room.  I like that it is close to the Fashion Show mall and other nice resorts.  I also love the Canyon Ranch Spa which is probably one of the best spas in town.. YES YES YES! I have a new found love for Tryst! 

Until I visited Tryst last weekend, my favorite place to be in Vegas was Tao. It probably still is. But let me just say that Tryst is running a close 2nd for sure! Beautiful decor, and above all else, we had a great experience here.

We got ourselves put on the guest list through their website (Please note: You must do this at least 7 days in advance and a promoter will text you with confirmation the day of). Also, THEY WILL NOT PUT A GUY'S NAME ON THE GUEST LIST! So make sure you register with one of the females in your party. Being on the guest list almost always saves you time waiting in line and reduces your cover, if you have to pay at all. 

The only bad thing I have to say about Tryst is that the line at the door seemed very unorganized. We arrived at the club around 11 pm, where there was one single file line for everyone, and you had to fight for the attention of the ONE worker with a clipboard to notify them that you had a table or were on guest list. Otherwise, you continue to wait with those who are general admission. We waited about 15 minutes in line before I FINALLY grabbed a worker's attention, and then we were walked right in and did not pay any cover charges (1 male, 1 female). OK, that made up for waiting in line! :)

When we got in, we made our way over to the bar and got drinks fairly quickly, and then were almost immediately drawn to the breathtaking waterfall, where we spent a few minutes taking pictures and warming up by the heaters. Beautiful place & it was just busy enough to be fun on a Friday night :) 

We got a few shots from the pretty girls walking around with them, and had such a blast! Also, they have a pole there that anyone can get up & dance on.. Lots of people took advantage of that opportunity for sure! Great go-go dancers, and sexy bartenders. Very attentive staff (other than at the door) and an awesome place to be overall. I will be back for sure!. It's not too often you can walk into a casino in Vegas and feel like you're THE high roller, but at Bill's, you certainly can. Okay, we mostly went here because we were with our friend Bill, and we all thought it would be funny to go into Bill's. Looking back, it was a lot funnier last night when we were all tipsy and stupid. 

We were seeking fun, $5 craps tables, and we found them! The table was cold when we got there, but we left, about $500 ahead. The crew at the table was really into having a fun time, and helped us remember all of our bets when we were a little buzzed. The cocktail waitresses were awesome and on their game (still a little drunk writing this now, actually). I know this place used to be called Barberry Coast, but I think the new name is more fun. It's like you're actually playing with friends, rather than being robbed by pirates.. The best place in Southside for sure ! First they have a pool on the roof !! Second and most important the drinks and awesome and the staff are so friendly ! They found out it was birthday and they gave a bottle champagne :) you get more of a laid back feel compared to Diesel but the best part is you can go to both bars because skybar is above diesel and since diesel gets crowded a little it's nice to have a place to go and enjoy the view of the city ! The security is a little strict my friend forgot her ID at my house and we had to go 15 mins back to my house to get it but he gave us a free drink for the hassle! This is the kind of place where me and my girlfriends can go and feel safe . Just DONT forget your ID lol. AMAZING FOOD!  This is the best place for Sunday Brunch in Vegas.  Forget about the boring buffets with their lukewarm and dried out offerings.  Every plate at BG is made fresh to order.  For the price of the average brunch buffet you can eat the menu--fresh and delicious--for only $35.99.  You can add $8.00 all you can drink mimosas (they have about 6 different ones).  Our favorite dishes were the Maple Pork Belly and waffle, the Short-Rib Hash, Papas Rajas Taco and the French Toast Bread Pudding. You will not be disappointed.. I'm staying at the Hilton & a familiar face, within walking distance, was in order. This fit the bill perfectly. Excellent bartenders, hats off to Mallory & Miranda. So-so beer selection, tho, that's why the 4 star instead of 5.  

I ordered the ribeye, very rare, & was brought a ribeye mid well, much to my chagrin. Mallory watched me cut into it & immediately whisked it away for another try. The second steak could only have been better had it been first. Fork tender & seasoned to perfection. 

The regulars at the bar are a hoot & very informative to those who don't know the area. I will definitely be back!. Love this coffee shop. Love the ambiance. Great cozy place to read a book. Coffee is pretty good as well. Super friendly staff and yummy treats as well :). Big deli sandwiches.  Multiple variations on a rueben. We had an corned beef and pastrami sandwich which was excellent.  Kids chicken fingers and fries were a hit. All kinds of cookies brownies cakes, etc etc.. Very busy tonight so we sat  in the bar area. We had margaritas during happy hour and were able to order from the  full menu. I had orange chicken and my husband had the teriyaki chicken. All was very good. We used a coupon for one appetizer or dessert and two entrees. The only dessert available for the coupon had walnuts  in it and my husband is allergic to them so they let us substitute. Our server was fantastic!!!. When this place was first opened, I wrote it off... It seemed a little bland at first, despite a nice blue paintjob....and the crowd just was generally older... Not really my scene.

Then, some fellow Yelpers had a meetup here prior to a movie at Fountain Park and I was pleasantly surprised to see that this set-up was pretty decent. I have since returned numerous times and it's unexpected favourite.

Drinks can be a little above average price but affordable, I think the Fountain's best feature is the ambiance. If you have had a long day and you'd like to unwind with a nice cold drink, this is the place to be. A very nice place where there isn't insanely loud music and you can actually talk. It also doubles as a great place to hang out prior to movies.

On to the food, I LOVE their fries... So big and crispy and it comes in a pot... My friends are a fan of its fruit ciders. For me, I always go for their ginger beer.. I love the Tri Tip when I eat here. My networking meeting is here 2 times/month. The service is friendly, food is great and so are the prices. Next time I am going to try the rib eye steak. Can't go wrong at this restaurant.
Carolyn V. Due to insurance purposes, I have to go to DPA for my ultrasounds. This is my first pregnancy and as to be expected from a first time mom, things can be a little nerve-wracking. I've felt comfortable at DPA from the moment I entered the waiting room. I have never waited more than 10 minutes to be called back into one of the rooms. The entire staff is friendly and personable. I see Dr. Schwartz there and he is a great guy who knows his stuff and keeps it real.. I love this park so much. I lived around the corner so I called Papago my home for a few years. The area is safe and you'll see college kids and family's out playing with dog and their children. You'll see people out jogging or walking on the trails. There's a pretty decent size dog park.  The condition it is in varies. There is street parking. Just head under the bridge and your at Tempe town lake.. I love this place. Great food, friendly people and super fast service. Best tzatziki sauce around!. Bobby's statue is located on the corner of Candlemakers Row and King George IV Bridge, just outside Greyfriars church and graveyard. Bobby is buried in the Greyfriars graveyard, near the front. Both Bobby's and his master graves are marked with headstones.. I moved out here a year ago, &I DID MY RESEARCH before going to a new place to get my eyebrows threaded. I came here to the lake mead location and the ladies r so nice,they make conversation w/u and I LOVE how my eyebrows come out. The reason I gave it 4 stars was b/c there is only 1 girl there whom I do not like ,shes done my eyebrows twice and she's just rude with her idgaf face all the time &when she does my eyebrows they grow out really  quick! Idk what she does wrong I just don't like her. But aside from her, everyone else is super nice I love this place!. I was excited and nervous to visit this exhibit becuase I thought I was going to be grossed out by seeing the bodies, but I wasn't. I was completely fascinated by the experience. To literally see what it looks like inside of yourself is a bit surreal. I learned a lot about the human body I had not realized before.

My only wish was that there was a guided tour. There is just so much to see and try to understand. They did have a gentleman doctor/scientist that was ready to answer any questions and was extremely informative but I would have rather had him guide us and just keep telling us what he knows. There is the option to get the audio recordings but it's not the same as being able to stop and ask questions and learn more.. When you have to have that caffeine hit, this is the place to go!  The coffee was great and served quickly.  For those coffee needs... go here.. This was my second time there and I have to give it 5 stars. Here's why:

I stayed here for two nights with friends and my husband on a Thursday and Friday night. We had two corner suites between the five of us.

Pros:
+ Our suite was huge!  It was large enough that two people couple easily live there because it's the same size as most regular one bedroom apartments.
+ The views were amazing.  Amazing!
+ Everything was clean.  The towels were fresh, the linens, felt perfect, and the kitchen and bathroom were spotless.
+ The elevators are super quick.
+ Checking in was a breeze.
+ Valet is free (but tipping is always nice) and the bell hops brought up our bags within minutes of calling for them
+ Blackout curtains-- sleeping in is not a problem
+ Super quite-- an extra plus if you're there not to party or if you're sleeping in after partying
+ Smoke free-- clean air and healthy lungs! :)
+ The bartenders at the bar downstairs are such chill, super nice, and have some really good tips.
+ A small shop to buy food and drinks downstairs
+ No casino in this hotel [OMG where will you ever find somewhere to gamble at?! Oh wait, it's everywhere else...]
+ Price: at least the weekend we were here, it was only about $30 more a night to stay here in a suite versus staying at much older and not as nice casinos

Cons: 
- Checkout was a mess because their system was down (so no checking out from the TV in the from); but my husband is a smart guy, so instead of waiting in the long line, he called from the lobby and checked out right away while we watched everyone else in line.
- No casino in this hotel [OMG where am I going to gamble?! Oh wait, there are casinos everywhere else...]

Side notes:
+ I called housekeeping to request more toiletries from the hotel and they brought up about a two weeks supply for me.  Awesome.
+ Bellagio and Aria are all a three minute walk away!. I love Emotions of Lights, and the personal service they give!  They did my sons graduation photos, and everyone wants to know who did them. They took the time to find out what his passions are, and incorporated them into his photos. We are very please and you will love their work!. Here on a recommendation I was already looking forward to my rare style hit for the day before mounting the stone steps and entering the chilled space. 

The name 'Barber' not to be confused with male only clientele, I am a woman, seeking a woman's cut, and that is what I got. 

Being a late appointment on a Monday evening I was the only one getting the chop treatment and wow it felt good. After a visionary chat I knew the hairdresser was able to style as required and it was time to relax and watch Stockbridge pass by.

Excellent value for a wash, cut and style: £27.50. I left thankful, beaming and bouncing along the cobbles!. Suggestion to budget-conscious hipsters: stop by Boris and Natasha for inspiration, then head down the street to Hong Kong Vintage to capture the funky retro vibe for a fraction of the cost. This little vintage boutique is fun to browse through whether or not you buy anything at all; it's like a little museum of clothing in Plaza-Midwood. 

Prices are cheap; clothes are sorted and displayed according to garment type and color. Although space is tight, everything is neatly, but snugly, arranged. You'll feel like you just walked in to your mom's, grandmom's and cool aunt's closet. In short- a girl's dream!! 

If you've actually got the moxy to wear vintage in Bank Town USA, this could be your one-stop shop. For the rest of us, it's a great way to pick up a completely unique accessory or one-of-a-kind find.. So funny story... my husband and I travel to Las Vegas frequently and were recommended to have dinner at Echo and Rig. As I was eating the delicious portabello fries, I realized that I had had them before in LA (my home town). So I stated - out loud - these fries are just like the fries at Bottega Louie (my fave restaurant in LA)! Then the waiter says, it's the same owner! WHAT. I honestly wasn't expecting that... especially in a different state!!! Anyway dinner was AMAZING. I will be back for SURE.. I was very satisfied with the Pomo pizza I had. I have to say that it is the best pizza I had.. My 2nd time moving with this company. I never had any damages to my items and they always got everything in and out very quickly! I don't like to move, so if someone can make the job easy for me, I'll pay. I had no stress the whole move. They rented the Uhaul for me, and even drove it. No stress. Soooo easy and fast! 

IF I have to move again... (Which I don't hope anytime soon)  I will come right back to this company.. First time here and I'm very impressed.  Great atmosphere great sushi.  Had the aloha roll (it was awesome).  Very diverse menu so the no -sushi crowd can be happy while we dig in.  Sake menu limited but great  drink menu.  Fresh, quality, size of the nigiri.  I will be back!!!. I've never had a problem at this office. The staff is always polite. I've been getting shots here for a while now and I'm being treated for my asthma as well.. I traveled all the way from Philly to see my favorite band, of Montreal, perform at the Altar Bar and I was totally blown away by this venue.  The cathedral ceilings and stained-glass windows really gave the entire concert a spiritual dimension.  Acoustically I was very impressed with the sound quality.  I felt like every instrument sounded so clear and distinct (probably due in large part to the building architecture.  I didn't get a chance to get anything from the bar but I really liked the way it was set up.  It seemed like a cool place to hang out or go for driniks.  I wish I didn't have to travel the entire way across Pennsylvania to go to this bar again!!. OMG! After coming here for the first time and having their sausage pizza, I can't enjoy any other pizzas lol. This place is crazy good! Big slices of sausage, oozing cheese.... when I took my first bite, the crispiness of the crust.. it was heaven. Got me and my sister wanting another slice. Next time we come here, definitely getting the whole pie cause its 5 dollars a slice and between me and my sister getting two slices each, it was already close to the price of a whole pie. Fountain drinks here are a tad overpriced especially when they serve it in those little red party cups.. Food was delicious and the service was good. Cornbread is served with butter for the appetizer. My French Dip sandwich was served with flavorful au jus. My husband enjoyed his burger. For dessert he ordered a slice of pecan pie and I had the cheesecake. Both were really tasty. Hits the spot if you're looking for some good old fashioned comfort food.. Seriously, how have you lived your life so far in the Valley without knowing about this place??? Best. Stuff. EVER. 

My mouth is watering now as I'm starting to write this... Those enchiladas... yum... After we discovered it, we've been religiously visiting it whenever we can get a day off, early in the morning and you really need to get in as soon as they open, because the place gets packed and line forms around 11.30... which is 30 minutes after opening. Whatever special they have going on for the day, it's gone by 12... Soooo, yeah, get in early :D You won't make a mistake with whatever you try! The ingredients that they use and have to offer are just great and fresh all the way. And you can see them right there in front of you!

Do yourself a favor and get to it whenever you can!. My husband took me here for my 30th birthday, and it was phenomenal. We stayed in a 1-bedroom suite, and seriously felt like rock stars! The entire staff went out of their way to make sure our stay was perfect. They gave me chocolates for my birthday when we checked in (so sweet...literally), allowed us a VERY early check in, and upgraded us to a strip-view high-level room. I was a little skeptical about the whole "no casino" thing, but it ended up working out great. The entrance to the hotel is right off the Miracle Mile, which leads to the Planet Hollywood casino.

Overall, I would highly recommend Elara for anyone. It offers the perfect balance between luxury and budget. That, and I can't imagine a nicer staff anywhere on the strip. 

Tip: The 1-bedroom suite can sleep 4 VERY comfortably! Since the bathroom has entrances off the bedroom and the living room, it offers adequate privacy if you're staying with 2 couples. That feature, plus the nice sized kitchen makes it an awesome room for 2 couples traveling together.. Lots of different people but I love Kerry. She does amazing 3D and they stay on. She is very creative!. I consider to be the best Cuban restaurant in Vegas. It is a bit of a haul for us considering that its sister restaurant, Florida Cafe, is located less than ten minutes from our house, but the food at Havana Grill is a lot better for some reason and therefore worth the drive. Though the service isn't super speedy, you are perfectly occupied with slices of buttered and grilled cuban bread you will need to restrain yourself from finishing. After limiting myself to one piece (ok, one and a half), I had my favorite dish, the ensalada playera ($10 for lunch), which I was glad to see served on a regular plate rather than the ridiculous and impractical shell-shaped bowl it previously was served in. This salad contains small succulent shrimp, ripe avocado, baby tomatoes, roasted red bell peppers, and sliced red onion atop a bed of beautifully assembled mixed field greens, and is served with a mojo dressing that is wonderfully pungent with lemon and garlic. It reminds me of a salad you can get at a good cafe in California where fresh and healthful ingredients parallel intense flavor and a sense of hearty satisfaction. I have no complaints whatsoever about the salad because it is exactly the kind of food I like to enjoy. If you are looking for something a bit more filling without feeling stuffed, however, you should get what my husband got, the pollo alla plancha ($10 for lunch). This is a thinly pounded chicken breast grilled to perfection and served with sauteed onions. The onions could definitely be sauteed longer to get some nice caramelization, but the chicken is great and the accompanying 'moros y cristianos' (black beans and white rice) are to die for! The flavors of the latter meld together with bits of tender pork to create a Cuban staple you'll want to eat over and over again.

Another item we usually get is the Cuban sandwich. In case you've never had one, a Cuban sandwich consists of sliced ham, roast pork, pickles, and swiss cheese pressed on a white Cuban bread loaf spread with mustard until it is warm and melty. The version here is well-executed and tasty, and, although I've had better in New York, we haven't found another in town that compares. They offer it in a half size as well, which would be enough for an appetizer for two or a small meal.

Although the food prices here are fairly reasonable for what you get (dinner gets more expensive), drink prices are absolutely not. Even the Strip can't get away with charging $6 for a Miller Lite, unless perhaps you are at one of the best restaurants, and they generally don't even serve Miller Lite. Even worse, the beer at Havana Grill doesn't come to the table icy cold. Perhaps they are trying to give you a taste for authentic Cuban refrigeration temperatures, but at these prices I want refrigeration you can expect at a Ritz Carlton (or any decent bar). Anyhow, just thought I should let you know what you're in for before you get the bill.. I had delivery, got it hot, and got it the way I wanted it, would have been five stars but they forgot my tea.
I ordered crab puffs, a chicken and shrimp egg roll, and house lo-mein.
The shrimp was perfectly cooked in the lo-mein, the crab puffs were crispy and they didn't scrimp on the cream cheese inside, plenty of sauce to go around.  
I will definitely be ordering from there again. Wow, talk about customer service. Everyone here from the bellman to the wait staff, to the front desk were all so nice. People were constantly checking on me to see if I was happy with the service and if I needed anything else.

I'm usually not fond of the desert because I love the ocean, but this is one of those places I would definitely like to go to if I were to go to the desert. The casitas are cute and comforting. Everything has the southwest feel from the interior designs to the food. I was fortunate to be here on a beautiful clear and cool day. The skies were blue and the temperature was in about the mid 70s. Each of the casitas has their own fireplace and a patio deck. Some have pool views or mountain views. A few people I knew were climing pinnacle peak during the day, so if you're up for some good workout, you can ask the concierge for directions.

From the bar area near the lobby, you can see a view of Scottsdale and Pinnacle Peak. I highly recommend hanging out here near sunset...it's romantic.. This is another establishment (along with Jack in the Box and In 'n Out) that East Coast residents are not so fortunate to have available.

Now, this may sound like utter blasphemy, but... out of the three above that I tried, I have to say that I liked Del Taco the best.  It reminds me of an upscale Taco Bell, if there is such a thing.  The burritos that I tried were very fresh, well made and quite filling (though I was a bit puzzled by the fries that they're paired with - somehow a burrito and fries don't mesh well in my mind, you know what I'm saying?).  The prices are about on par with the Taco Bell establishments around here... but, yeah, the food at Del Taco is definitely better-tasting.  

The countergirl was a sweetheart.  We had a brief conversation about how we over here on the East Coast didn't have such luck and how I was going to miss them when we left Vegas, heh.  True story.  She's probably heard it all before, though.

Eventually when we move out West (which we're planning), I'll have this deliciousness all of the time.. I go here at least once a week, sometimes more. The food tastes like it is made with love! The staff are seriously the best ever. They feel like family! Every so often a dish will disappoint me but when you eat as much as I do, it's bound to happen.. I so love Jamba Juice.  My oldest daughter and I used to go to the one in Pasadena every other day after the gym.  My favorite Jamba is Mach green tea love it.  They don't have it on the menu anymore but if you ask they will make it for you. Try it I think you guy's might like it .  Happy yelping 


your yelpie 
Terri xoxoxoxo. I think everyone needs to be quiet dewey is the best everyone has those moments or bad days or even days where we mess up no one is perfect. they work hard and care a lot about ur animals.. Loved this place!! I went with two other people and we all made the mistake of getting one dish per person. I recommend sharing. I can put down food like no other but I could barely finish 1/2 of my French toast!!! 

Speaking of the French toast, the chocolate chip French toast is BOMB. If you love chocolate chip cookies like I do, you will agree. Also, the whip cream on top is delicious. 

Oh but they will ask you if you want bacon or potatoes on the side... I don't recommend that you do. The potatoes weren't anything special & you will be too full to eat them anyways.. I have never been a great chocolate lover, but I do love sweets and finely crafted food.  Which is why after having tasted the chocolates from Chocofin, they are the only thing I put on my Christmas list this year!  I recommend the sea salt caramel truffles and the red chili truffles.  I have also tasted several cakes at different events in town and can honestly say that I haven't found anything there that wasn't wonderful.. Dr. Swan resolved a long standing medical issue for me that had completely stumped four other highly recommended doctors.  I was in pain and feeling pretty hopeless when I first saw Dr. Swan.  She took her time, listened carefully, and explained her plan of action thoroughly.  By the time of my follow up visit I was feeling healthy and strong again.  I appreciated the fact that Dr. Swan uses a natural approach to health care as I would prefer to avoid prescription medication whenever possible (none of the prescriptions from my other providers had helped anyway).  Dr. Swan is now my go to physician for all my health care needs.  I feel very lucky to have been referred to her.. What a nice surprise!  Noble Eatery is in an obscure part of town, but this restaurant makes it a destination.  I loved the rustic feel inside and the smells that welcomed me made me know I was in for a treat once I walked in the doors.  The staff was very friendly and helpful with recommendations.  The prosciutto sandwich was absolutely incredible - great quality ingredients and honestly, that bread is to die for.. I am not a huge fan of Thai food, mainly because I have not been exposed to enough of it...but I CRAVE the Beef Panang from Wild Thaiger!  I have had it twice along with the Pad Thai and Kimowi (sp?).  The iced green tea was refreshing and wished I had saved room for the lemon ginger cheesecake.  
I have tried dining in and take out both (dinner only), and the only reason I don't go 5 stars is the very slow (but friendly) service.  Plan to wait at least 5 minutes to be greeted by your server and once the food is finally served...your on your own.. I came here last week for the international supper club. Unlike my fellow Yelpers, I did not have time to investigate the menu online beforehand so I was not really sure what to order. Apparently their specialty is their sausages, which everyone at the table agreed were quite good, but my husband and I stuck with some safe choices. I got the stuffed cabbage and he ordered the steak sandwich. My mother's side of the family is Polish and growing up she would make stuffed cabbage regularly so it is something I really enjoy eating. These were a little smaller than hers but they serve you three of them so it was a very filling meal. They were cooked well, pretty much the same as my moms but less rice in the filling and the spices were a little different. I liked that they came with a good amount of tomato broth (some restaurants serve them with a thick gravy like sauce that I think is gross) and I really enjoyed sopping the juices up with the toasted pita-ish Bosnian flat bread that they served with it. The hubby also enjoyed his sandwich - you can never go wrong with steak in his book. This was a pretty big piece of meat that he got and it was real steak, not minced meat - it even had a big bone in it! We ended the meal with Turkish coffee and baklava. The coffee was very good. It was really strong but very smooth and even though it was unfiltered all the sediment magically settled to the bottom so it was not grainy at all. I am not sure if you are supposed to drink the pasty part at the bottom of the cup but I did not. The baklava was pretty similar to what I have had at Greek restaurants but perhaps a little less sticky sweet so personally I preferred this version to most others I have tried even though it is not one of my favorite deserts.

The best part about Caffe Sarajevo was the place itself. Even though it does not look appealing from the outside it has a totally charming interior. And staff. Our waiter was very friendly, helpful and courteous. We had excellent service. But even though the food and service were good I might not give it more than 3 stars if it weren't for the price. This place is just a really amazing value! My entree was only $5 and I think our total bill including drinks and dessert was less than $20 for the two of us. Overall, if it wasn't so incredibly far from where I live and in a part of town I never go to I would be back for sure.. I was a walk in customer at david and friends, luckily Rylee was available :) she was awesome and loved the way she did my hair! I recommend you to go see her if you're thinking about going. On their website there is also a discount 25% off services :) definitely going back to see Rylee.. I've never seen a kids menu available at a Japanese or Asian fusion restaurant. The little boy dining near us was given one of those training chopsticks that are screwed together and all you have to do is pinch...or maybe it was his own...unsure. Haha. 

The ambiance was just lovely. While my fellow diner and I waited for our order, we gazed the room and talked about it for a good 10 minutes. 

The server was very friendly-all smiles- and she described all the dishes we had questions about and gave us great recommendations. We ordered:

seviches and tiraditos (4 assortments for $35, good deal)
      -jumbo shrimp =very fruity, didnt mix with the salty items, but good
      -kanpachi = a very anomalous taste, you'd either hate or love it
      - yellowtail tiradito = yellowtail is alwayys yumm
      - yellowtail seviche = recommended along with ^

we ordered three samba rolls
1) samba strip roll (maine lobster) = good amount of lobster and was yummy.
2) Bobo Brazil (seared kobe beef) = was pretty good
3) Pacific (crab) = mediocre

This place is a little pricey, but you can't get these rolls elsewhere can you? Idk, you try and tell me.. I have heard so many great things about this place (It was on Diner's Drive-Ins & Dives!) and we finally decided to get our taco-loving booties over there to try it! Ohhh my goodness, I am so happy that we did!! 

They have the most amazing fresh salsa bar with at least 10 different salsas made daily. Being a sauce lover, this was a complete dream come true. I recommend getting the two taco plate with rice and beans. I got the Aztec Tinga Taco (Shredded Chicken, Tomato, Onion & Aztec chipotle sauce) and it was SO juicy with the perfect combination of spices. I also got a Carne Asada taco that was delish! The restaurant is small and I hear it gets busy so I would recommend dining here during off days/times. We went on a Thursday night at 7:30 PM and it was perfect!!! We will for sure be back, i've been daydreaming of their fabulous salsa bar ever since we left!. Meatballz has become a daily stop for me lately.  It's the only place around I can get a reasonably priced lunch salad that's fresh and delicious!  The Italian dishes look and smell amazing but I've been sticking to salads lately so that's all I've had, but I'm sure I will try other things eventually.  Their tuna salad is probably one of the best I've ever had.. I really liked this place. The food was good and the strawberry lemonade was even better. It was not to sweet and they put real strawberries at the bottom.. I'm from Charlotte and have never found the right stylist until I found Bonnie Nixon.  I get rave reviews about my cuts and even raver reviews about my color.  I can finally relax knowing that my hair is in good hands; the best hands in Charlotte!!. Ms Julia is a gem!  She made sure my pressing was done in a short period of time and her customer service is impeccable.  I am the customer who was abandonded by two taxi's the weekend of the Marine Corps Ball at the New Orleans.  I wish this cleaners years of success.  Thank you for your going above and beyond usuall customer service.. Great   experience   with Lauren.  Went. In for highlights.  Sweet  girl. Did a great job of getting my color just right. Cute little salon. Very friendly team. Excited to go back and have already booked my additional services. 
How great to have almost everything you need under one roof! 
They use Aveda products so everything is natural and healthier for your hair! Definitely recommend this place and Lauren.. Really fun atmosphere.  Good music.  Dark and intimate.  Large private booths are perfect for chillin' with a group of friends.  The food is heavy and the portions are very very large.  I am not in love with the fish dishes.  But the meat dishes are really tasty - I had the most fantastic pork tenderloin here...  this is a nice place to take out-of-towners for a casual upscale meal with local flavor and atmosphere.

In the spirit of full disclosure, I would like to add there I don't consider much of the menu to be true "cuisine of New Mexico".  I am from New Mexico, so I know what I am talking about. (fyi - Carlsbad Tavern in South Scottsdale is the most authentic New Mexico cuisine I have had in the Valley).  As Omer notes, it is smoky and the food is hit or miss.  I came here for lunch and was not at all impressed.  However, I was won over when I came here for dinner with a group of friends.  This is a fun place at night and several dishes are quite good.. Was here for a business meeting in their private dining room. Dinner was a prix fixe menu however it could not have been any better. 
Started off with the ceaser salad which was dressed perfectly with a large crunchy parmesan crouton crisp. Exactly how I like it. 
Main course was the filet. Cooked to absolute perfection. It was so tender I could almost cut my steak with a fork. Normally thick filets come out tough or a touch dry, not this one. It was so mouthwateringly good that I polished off the whole thing.
Sides: Cream of corn is a win and the mushrooms with caramelized onions had an awesome flavor. Not bland like what I imagined sautéed mushrooms would taste like.
Desserts was a tray of mini samplings of cheesecake bites, carrot cupcake, and what appeared to be a peanut butter cup. Let's just say I had one of eat and I wish there was more on the plate. 
Overall great atmosphere. Has a modern hip feel. I would return to try their other dishes. I lost my mind over the half chicken. I don't know what Samantha G. got but that chicken was spot on- crispy skin, hint of smokey, finger lickin' greasy, just salty enough and so good I ate a leg and took a bite out of my husband's wing- I'm a picky chicken eater and usually skip these parts. Frankly, I like chicken fine but am not the biggest fan in my family- THIS chicken however- wow.
I cannot wait to go back and get the meat platter. I might disaparate in happiness.

Oh- Arepas also very good. Can't rave about the texture (I found it a bit crumbly) but the Pernil (pork butt) was off the charts good. We got it with avocado and I recommend you do the same.

I second the "crack sauce" suggestion- it would make shoe leather taste good.

Mango agua fresca also very good- not too sweet as it often is at a Taqueria.

So - why no 5 stars? Well, maybe I'm being overly picky because that chicken was amazing, but I do five stars for a home run and their sides were lackluster and the arepa was a little dry. Is this overly harsh? 

The bathroom was functional and clean but not good enough to bump them to 5 stars, I liked the small utilitarian steel sink, but not a lot else to commend it..

I'm gonna stick with 4 stars on this but let's call this "unequivocally recommended." We'll see what happens after that meat platter.. I hired the ladies from Perfect Hair and Makeup for my Las Vegas wedding on March 13th, 2012. They required no deposit for four ladies, and came to my hotel room without a surcharge.

First of all, they work at the same time, so you don't feel like you're sitting in a chair forever. They both asked me what I liked before they started and I gave them some loose guidelines. I told them what makeup I usually wear and what hairstyle I liked, and they went to town. I had the airbrush makeup done (with lashes, which are applied individually) and it felt very light and fresh. My hair was done before I knew it, which is great because she didn't yank or pull or stab with me bobby pins. Their rates are very competitive (especially compared to hotel salon prices which were double).

Also, I had a friend who loved our hair and makeup so much that she asked them if they could squeeze her in last minute and they made it happen.

My hair and makeup lasted all day. One thing I would warn about though is that we all had one hell of a time getting the false lashes off. They weren't kidding when they said they might stay on for a couple days. Makeup remover and patience helped a lot.. I bought tickets by calling them, and found that it was better than buying online tickets because you can be really specific about where you want to be seated and ask them for their personal advice (though one of the ladies that worked there was absolutely rude).

Anyway, the show was amazing and the stage is incredible.  I have to say that despite all the hype and how everyone says it's the best Cirque du Soleil show.... I can't agree for some reason... I've also watched Alegria and Corteo.. I must say after reading bad reviews I was very hesitate to shop here. I needed a solid but very reasonably priced couch for a rental condo.
More than please with my choices, material and delivery. I purchased the Rydall couch.
I'm not young, and have had many years purchasing furniture in many price ranges.. Great service, great prices, and great plumbing. I have never found a more trustworthy plumber. Plus, it is a father-son business.. Great training experience! I love the environment, music and the trainers. I have noticed a change in my physical appearance and each workout program challenges me to push harder.  The trainers are elite aerobatic/gymnastic athletes and have a background of high level of training.  I highly recommend Intermix Fitness! Get started today!!!. Only once in my life have I ever craved a resturants food all the time. Maize would be the resturant I am talking about. I absolutely love the food!! Every food item I've had has been amazing! So fresh and real! Haha. I come here all the time! The service is great as well.  The servers are always friendly and kind. This place is small and the line is always out the door but it's so worth it!!!!!. One of my absolute favorites in CU, Courier Cafe is the best place to relax and get some delicious American food. Old fashioned soda fountain favorites like phosphates and malt shakes make this place unique, but nearly everything is good. Sandwiches are on fresh bread,  and burgers are thick and hearty. There are a lot of vegetarian options- my favorite is the pesto grilled swiss on sourdough. I also love the ham melt on a fresh croissant. For dessert I recommend sharing a headliner, a monstrously delicious sundae drenched in hot fudge.

For the quality of food you get, this place is actually a bargain. I'd prefer it over most of CU's "fine dining" establishments any day. Service can be slightly slow, but overall this is one of my favorite places to enjoy after a difficult test or a arduous paper-writing spree.. Consistent friendly service and quality products!  Clean facility.  My favorite cold drink is Jasmine dragon tea latte iced.. My first experience here was great. I called and placed my order and the waitress was very courteous and helpful.  I ordered Spring rolls, pad Thai,drunken noodles with beef, and the garlic short ribs. The total came to 41 dollars and we got home the food was piping hot and delicious. The spring rolls were nice and crisp and came with a sweet sauce to dunk them in. The pad Thai was ok,I have had better but it was chock full of fresh veggies and had a nice flavor. I ordered the drunken noodles with a spicy level of 8 and they were tolerably spicy and oh so good! Loved all the flavors and the hint of fresh basil. The beef was sliced thin and very tender. I would have to say the star of the meal were the BBQ pork ribs. Big, tender, sticky and sweet.  Wow!  The garlic short ribs were good too but next time will just order the pork ribs and drunken noodles.. fresh, yummy and genuine staff.  hidden treasure!. I had a hankering for an egg roll one day. Sometimes these things happen. If you don't judge me, I won't judge you. I poked around on my Yelp App until I found a decent place near to where I was lurking that day. Soho Bistro has a rather fancy website that I found I couldn't resist!

I ordered a few things, because you can't just get egg rolls. What about when you are also craving crab rangoon? And, hey, look they've got honey walnut prawns on the menu. Seaweed salad? That sounds healthful, and I tend to like seaweed. Let's do it!

- Egg rolls - straightforward. did the job.
- Crab rangoon - really really mushy and had.. carrot in there? shredded carrot? I can't say I liked it.
- Honey walnut prawns - No. They were fried and came in a thick brown sauce with vegetables. This is not what it's supposed to look like. These were definitely NOT the droids I was looking for.
- Seaweed salad - Awesome, if a bit plain. I could have done without the pointless bed of shredded lettuce on the bottom. But the seaweed itself was awesome.
- Sauce - The sweet and sour sauce that generally comes with the fried goodies was really weird here. It was really dark red and syrupy, and did not taste very pleasant. I can't recommend it.

Huge bonus points for 
1. having a great website 
2. having a menu on the website. 
3. being able to order online. 
4. having a REALLY awesome staff person answer the phone, answer questions, and even brought my food to the curb before I even slowed to a stop.

The place is definitely different, but I'm willing to give some of the other stuff a try. Being Chinese, I'm really picky about my Chinese food, and I've already rejected most of the other joints in the area.. This is the place to be in Charlotte. I am a nighttime gym-goer, and I needed a gym with late night hours. The Dowd is open until 10 during the week, which while I would prefer 11, works for me. Also, going at non-peak hours saves me from the parking and crowding issues that others seem to face- ain't no crowds at 9:30 pm! I generally stay in the Women's Fitness Center, which is a gym inside itself, but every now and then I'll make it upstairs. The desk staff is always friendly, and there are plenty of amenities to utilize. The one area I haven't ventured into yet are the group exercise, mainly for scheduling reasons, but I am eager to sneak into one one day.. Finally tried Ronnie's for breakfast. BEST crispy home fries/breakfast potatoes ever!! Huge pancake was excellent too. Eggs over medium were cooked to perfection. Staff treated us as if we were regulars (and it was our first time). Highly recommend!! A must try!. I am really impressed with this restaurant/bar.  I got the delux burger which was very flavorful, although the bread was a little too dense.  The sweet potato fries, served in a mini shopping cart, are awesome - a must have.  They have a great selection of beer, including my favorite framboise lambic.  The beer flights might be an interesting choice for my next visit.  The decor is nice with soothing blue lighting.  Be aware of the close sitting quarters.  I wasn't sure about the communal counter in the middle of the restaurant, but it turned out to be pretty good.  I was still able to have a decent conversation with my friend without feeling like someone else is listening to us or like I am intruding on another conversation.  Overall, a great place that I will visit again.  Especially since it is open late.. I am giving this restaurant 5 stars because it is an excellent value for your money.  The atmosphere closely resembles a traditional Irish pub with dark wood paneling, dim lighting and wood tables.  We started our meal with the beer and cheese dip, which was outstanding.  I actually hate beer, so I wasn't expecting to enjoy this appetizer, but it was incredible.  We also ordered the drunken onion rings, which were quickly consumed by our group.  I ordered the horseradish crusted sea bass for my entree and loved every bite.  My friend who ordered the New York steak encrusted with blue cheese said that it was the best steak he had ever eaten.  Our server was right there when we needed her and answered all of our questions about the menu.  Typically one does not think of fine dining when one thinks of Irish cuisine, but I can't say enough good things about the food and atmosphere at Nine Fine Irishmen.  We spent about $40 per person including beer and cocktails, which I felt was an excellent value.  Highly recommended!. Best ambiance ever and our server was BY FAR the best I've ever had. Jennifer Siegel. I will come back for the sushi and her.. Had lunch here today.   Took a few extra minutes to clean off tables and seat us but were friendly.  Lunch specials were a great deal (hubby had the Beef Panang* {gf}
spicy red chili curry for $7.95)
but while my Seafood Panang was delicious, I thought the portion would be a tad larger for $16.95.  Lunch was fantastic and we will be back but I'll stick to a more budget friendly lunch special.. Love this place! The menu has great variety and so far everything I've tasted has been great! The only downfall is the longer waits and not enough locations! But this ones close to home and is in a busy area but so worth it! (: The staff is always friendly and helpful which makes the experience easy going!. This time I had a plan: share a martini and save room for the warm butter cake!

Since our server, Leonard, kindly allowed me to split a martini with my friend, I actually remember my second visit to Mastro's in its entirety: from the amazingly addictive pretzel rolls, to the heirloom tomato and Campagna burrata salad, to the filet mignon (served with Bearnaise sauce, upon request), to the lobster mashed potatoes--and, finally, the famed warm butter cake.

This cake, alone, is worth 5 stars! The warm butter cake portion was more than enough for the three of us, served with a drizzle of berry coulis, sliced strawberries, a scoop of vanilla ice cream melting on top, and, in a separate bowl, enough whipped cream to frost a double-layer cake.

My first spoonful filled my mouth with warm brown sugar-sweet goodness, with the cake texture somewhere between a Genoise and a pound cake. The cake was wonderful on its own but we couldn't help but top our tastes with the whipped cream. We were so full from our meals (most likely due to that extra order of pretzel rolls) that, sadly, we couldn't quite finish the warm butter cake.

I plan to return for an all-carb meal next time: pretzel rolls and warm butter cake!. I'm officially addicted!  Came here at the recommendation of a friend as a fun, alternative to the boring old gym and love, love love it!  I've only worked with Mandee, but she is awesome and professional and really patient.  It's a great workout and super fun with small classes so you can really learn at your own pace.  Definitely worth a try!. I LOVE this restaurant.  They give you an abundance of food, so anticipate taking a doggie bag home.  I had the guacamole and baked pita chips, and grilled veggie chicken sandwich with baked fries.  I am very impressed with this place. The staff was friendly and attentive.  I plan to go back and try something new next time.. I love this store. I could walk around for hours and examine everything. Great place to buy gifts for people who love geology and fossils, and people who make jewelry. The staff is really helpful and friendly!. Delish! Our fave spot for a burger on the strip used to be BLT burger at the Mirage. But after some hype about Holsteins from some friends we decided to give it a try when we were in Vegas. Fabulous spiked shakes and burgers! We have a new fave! The Kobe beef was amazing on both of our burgers... We had the NomNom and Korean Bullgogi and would recommend both! for shakes we did the drunken monkey and grasshopper which I would also recommend! I would probably give it 5 stars but I typically only give a 5 when a place exceeds my expectations!. This salon has everything to offer from a simple manicure to permanent makeup. Everyone here does amazing work and the salon is beautiful inside. I love this place and won't even think of stepping in another salon.. I stopped here yesterday for the 1st time to get a pedicure.  Lee was fantastic.  The shop became very busy while I was there but she did not interrupt my service which some other nail salons do so they don't lose business.  I like to think of myself as a good tipper and for this service I tipped 50% because she was that good.. Very good! Lots of choices and unique sandwich combinations. The sauces, mac n cheese and banana pudding were amazing!. If you are a fan a Coke.  You will love this large store full of Coke Merchandise.  You can also take your photo with the Coke Polar Bear.  They also have a soda shop so if you are wanting a Coke Float or any coke items, here is the place to give yourself a treat.  However, I highly recommend doing the Around the World Taste.  For $7, you get 16 cups of drinks around the world.  Definitely 4-5 people can share this.  It's interesting to taste all the different flavors, but there is one that will make you gag!  Don't say I didn't warn you!! :)  My husband loved it!!. This is my favorite nail spot. 
The actual store is beautiful and exceptionally clean. 
Whoever designed it truly understood aesthetics. 

I love their different pedicure options... The mocha smells amazing. 
The stone massage is so relaxing. 

They also do waxing and I have been so happy with my results. 

Looking forward to getting a facial next week.. About half of San Francisco descends on Scottsdale in March for spring training games so I made it a point to make a reservation here way ahead of time, sight unseen. From the outside, I wasn't sure if I wanted to have a meal at a motel, but once inside I'm glad we followed through. it was my dad's birthday so all the retro charm actually served up some good memories for him when he saw interiors like this the first time. I'm used to small plates meaning "several plates til you feel full." Here that meant two plates. The dressing on the kale salad took away any inherent bitterness and the lamb sausage had a great spice to it. The almond cake was moist and easily divvied up between us.. They have the best and most authentic Chinese food in Madison.  Large portions, but the food is really expensive.  :(  I did however really enjoy the Ma Po Tofu since they include ground pork, which is something most other restaurants leave out to make the dish "vegetarian".  This one is so much better since it's just like the traditional version.. I had no problem checking in. The lady who checked us in was so friendly and patient. So good customer service so far. 

The wear and tear for 14 years around the hotel is noticeable so taking a star away for that. 

The hotel room smelled like flowers so that was a nice touch. 

The furniture is descent and goes with the Parisian theme. 

The view is spectacular from our room. I can see the people in the pool and enjoy the architecture of the Eiffel tower. I can also clearly see the Bellagio water show. 

I can hear the music from the pool area all the way up to the twenty fourth floor. So that kinda sucks. The insulation needs to be better. 

The shops in the lobby are fun to explore so that's a plus. I can always grab a crepe or strawberry daiquiri and be pleasantly pleased. :). great prices - the girls I was with knew their stuff, so we walked by 4 other places that were 50-100% more per half yard than here. a lot of math to do when you're trying to get drunk, i know, but it was worth it. I got the mango berry with an extra shot, and let me tell you, while it was tasty.. i tried so hard and that damn thing just kept regenerating for the first half an hour. it was insane! i just don't know how they do that. also beware of a major brain freezing... it hurts. anyway, be sure to find your way here for some good times, and some good shopping.. Never thought I would be reviewing a bank, but that's the beauty of yelp! You can review so much more than just restaurants! 

I live fairly close to this bank and my parents use dollar bank, which is basically the reason I use them. I have been with this bank for about 8 years or so and have never had a problem with them! I love their free checking and I have a savings account with them as well. Their home equity is awesome too- fixed interest rate of 3.25%. 

This particular branch has very helpful and friendly employees. They have a drive thru and it is always quick and easy. They will even give your dog a treat if they are in the car :). I've also never experienced long lines in this branch which is always nice!. I love this place so many heathy opinions! The employees are always so friendly and helpful! Every time I go in I am learning about different roots and fruits that will help me live a healthier life. Rolled in here at 10:26am with 10 girls for Bachelorette party breakfast, and the host told us they were no longer serving breakfast! Checked their menu, and it said "Breakfast until 10:30am." So we asked the host to ask the kitchen staff if they would still do breakfast for us since it was a special occasion, and they said Yes!

Tall Glasses of water came out right as we were seated
Fresh Orange Juice - not too sweet or pulpy, and tasted like real oranges
Hot Tea came with a choice from a variety that they had in stock
Coffee was piping hot and strong
Bloody Mary came out delicious with a piece of fried bacon instead of celery
Loco Moco - Hawaiian style cooked to order burger patty with gravy over a bed of rice, came with a side of kimchee - served in a skillet -- SPOT ON, yummy! even better with some extra sriracha
Heart and Seoul - Sriracha angus beef patty cooked to order over a bed of fried rice, came with a side of kimchee - served in a skillet -- REALLY GOOD
Wagyu Kobe - Beef patty cooked to order on a bed of spinach, garnished with fried onions, crispy tater tots, salty fried prociutto, and a side of kimchee -- Good, but not thrilling

Manager came out to greet us. All the food came out at the same time. Everyone pretty much finished their plate. Bill was around $16 a person.

Would definitely recommend this as a great place for breakfast or lunch or dinner.. Another Coronado neighborhood gem.

Love it here.  I'm currently finishing up my yoga tasting and can't wait to get back from vacation and throw myself in with a membership.  THe varied classes are amazing.  I think Meagan is my favorite instructor.  She has such a wonderful vibe, and she remembers your name.  For that matter, so does Rebecca (owner)!

I've tried yoga and pilates over the past few years, and nothing has given me the workout SuTRA gives me.  The barre pilates class is a dream and skullpt is incredible.  By the end of any class, my body has been worked but I feel amazing!  Usually when I leave the gym I don't feel amazing, just beat.  SuTRA is such a great boost.

Additionally they have various activities going on at the studio.  They have local artist artwork displayed and a little reception on their own version of first fridays.  Yogavin is coming up, and I can't wait to try it.  They also have massage therapy which I'm itching to utilize because summer in Phoenix is rough and stresses me out.  

But if you come here, don't expect to do relaxing yoga, expect to sweat in the most amazing way possible :). YES. A CLUB THAT DOESN'T PLAY EDM ALL NIGHT. 

And yes, I put that in CAPS.  Because let's be honest .... how much can you really dance at a club that plays fist pumping music all night? I miss the clubs that played hip-hop and songs that you can dance to, bump and grind, and just act silly to.  It's hard to do that with these clubs that have strobing lights and constant sweaty jumping people all around. 

Sure, this club isn't high end.  and yeah, bottle service isn't THAT grand, BUT it's a club that gets down and dirty and you're BOUND to have a good time if you enjoy this music.  It's not classy and it's not bougie, but this is VEGAS people.  don't come here expecting Hakkasan or XS type of people/service/prices.  It won't be.  Just come here if you want a break from the hype and go back to the hip-hop club roots.

This is one of my fave clubs now.

P.S. if you get bottle service, beware of the MEAN bouncers.  They WILL cut off how many people are allowed in the table area and CHASE you down if you hop over to the next table/section (lol).  So if you plan on having a lot of guys on your table, I'd suggest either getting two tables or making sure you guys get there early so the bouncer doesn't cut the guys off.. Great food and great prices. Pho, macaroons, macaroon ice cream sandwiches, tea, service, I give two thumbs up for all!! I wish this place was closer to where I live, but it won't stop me from going. 
I will say the portions here seem bigger-I normally can finish my whole bowl of pho and I couldn't here. I had leftovers. That's it. I want to say GO!! because it's so good, but don't go because I don't want lines out the door.. The two times that I came here I have had a really good experience.They do a really neat and thorough job and my nails always turn out great. They will accommodate any requests for color/designs. Prices are reasonable as well.. This location provides excellent customer service. I have been here twice and both times I was in and out in less than 1 hour without an appointment. This time, I want to mention Jeffrey. He helped me, but I also watched him help many others. He saw someone getting anxious about the time and rather than wait for her to approach  him; he approached her. He asked her if she was in a hurry and helped to ease her concern about it getting finished promptly. He then worked with the techs to make that happen. Later he was so patient when a deaf woman came in and had to write out her requests. He never once lost his patience explaining his responses several times in writing. A true class act. 


Bonus, they support two of my favorite causes Leukemia & Lymphoma and Girls on the run.. Khina is amazing and does the best threading in town! She just switched locations from the Galleria Mall to her new spot off of Eastern. I have been going to her for years now and her new location is amazing. Highly, Highly recommend her!. 4 stars are for my masseuse, Monica. For the spa itself, I would probably give it 2.5 at most. When we first arrived, there wasn't anyone in the front to greet or check us in. We arrived promptly at 3pm, the time of our appt. When we checked in, they rushed us to change because we were already into our 50mins massage time. WTH? Not only that, but they didn't instruct us on anything; what to change into, where to go afterwards, etc. Not only that, but after I changed, I waited close to another 10mins before my masseuse came out! WTF? If you're going to rush your clients, the least you can do is be ready for them when they are. Thankfully my masseuse wasn't like that. She even walked me to the restroom before my appt, then took the time to do a complete massage. I sprained my ankle the night before, so she took extra care of that and even gave me something to put on it afterwards. Wish we had the time to enjoy the rest of their amenities. Loved Monica, didn't like the rest of the staff.. Love. Love. Love. Sprouts! Fresh produce at the best rates as a whole. I like the variety of good snacks for my kids too. I won't buy meat from anywhere else but here. I  Shop here every week and l like getting to know the employees. I see the same ones every week. :) I just wish there was one closer to me but this one is awesome!. Well, more 4.5 stars....Red Square... the restuarant that has something for everyone. 

I came here for my wedding dinner. Staying in the Mandalay Bay, we wanted a place which could accomodate gluten intolerants, a vegetarian, children, and a steak loving husband. Red Square was literally able to accomodate all off one menu.

We had a table for 12 which I was pleasantly unexpected was semi-private. The lighting was adjustable which was awesome as we got to somewhat pick our mood. We ordered a few bottles of wine from the extensive wine list and each bottle was amazing. Somewhat annoyingly though, the gluten intolerants and vegetarian had to take turns with the special menu as they only brought the one. 

I skipped appies (having to not have my dress burst at the seams and all), and had the Filet Mignon for my entree. I'm not a huge red meat eater, but this was a fantastic dish I would order again.  My husband was in steak heaven. All children ate. Gluten intolerants (myself included) were happy), and even the vegatarian was impressed. Dessert was Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee which I now regularly crave and must go back there just to eat. 

Our server was good. He was  accomodating and friendly for the duration of the meal (we were there for about 3 hours), my only complaint was we had a bit of a slow start... I got a little bit impatient waiting to order wine, however after that he was much prompter.. I went here for dessert with my girls and it was DELICIOUS!! we ended up sharing the deep fried oreo sunday and it was really big, the three of us had just gotten out of a show for the convention we were at in cesars palace ( so convenient  to walk from the hotel) we didnt make a reservation but were sat within 10 minutes which was really nice. right after we were sat there were a few different larger parties that checked in and it didn't seem like they waited too long either but I would definitely suggest a reservations because the place isn't huge and I imagine it can get fairly busy. the ice cream sunday was big enough for all of us to share and still not finish the entire thing. the fried oreos were warm and delish not too much fried coating which was nice sometimes they can get really thick and over bearing. but it was a good contrast with the ice cream. definitely will be back. This was my first time eating here, i was amazed how huge the portions are...it's a little more than i like to pay for breakfast but when you see how much you get, even though you can't eat it all, it is worth the price you pay. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone but be prepared to wait.. Loved their pizza. Me and my sister came in and we got the lunch special a 10" pizza which wasn't pricy and later on I just wanted more. Definitely will be coming back.. I was sitting at the bar with two of my friends, having a good ol' bitch fest, when the bartender came over gave us a complimentary shot of "chill the fuck out." That was what he called it - it was just a house whiskey, but it really put us in a better mood.  The service was great. We sat at the bar for probably around 3-4 hours, and were never given the evil eye to move on. 

They make a great Moscow Mule, it's not in a copper cup unfortunately, but is very refreshing for a hot, humid Madison day. I also ordered the French 75 which is another great summer drink. Go during happy hour where many of their craft cocktails are $6.. Amazing pizza and salads.  The Bianca is the only Pizza I've tried here because its so amazing, I don't want anything else.  Would give 5 stars if they had a decent wine list!. Who knew Yelp could give all Elites the opportunity to go Down Under- well at least to the Cactus Rd. Outback!
My friend Reese (who also is Elite) and I were greeted by Lindsey and her new intern Jessica and given 2 bingo cards & 2 drink coins. The girl who won bingo was given a basket full of goodies from Yelp- I was slightly jealous as everything looked great.

We found a spot at the bar and were given a variety of appetizers to try. Among the top 3 were the coconut shrimp with a tangy pineapple sauce,  the Margherita flatbread, and of course the bloomin' onion strips with the signature sauce.  

As for the drinks, the skinny margarita and the rum punch were AMAZING and just what I needed after this long Tuesday! 

All of the servers and bar staff were phenomenal! This was a great elite event!. The food is good a little expensive but worth it. My mini me thought it was great and want to come again. We will on her dime. Check them out. Excited to see Dr. Durisek get a shout out! I met Dr Durisek through a friend two years ago. I've been a patient now for a year. His office is near my house, which is very convenient. Dr. Durisek and staff are wonderful, and make sure that everyone is comfortable. If you are in Central Phoenix and looking for a great Dentist Dr. Durisek and Open Wide Dental should be your destination!. Tried the Angry dog at the foodie festival this weekend and it was the best thing there! Spicy, messy and so damn good. Can't wait to try other dogs!. I recently switched to Eastover OB from another practice and absolutely love them! Dr Bruce Taylor could not be anymore professional and uplifting. Me and my husband have been trying to conceive for about a year, and after looking at my previous file he set a plan of action and I am now pregnant. It is so nice to be listened to and taken seriously by a Dr.  He also did the quickest and least painful pap I have ever had.  Not only his he an exceptional Dr, but his bedside manner is spectacular.. My husband and I recently got married in Las Vegas and chose to have our reception at DCR. We first visited the bar maybe 2 years ago on a tip from another bartender. We LOVED it. Loved the drinks, loved the design of the room, we even loved the hidden front door.

We travel to Las Vegas two or three times a year to see family, and this has become a staple of our visits. When we first spoke to Michael and Jennifer about having our reception there they were extremely helpful and spent a good deal of time talking about our options. On each of our trips I've been excited to try the new cocktails they've crafted for their seasonal menu, and being in the service industry in Chicago this kind of attention to detail and ingredients never disappoints. The drink menu was one of the big selling points for our reception. 

The reception itself was fantastic. The staff were incredible, they treated our guests with the perfect amount of enthusiasm, drink knowledge, and just simply exceptional service. We felt like they were a part of our party, and all of our guests (friends and family) were impressed with the drinks, the service, and the space itself. We brought our own ipod with a pre-made playlist and they hooked it up for us no problem. 

Downtown Cocktail Room has been one of my favorite places in Vegas since my first visit, and they went above and beyond to make sure our wedding reception was flawless.. Omg this little place is delish! It's a ma and pop shop. The owners are so super nice and the cooking is so yummy. It's a small restaurant but with home style cooking. Definitely a must try if u are in the area!. I've gotten my hair cut a few times here and the service is great. My husband also frequents this Great Clips for his monthly trimming. The prices are very fair- $12 for a haircut. If you get put into their system, you'll get coupons every so often for $4.99 haircuts! 

The stylists there are very friendly and listen to what you want. Last time I was there, I went for a new hairstyle. The stylist was honest about the look and updated it a bit so that it would fit my face shape and look the best. I left there feeling and looking like a million bucks.. Great options, great service.  And super delicious food.   Can't believe this place has been open for years right nearby and I've only just tried it.  

Savory and sweet crepes were awesome.  Thai iced tea with boba was a great treat too.

Will be back soon to try the waffles and other desserts!. Andrea is da bomb!. This place is amazing! Just moved to the area and was looking for my  go to salon. I found that today! Nick has taken care of me beyond expectations. I will definitely be returning!. I so enjoyed the spa, all the little touches the Hershey's kisses, the fruit infused water and the ice towels.  I loved that they had cold and hot Jacuzzis.  The music and the smells and the spa lady's rock! Worth the splurge it really does relax you!. My husband and I were traveling to the area for Spring Training and wanted to get a couples massage.  We were drawn to Hawaiian Experience Spa from the great Yelp reviews and the fact that they do Lomi Lomi massage.  

We started out experience with a steam, which was wonderful and loosened us up. My only comment on this is that it would be nice to have a timer or a clock or something in there because we had small window before our massage and I was worried we might go over so I don't think we stayed in there long.  As for our massage, we were in nice big room for the Lomi Lomi.  They put to massage tables together so you can really be next to your signifigant other (hold hands). I had BreAnna and she did a wonderful job on me. I told her medium pressure and that my lower back was a spot I wanted to concentrate on.  She listened to everything I had to say and really pinpointed spots on my body.  The lomi lomi really does feel like a wave of relaxation!  I wish I could find it in Denver!  

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place. It is a great place to relax!. Double-Double animal style with well-done animal style fries!  Need I say more?!. I don't live in Pittsburgh, but if I did I would buy food from here all the time. I bought homemade flour tortillas and made fajitas with which to enjoy them. They were fluffy and fat and so delicious. I wish I could buy these tortillas all the time! 
They had plenty of other specialty foods, so if you need some Mexican goods, this seems like the place. I really would love to try the tacos from the cart out front, too!. I live super close to this store and I've been in to browse previously but never purchased anything.  However, after taking a hiatus from running during my recent pregnancy, I realized I needed some new shoes to get me motivated again.  Enter iRun for a more serious visit!

The girls that helped me out were super knowledgeable and watched me walk to figure out what shoes to look at.  In the past, I've worn Adidas (which they don't carry at the moment), but I was open minded this time.  I've got small feet, size 6, and there wasn't much to choose form in my size during my visit, but just when I was about to give up, we found a great pair of Mizuno Wave Runners on the sale rack (50% off) that fit me perfectly - gotta love that!

In addition, I bought a few pairs of fabulous socks (Feetures! brand), and I still walked out of there spending less $$ than expected.

I like that iRun is locally owned and puts on some neighborhood fun runs and they also offer weekly running groups.  I'm a fan and would recommend going here next time you're in the market for running shoes, apparel, or accessories.. NOT a fan of the waiting. The hostess definitely unestimates the wait time. We were given a 20 minute estimate that ended up being nearly an hour. 

Definitely good food.  I think the food is on the right track, but the execution is lacking...  I was very reluctant to try the red velvet pancakes, since I thought they would be overly sweet, but they were delicious but could be more fluffy and and moist. Luckily the actual pancake wasn't too sweet so the whipped cream, chocolate chips and cream cheese sauce that topped it weren't too overpowering.  My omelette was cooked exactly as I requested and so were my potatoes.

Pleased with the experience overall. The waitstuff was friendly and efficient and the food came out in a timely fashion.

My only two major complaints were the long wait and less than welcoming hostess.  Those two things aside and this place might become a regular hangout for me if I can figure out when it's less busy, lol.. Go for lunch! You still get to enjoy the tasty meats and the quality for a fraction of the cost. 

We enjoy the prime rib dip on onion roll. The potato salad and fresh salads on the bar (complimentary with your sandwich) are very good, fresh and worthy of a second trip for more.

The service at Lawry's is unmatched which is saying a lot in the hospitality that Vegas offers. The dinner experience is always a must especially if you order the prime rib - be ready for a show :). Wow, decent Ballet in Phoenix...pinch me.

I have not been in the last year or so to one of the productions, but Ballet Arizona has been a treat under Ib Anderson's direction.  I'm a fan of the classical ballets and have loved their Swan Lake and Giselle productions.  This year's season is ending, so I must repent and make a few shows next year.. What a great breakfast spot! Everything was fantastic. Hashbrowns were perfectly crispy, bacon was cooked just right! Biscuits and gravy were out of this world!! Going back soon!!. Since moving back to California.. I have yet to find a hairstylist that could live up to my expectation. James have set the standard pretty high. He listens.. Knows how to give u want to want but also puts his own flare into it. I would be willing to drive a couple hours for him but i'm now about 10 hrs away. :/ 

Ladies and gents.. If you are looking for the best person in town for a cut.. He's your man!. Just moved recently and this place catered to my needs. I have 2 kids and they have a daycare center that would watch my kids while I worked out. I opted for the 6 month  membership and I thought the price was very reasonable. With that membership, the daycare center was free for up to 2 kids for up to 2 hours. The facility is managed really well (staff are helpful and friendly, bathrooms are spotless). The center has different  areas of interest (racketball, basketball, classes, mini  track, rock climbing). I have enrolled my kids to various classes that takes place in here as well. The instructors for various classes are really good and helpful. I would definitely recommend this place, especially if you have little ones. It is an ideal place to work out:). A New Year's Eve hot chocolate hunt brought myself and two friends here around 2am.

Although the place was pretty busy, we were seated almost immediately in a booth. It was only after being seated that I really got to take in the decor; total 1950's tin can diner from soup to nuts. The waitresses looked like they had just stepped out of Grease, there was a counter lined with stationary stools behind which you could see the cooks working away, and every booth had a mini jukebox where you could enter in songs that would play over the sound system. I loved it! Even more than that, our waitress was exceptionally attentive.

We got our orders put in not two minutes after being seated - two hot chocolates, a sprite, one Marilyn's Bread Pudding, and one Waffle Wonder. Our drinks came out first; my friend and I who each ordered the hot chocolate were at first delighted at how much whipped cream topped them off, but were quickly disappointed to find that the chocolate itself seemed to be made with water instead of milk. :(

Shortly after our beverages came our desserts. The bread pudding was devoured and got my bread pudding loving friend's seal of approval. The Waffle Wonder was shared, and as someone who doesn't like usually like sweet on sweet desserts I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it! The fudge, caramel, and whipped cream were straight out of my childhood, the fat scoop of vanilla ice cream was melting lusciouslly into the warm waffle, and the cinnamon was the perfect bit of spice.

Our waitress made sure to ask us if everything tasted okay a few minutes after dropping off our plates, and was right on time with the check once we finished. My short and sweet visit to this 5 and Diner was one of the most seamless experiences I had in Arizona. :). This place is just delightful. My coworker and I get lunch here almost weekly.  Unique Build your own sandwich or wrap with fresh quality ingredients at an extremely reasonable prices.  They're a smaller operation, open early in the morning through the lunch hours. Though a small space, they have a wide range of different teas and coffee drinks to suit your liking. I usually use the drive thru and always are greeted with a smile. :D  
Stop in at Cargo for your next coffee/lunch adventure.. I have visited the Pittsburgh Popcorn Company many times since I have moved to Pittsburgh. They are constantly changing flavors and post the flavors of the week on their websites as well as on a sign outside the store. Some unique flavors I've seen them make is dill pickle, buffalo chicken, and confetti. My favorite flavors are actually the classics which include kettlecorn and cheddar. They even allow you to mix and match flavors based on the size of the bag you want. Getting popcorn there is a great gift to give to your loved ones. I highly recommend the Oakland store because they are super nice and are not as busy as their other locations!. I have horrible issues with anxiety and going to the shrink exacerbates it instantly. That said, I was compelled to write this review resulting from a super positive experience. After two visits and four phone calls, I must say that my experience with this clinic was exemplary. I chose this office based on affordability and was blown away by them. Every single member of the staff was polite, efficient and helpful both on the phone and in person. Dr. Still was really easy to communicate with, which is extremely essential to my success in a psychiatrist/ patient relationship. In addition, he went out of his way to accommodate my budget given my lack of insurance. Lastly, he did something that is absolutely unheard of in a psychiatrist's office-- he strongly recommended several alternative treatment options and provided references from personal experience for each. Five stars!!. Great food and great service. I like going I. Friday nights, they have a Mexican band they play very good music great selection. Last time they had two players and they also played other music. It was a lot of fun went with a group and plenty of margaritas so tasty.  I like all the dishes especially their rice.. Met some friends here on a Friday night and the diet was off. But seriously worth the extra hour on the treadmill. We each had a different wine and everyone loved them. I started with a Pinot Grigio and moved to a Californian Pinot Noir. We ordered three trays of bruschetta to share and at $14 a plate we were all stuffed. Everything I had was great but the one with the figs was probably my favorite followed by the one w pistachios and one w salmon and pesto. Eating outdoors in Phoenix on a Friday night in February is a treat and the servers were truly on their game. It was a great night.  Y'all should go.. Broad selection of clothes, shoes, belts, handbags and jewelry. The staff was helpful but not intrusive. I purchased a silk scarf and a necklace and left content.. Honestly, you can't get much better than Hough's if you are a fan of delicious beer.  And oh, yes, delicious food.  But let's focus on the beer first.

Hundreds of options of every beer you can imagine from any region.  Many, many choices on tap but an unbelievable bottle selection.  And then do there darn tootin best to serve you the beer you choose in a glass tumbler bearing the name of said beer.  It's the little things that make places special.  

I've eaten here many times and have enjoyed crab cakes, burgers, wraps, and excellent appetizers.  Hough's has put Greenfield on the map.. I have seen Le Reve twice and I currently have tickets right now to see it again. For someone that is about to see this production for a third time, yes you guessed it, I am a fan! I even have the soundtrack so I guess that makes me a super fan!!

The La Reve theater is a beautiful one of a kind circular theater that was built just for this production. There is not a bad seat in the house. Because of the circular seating design, every time I see the show I get a whole new perspective, thus the show is always exciting to see again. 

For those that are comparing La Reve to a Cirque show, I feel that the Cirque show will come up short every time. Just go into it knowing that the translation for La Reve means "The Dream" and let yourself get lost in the show. I think you will come away impressed and amazed. 

For those that say the tickets are pricey, remember that you pay for what you get. 
This show is a must see if you are thinking about seeing a Vegas show. It is one of my all time favorites and I have seen a few Vegas shows, including: ( in no particular order) 
-Celine Dion
-Garth Brooks
-"O"
-The Beatles LOVE
-Absinthe
-Mamma Mia
-The Lion King
-Mystere
-Rock of Ages
-The Rat Pack
-Penn and Teller
-Jabbawockeez
-The Amazing Jonathan. Have stayed at the MGM many times but just came back from 3 nights at The Signature.  LOVED it.......beds/pillows are the most comfy & we have stayed all over Vegas.  Having a kitchen made it easy on our wallets.....breakfast in the suite before heading out & homemade sandwiches for our day at the pool was convenient. Their concierge & whole staff are extremely helpful.  Gym is very complete, they offer complimentary water.  Having Starbucks downstairs was great!  We stayed in Tower 1 & it was a 4-5 min walk to MGM pool.  Jetted tub (for 2) was so nice to soak in after walking so much.. I've brought my dog here since I adopted her in 2011. Every time I bring my dog to the vet she is scared and anxious but the staff takes extra time and care, they talk calmly to her and give her praise through out the exam. The vet always answer all of my questions, she spend extra time explaining things and never make me feel like we are rushed. I travel all over the USA and EVERY time we be needed vet records faxed to a new doggie day care they are always so helpful. A and E is the best so I make it a point to make our check ups and vaccinations at the times when we come back to town. Dr Lindsay is so wonderful she's always up beat cheerful, and I can tell she loves her job. she is great with dogs and people. I'm so thankful for her!!. We ate here for a late night snack. The hostess was not the warmest but they did get us seated in 15 minutes on a busy Friday night. Our waiter was welcoming and broughts chips and salsa immediately to the table. We ordered two appetizers (SHRIMP QUESADILLA and BEEF FLAUTAS), with very specific ingredient requests, and they were delicious. The food was hot, prepared as requested, and had a very nice presentation. Overall a great experience.. this is an awesome casual restaurant on vegas' old strip (which is being refurbished). it is located in the Container Center-so very cool. great fr families, singles and anyone really. The chef made my custom hot kale salad topped with an over easy egg and then he added sunflower seed, almonds, pumpkin seeds in a sherry vinegarette - too good forgot to take the pic. Also service was excellent too-that's Robin in the pic. The Perch is definitely a must when in the original vegas :). Love coming to this place when I'm in town! They have a great deli and carry a lot of craft beer that you can't find at other places. Employees are very friendly and helpful.. This is one of our favorite choices in movie theaters. 

First let's get the CON out of the way: it's expensive, make no mistake. 

But! The reserved VIP seating is a treat that we hope for when viewing a longer movie or when it's really crowded. And we also like to be able to meet in the lounge and chat before movie time. 

Concession is good, more expensive than most. 

Sound is good. Regular seats are good and movie options are generally most of the current big draws. Parking is good, too. 

Can't go wrong, just be ready with the $$$.. The food is always good here and the ambience is great. Half price bottles of wine on Tuesdays add to the experience. 

We had a great Malbec, eggplant/zucchini chips. The chips are awesome. I had pork belly souvlaki which was tasty. I only wish they'd mentioned it was on a whole wheat pita which has a very distinct taste I don't like. Greek 'fries' are good. We ended with baklava and ice cream. Delicious. 

Have liked this place since it opened on Providence years ago.. Just had them stretch and clean my carpets. Took the recommendations of yelp and couldn't be more pleased. Their whole operation is so professional. The work was done well and in a professional way. First rate.. Yume is Yummy!  Somebody probably already wrote that.  My Daughter treated us to dinner and we were blown away by the quality of sushi and bento boxes.  We are from Guam and Korean restaurants are amazing in the pacific and most are owned by families so our expectations are high.  I like others on Yelp have thought that to get a great korean meal you MUST go down to Chandler/Mesa do the trek and then get your fill of bulgogi or kalbi.  NOT TRUE!  If you are from Scottsdale or Phoenix - take the short drive to Promenade shopping area and get to Yume.  They are a small shop closest to the Triathlete shop sort of in the middle annex area.  

We had several different sushi platters, veggies, CA rolls, spicy rolls and then bentos. 
I couldn't resist the bulgogi - it came with salad, half of a lumpia (that's what we call them), a wonton, 2 cups of rice.  The bulgogi was shredded really small and thin which I'm not use to but the flavor was great.  We seemed to have a new server that didn't speak english so she would grab the other woman who moved so quickly it was hard to stop her to ask for what we needed.  

If you want fast korean food and sushi -- this is your place.  They have a clever way to order by using colored pencils and plastic menus that you check off like at a sushi bar.
They forgot my husband's octopus order but he was full any way so he didn't ask for it. 
They forgot my mochi ice cream but I was full so I decided against it.  Also, the mochi ice cream here cost less than another nearby vietnamese restaurant offering the same product.  

We cannot wait to go again!. I always have a great time here.  Their beer selection is top notch.  Service is always fast and friendly.  If you follow them on Twitter, you'll see all the specials (they were awesome during the Pirates season). 

I haven't had a chance to eat here yet, so I'll update my review once I do.  I've heard from trustworthy friends that the food is also excellent, so be sure to try James St!. Work related event and bringing the family. Two games of bowling and food, good people and family.
This place is good to go bowling during the week close to home not crowded. 
We had food delivered from TGIF's it was pretty good the only down fall was they did not bring enough plates and they forgot the ranch for the salad and the chicken.
All was good played 3 games and had a good night.. After a hugely disappointing visit to another big name Bakery on my visit to Vegas I was delighted to find that Bouchon have some delicious baked items. This is more of a kiosk than a store as it is really small with nowhere to sit so expect to take your items and have a Picnic somewhere. 

Strawberry Cupcake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bouchon-bakery-las-vegas#m-ephjyQMcsBL_BPFRv0PA) - $4. Beautiful decoration, it was a shame to ruin it. Also filled with the same smooth Strawberry Frosting that topped it. The cake was moist and fresh. Not too sweet. 

Raspberry Macaron (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bouchon-bakery-las-vegas#nZv_HpLb1GcjyvyX4nHTsA) - $3.25. Not your regular sized Macarons, these are in steroids! Seriously, they are the size of the palm of my hand. This wasn't quite so fresh by the time I got around to eating it (completely my fault) but still tasted great. Crisp outside, chewy center. A little too light on flavor for my liking.

Other items found here include Pastries, Cookies, Mini Cakes, Tarts and Pudding cups as well as Drinks. 

*TIP*
Dine at Bouchon restaurant , bring your receipt here and you will get 25% off of your purchase.. The crepes are really, really good! I tried the Nutella and banana combo and it was delicious. The crepes are pretty large, and could be shared. I thought they had a nice menu of both savory and sweet crepes. 

The service was friendly and fast. I felt the prices were reasonable $5-8 for a crepe. And I actually liked the location,  it was a great set-up if you have little ones. 

We will be back!. I'll preface this by saying that I've gone a lifetime refusing to learn anything about how the human body functions - easily horrified by things involving fluids, organs, etc. So.., I had a great experience with PV Ob/Gyn. Dr Newman was my gynecologist for 3 years, and I never really wanted to get pregnant. I will be forever grateful that he was my doctor when I did unexpectedly (but happily.) I was an Advanced Maternal Age expectant mom whose husband had just moved to a new state for a new job 9 days before I found out I was pregnant. Just a tad bit of anxiety... Dr. Newman was awesome - easing my fears, counseling me on prenatal testing, telling me no more than I wanted to know, and constantly making me laugh. 

My delivery had some complications, and I was in tears in the delivery room. When Dr. Newman walked in, I breathed a sigh of relief. As much as he jokes, he's all business when it comes down to delivery. He visited me twice after birth and as I struggled with breastfeeding (tongue tied baby), he was incredibly encouraging and again, made me laugh when I was on the verge of tears. 

After an emotionally difficult pregnancy and scary (for me) delivery, I'm so grateful to have had the perfect doctor for me. His dry humor might not be for everyone, but I give as good as I get... Either way, he's the doctor you want in your delivery room - competent, knowledgeable, and committed to bringing your baby safely into the world.. Love this place love the food on marylin cafe and specially that is open 24 hours love the room and they are really cheap I would recommend this place to my family and friends. I was happy to see the buy one get one 1/2 off signs. Upon walking in, I was pleasantly greeted by Ashley. The store is bright clean and organized. Found a pai if Jessica Simpson shoes at a great close out sale price and another pair on regular sale. Ashley was my checkout person and once again she was happy and pleasant...I will shop here again. I'm playing a Puerto Rican New Yorker in a play and need to have a little tan. I'm used to tanning outside because I live in sunny LA so I hadn't gone to a tanning salon in 6 years! So when I got there today, I didn't know what I was doing. I had seen good reviews on Yelp for Southside Tan and Massage and it's close to where I'm staying, so I tried it out. What a wonderful experience! Right when I walked in, it smelled good. Everything was clean and neat, there was happy, light music playing and the girl at the front desk, Haley, was delightful! She was warm and friendly, and made me feel comfortable. She walked me through what I should do and answered any of my questions. Once I was on my own, I still managed to push the buttons incorrectly and had to go back downstairs and ask for more help! She smiled, simply reset the machine, and I was tanning in no time! I appreciate people who interact without judgement and Haley did exactly that. I bought 5 sessions and will be back next week!. Its opeeennnnnnnnn. yayyyyyyyyyyy. I no longer need to go to New Jersey for it. Hehe.

Andres had noooo idea what he was doing at the register. Missed up my order 3 times after I told him to repeat my order. Smh. Anyways. They JUST open. So its whatever,  i understand you're learning still.

The pasta was wayyy to oily. :/
My spinach power salad was decent, but my Mediterranean sandwich was delicious. :) the pesto sauce was perfect. I was happy.

Tropical hibiscus is a mustttttttt for your meal fyi. :))

I shall come back.. I love their food!  Their pizza is yum, their calzones are yum, their fingers & wings...mmm.  You wouldn't guess from the outside that they'd actually have decent food.  Their remodel did make it look a lot better on the inside though.  My office orders lunch from here often and it's a little pricey for pizza and wings but well worth it!. We had a very pleasant experience at Ground Control. We had a large party and we were able to find comfortable seating the moment we walked in (6:00 pm on a Saturday night). The waiter was very attentive and took our order immediately. The drinks arrived quickly and the food shortly thereafter. Most of us had wine flights and the selection of wine was very good. My husband and I shared a cheese plate and we loved it! The selection of cheese was excellent and was served with a fig compote, dried apricots and walnuts which highly complimented the selection. The price of the food and drinks was reasonable as well. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because the interior could use some sprucing up. All in all this is a great neighborhood spot! We love it and we will be back!. A Gem in Downtown Las Vegas! The Perfect spot to have a cocktail and a great dinner overlooking downtown. It's best to make reservations. I recommend Nicky's Chicken & Artichokes or Joey C's Filet Mignon.. Excellent food great fresh fish and fun environment ! Had the ceviche, pulled pork tacos,shrimp tacos and ahi tuna. Will Definetly come back. *UPDATE*

A few things I forgot to include on the first post. One: this place smells really good inside, not like the chemicals of most. Two: They offer free wifi (huge plus to those of us that don't have unlimited anymore!) Three: They offer complimentary water and select sodas and again don't make you feel like you're putting them out by asking for one. Four: Colors and tips galore!! I mean seriously. Any color and/or print you want is available here in regular polish, gel, or even a HUGE selection of awesome tips for full sets. 

I've now been back twice since my first visit. The first time was just the next day because I smudged the polish on my two big toes and got an eyebrow wax. Both were FANTASTIC! They sat me down and fixed the polish (free of charge) right away (and without making me feel uncomfortable). 
The eyebrow wax was seriously the best I've received out here. I laid down and she waxed them, then tweezed the few remaining hairs and even trimmed it (which I was SUPER impressed with - other places never do this). 

Today I went for a fill (a little early but I won't be able to make it next week). I walked in and got helped right away. I showed them (again) another picture from a different salon and they did it without a question. Super happy again and this is definitely my new 'go to' nail salon for nails, pedi, and waxing! 

And again I think they are EXTREMELY reasonable price-wise for what you get!. Have been in several times and they def quench my taste for a yummy bite of sweetness! Super cute and nice to have the shop local. Yummm! Keep up the good work :)

I have tried several of the flavors and LOVE the toasted marshmallow icing the best.. Holy beer bar!  So many to choose from, many with witty names and from local breweries.  I stuck with Belgian ales - creamy and delicious.  Food here is pretty darn good - lots of variety and tasty as heck.. Pear cider sangria to die for! Fabulous ambiance, and super nice knowledgeable staff. Killed 2 hours surfing net and drinking sangria, and wishing I was hungry. Will definitely eat here when I'm back through Pittsburgh!. The wait was a bit long but well worth it!! Not sure of the piercers name but he was patient and professional!  He fully explained everything he was doing and i really appreciated that.. I went here with my boyfriend last night.  We opted for the happy hour on the patio.  I really liked that the happy hour runs all night long.  And they got great prices! $5 glasses of wine and cocktails.  My boyfriend got the big burger for only $10 he said it was good but he likes other burgers from other places better. I Got the fish tacos, the fish was really tasty, but the tortillas were cold.that's the reason why I gave it a 4 star instead of 5. I got to say I loved our server; she was very nice and attentive.. This place is great!  So happy to have a solid grocery store and chaat place in Central Phoenix.  Good chaat, mithai (sweets), and other delights.  Usually fresh jalebis too :).  For Diwali they had really nice milk sweet mithais that tasted homemade to me.  The thalis are great; especially the chicken tikka one.   I haven't tried the pizza, but it sounds good.  The vegetarian thali/meal selection is decent but not quite as good as Little India.  The grocery store is small but they have the necessities: spices, dhals, rice, attas, frozen foods, namkeens, Indian beauty supplies, etc.  The folks who work here are nice and helpful in finding grocery items.  Best part: when I was there today I saw some buffet equipment and when I inquired I was told they are going to open a full restaurant in the back!  Woo hoo can't wait!!!. We absolutely love this place! The pineapple curry is out of this world and the prices are great. The serving sizes are large enough to share and then have some left over. Love this place :). I went here with my parents and my son (he's 25) a few nights ago.  We have been to many of these in Mexico so we knew what to expect.  First and for most...the staff is superb.  They've only been open a month but they all seem to enjoy it and did the stage dancing and singing like old timers.  The manager Michael was so professional and nice, while being fun.  My dad had on an original señor frogs t shirt from decades ago. The manager loved it and brought us an amazing dessert.  Then he was on the stage with his servers dancing.  It was great.  The food service was fast and the drinks were strong, I had a daiquiri. The food is mediocre but who goes there for the food???  You go for the fun and atmosphere.  Drinks by the yard, singing on the stage and the Congo line.  I had the bacon wrapped shrimp...it was ok.  Son had the chicken sandwich and fries...he enjoyed it.  Dad had nachos and mom tacos....both were also enjoyed.  For Vegas the price is reasonable.  Great place for parties like bachelorette, etc, but wouldn't bring young kids (and there were a few in there ).  Also nice outside seating (less boisterous) with w good view.  I will definitely go back.  Thanks mike the manager for making the night so fun for my dad.. Driving into downtown Glendale - I felt like I was cheating on my beloved Haus Murphy's. I secretly promised I would venture back to the area soon to visit Haus, but I soon recovered from my guilt when I tasted the Bruschette. Delicious. This place is really great! The pizza very tasty, we had the Stallion pizza - or the meat pizza. It was a little spicy and very meaty. So great. Also very inexpensive. (26 before tip for one pizza, one appetizer and two sodas, dinner for two). The sodas are also great - bottled coke products (1 liter bottles). Highly recommend. (We will be going back to Haus in the next week . . . and also back for pizza soon!). This place is amazing! The milkshakes and chocolates are delicious! I always order the Oreo shake. My mother had the Cookie Dough fudge and loved it! My friend gave the hot fudge shake a try and loved it as well! My only complaint is that the shakes are a little pricey. $4.50 is a little much for a 16 oz shake. Other than that, delicious milkshakes!. Phat Phrank's was a lovely lunch spot.  It's a simple restaurant a little off the strip but WELL WORTH the trip!  The fresh guacamole had ample amounts of avocado and is seasoned just right.  The braised pork  (adobada) is super flavorful with a little bit of a bite.  Their hot sauce spices it up nicely.  The fish tacos were on point.  Lightly fried fish, home-made creamy sauce, and loads of fresh cabbage and green onions made the perfect combo on a soft corn tortilla.  Hubby usually doesn't like fish tacos, but he blessed these, and added an extra to his order.  We're giving this a five because you get really GOOD food and SOLID service.  I'll be back!  If I lived around here, it would be a regular lunch spot for me.  :). I love this movie theater!  It is clean and comfortable!  But the BEST thing EVER --- they have a child care!!!  Grown ups can drop their kid's into the child care for $6 per kid while they go and watch a grown-up movie.  Now, if they just served wine I would be a very happy momma!. I went with my husband and 17 year old and 10 year old.   We had a great time, it was very relaxed, no pressure like there is on the golf course.    Scott greeted us when we got there and was so nice and down to earth.   He gave us helpful tips on our shots but did it in a way where one would not feel intimidated or offended.   He just offered some tips and if we wanted to ask for more help, he was right there.  He makes you feel very comfortable with the game of golf. The simulator equipment also had a moving platform that made it very realistic.   When you were on a hill the platform would adjust as if you were really shooting off of a hill, very cool.    Overall this is a five star because of the excellent customer service, relaxed environment, we had a fun time, no pressure and even the kids enjoyed it!   Also, sure beats the heat..... Looking forward to going back soon, especially when the real heat hits AZ.   P.S. They are expanding their simulator stations soon so it will be even bigger and better.   One downfall, I never knew it was there.... somewhat hidden. Watch Groupon for deals.. I really enjoyed the crepes that Agnus prepared for my family and I.  Really great customer service and delicious food! Unfortunately we live in Texas but if I ever return to Vegas I'm definitely stopping by here again!. While we are new to the club, I am very impressed with the wide variety of classes and times offered and what appears to be great child care and my son took his first swim lesson there today which is very affordable considering what we paid for other swim classes.  Excited to check out the fitness classes that are included in the price for my four-year-old and for myself. My husband plans to use the weights more than the classes and we went for the family membership. Gorgeous play pools to take the kids. Lap lanes and master swim team for adults. An all-around awesome gym for families/couples/singles. You can even enjoy a healthy lunch or spa treatment while your kids play in the childcare or take a class just for a nice break. If you're currently an at-home parent, this place is like a dream come true for giving everyone a break and for getting in fitness while caring for young  kids. My only complaint is that it is not cheap but you get a lot with the membership.. Thank You Al !!!  We finally have REAL Chicago Food---Awesome Italian Beef and Hot Peppers!  

For us transplanted Chicagoans... this is fast food nirvana!

After watching Food Wars on Travel Channel, I regretted the fact that I lived in an area with NO Portillos, Buona Beef, Al's Beef or Mr. Beef around. I don't care that Al's came in 2nd to Mr Beef on Food Wars-- I prefer Al's flavor. 

We have a real contender in Al's...The place is brand spanking new, cool graphics on the walls (for us native Chicaaaahhhgoans), and the menu goes far beyond standard Italian beef. It's tough to make choices when the REAL Vienna hot dog bun packages are staring me in the face.
We will go back...and often... to check out the burgers, dogs and chicken too. And oh yeah... the BEST fries anywhere!. I have been going to True Rest Float Spa for about 6 months.  I get so busy in life that I could not get any good sleep and I was always sore.  Since going to True Rest, I have noticed better energy, I sleep better and my joints are not as sore.  I truly love that now I can use my own music while in the pod as well if I choose.  This place with the salt therapy has really been amazing for me.  I always wanted to go visit the Dead Sea for it's health benefits, so this place is the next best thing!. I have only one complaint about Brio, but it is really not their fault that the bar gets filled up too quickly to enjoy Happy Hour!! Other than that, you get great delicious food for under $4 dollars during Happy Hour!!! The beef Carpacio, the fried ravioli, the flat bread pizzas and the spicy shrimp with fried eggplant are highly recommended. Beautiful atmosphere and inviting "al fresco" patio dinning with fire pits. I have been here too many times to count (parties, happy hour, lunch and dinner service) but have always had great food and service!! Speaking of service, I once slipped and fell as I entered the bar area. I was more embarrassed than hurt. In fact, I was fine. But the wait staff and a couple patrons rushed to my aide. Their concern for my well being was very touching!! The Manger gave me her card and insisted I call her if I needed to seek medical treatment due to my fall at Brio. Happy to report I was fine and I did  not need to seek medical attention. It took longer to recover from the humiliation of the fall than the pain from the fall itself...lol!!. Remember where cookie shop was located on Bower Hill near the post office? Well, it's now a bakery/cafe. The inside is newly remodeled (complete with granite countertops) and very clean. There are a few places to sit and eat in the front part of the shop near the counter. But the larger section of tables is in the back room. 

The chalkboard menu consists of:  the left side with a huge list of coffees and other beverages, the middle with a list of all the sweet treats from cookies to brownies, cupcakes, scones, cakes and more, the right side lists sandwiches and the soup of the day. 

I ordered a ham, gouda, apple on a pretzel bun for lunch and sweet treats to go. The sandwich was prepared in the back and brought out to me on a tray. My sweet treats - salted caramel brownie, blueberry muffin and apple cinnamon scone were placed in a lovely white box. In addition to all of the sweets that are on dispay, there was also a display of chocolate barks which were already bagged. 

The quality of everything I tasted was very good. The only exception was that the scone was a bit hard the next day. The prices were VERY reasonable. Overall, this is a wonderful place to grab lunch or some baked goods. I'm sure I will be back soon.. Sometimes, I hate being a girl. Like when you go into a hardware store and describe the doohickey that attaches to the thingie, and you get this look of pity from the staff.  I never have to worry about that at this Ace. The are always friendly, I can explain what I'm trying to do and wave random broken parts at them, and someone will figure it out.  Even if the person I find isn't the right person, they will make sure you get taken care of.. The DI is the best!  I come here to shop when I feel discouraged or blue.  Something about the spirituallity of the LDS church members rubs off on me and I begin to feel my spirits pick up.  Good people are good people, and the workers are wonderful.

I like their slogan:  "Give stuff a second chance."  Well, we all need a second chance and so on those blue days I come here and I leave feeling pretty good, and with some few tchotchke's that cost me a couple of dollars.

My kitchen is filled with awesome cookware that I use everyday.  It is really a very special place and I bring all my gently used and clean things here to donate when I am ready to pass them on.  Yeah for the DI!  thank you !!. We absolutely love this place!!!! I love the atmosphere and the staff is very friendly!!!!! But most of all I love the food!!!!. wow this theater is pretty big and nice! Saw the Muse concert here this past Saturday and it has very clean restrooms and a different concession stands - even though my bf had VIP tickets to the lounge with complimentary dinner, I still noted that they had a good selection of concession stands because they had Cold Stone Creamery and that's rare that I see that in venues - at least the ones that I have been to. But of course the prices are still high - but options are nice. The complimentary dinner that came with the VIP Tickets - not sure if it was part of the venue or not but it was pretty darn good  all you can eat  three types of meatballs, there was salad, bread, vegetable quesadilla and grilled mozzarella caprese. 

Our seats were on the front row on the left side of the stage - super duper close! Nice to be able to overlook the pit at such a close range. the seats weren't too bad to sit on but we stood most of the time anyways. 

Overall everything was pretty awesome - Muse, food, company and venue.. Came in to visit a friend. Service was good and the waiters and hostess very kind. Unfortunately this place wont be open for long. The cafe business isn't doing well in the casino area-. Charlie's + 3-4-1 Sundays = F-M-L Mondays

In my entire life, this is the only place I've been to that entertains the idea of a 3-4-1 special. Is that even legal under Arizona laws? No wonder there are so many cabs that pull in and out of this place. You could definitely drink comfortably for a great price knowing you're only a step away from a taxi. 

I also enjoy the drag show they have after the special... at whatever time I usually start putting down my drinks. If my blurry memory serves me right, the deal ends at 7, so the show might start around 8. The people here are pretty friendly, except for the one who stole my 3 day old Jimmy Choo sunglasses. I probably wouldn't have lost them if I was allowed to bring in my purse, though. Thanks Charlie's!  

There is also always a volleyball game going on outside in their sand court if you're the sporty type. 

I've also been here on a Saturday night, but I think that's typically when men are on the prowl, so I didn't really sense a casual, patio-drinking type of atmosphere. I'll stick with the bane of my F-M-L Mondays.. Excellent cappuccinos  - always warm service, reminds me of Italy. Nice outside chairs and tables , cozy inside.  I've grown attached to it.  Bonus is homemade takeaway dinner portion pasta, sauces, meatballs etc at reasonable prices right next door!. I have been to the Camelback location - This place has a serious selection and great prices!! 
I usually visit pre-season ( NOW!) or post-season for the best deals on pants, hats and gloves - some of the necessities that I am not too picky about.
I visit here to get my daughter's snowboard pants (every year!!) She's growing like a weed so our friends are getting great hand-me-downs in the meantime!!. Being huge fans of Binkley's, our curiosity piqued at the idea of a more casual fare version close-by. Living in the far northwest valley, the idea of driving to Cafe Bink was more enticing than trekking all the way to Old Scottsdale where most of the new and upcoming restaurants feel "safe" to demo their breakthrough culinary techniques.

Casual, the restaurant stands. You walk in and the hostess desk is right at the entryway. There's barely room for people to wait unlike the living room style sitting area at Binkley's. Bar or table? A grand scale bar in rich woods claims the left side while  a narrow row of tables hugs the right side. 

No cocktail list. I felt like a baby bird first being shown how to fly. I had to order cocktails on my own volition without any written guidance of what words sounded the most tantalizing for some bartender's new take on a classic. This restaurant keeps it simple. I ordered my favorite "go-to," an Old Fashioned and loved it so much that I ordered a few. My hubby ordered a beer, but I can't remember what it was. What a girl I am, because I can only recall that it was served in a beer glass that was adorned with the name "Bink's" in a whimsical font.

Calamari. Flavorful and seasoned lightly with no frills. Batter light and flaky but hardly messy. Tender, not chewy.

Pulled to Order Mozzerella - served with a trio of dips. Red onion marmalade sounds crazy, but it actually worked. The red onion did not counter the sweetness of the marmalade at all. The pesto was very familiar in taste and good. The tomato jam was tart and sweet and also produced an interesting likable flavor with the cheese. 

Trout Meunière -Served with haricots verts (French green beans), toasted almonds, lemon brown butter. Meunière simply refers to the fish being lightly floured and then sautéed. The taste is light, inviting, and savory. I often seen green beans paired with buttery trout and if you eaten both together, you'd know why, because they compliment each other well!

Bacon burger - Although burgers seem foolproof, I've had some pretty interesting ones to put it nicely. However, the bacon burger here is as expected, cooked to perfection (well at least the one I tried that my hubby ordered). Juicy and flavorful and not overdone. My hubby always goes for the road less traveled when it comes to food, but for this dinner, he was craving a burger. Whether you're more food adventurous or like to keep food simple, this burger will more then satisfy that craving!

If you see something on the menu that is "out of the ordinary" then I suggest you try it, because chances are it'll be more interesting to let your taste buds take a tour rather than feeding them a monotony of the same foods over and over again. Cafe Bink is a fun place to try!. Excellent lunch! Limited menu for lunch, but I find that refreshing. Everything fresh and local. I had a very good Arizona Stronghold white wine, Tyro?. Then a plate with apple sausage, crispy grilled bread, fennel apple salad with a tangy light dressing, and homemade applesauce. Wonderful mix of flavors, complementary yet different. Quick friendly service, and pleasant ambience.. Great at all hours especially when you are hungry at midnight !!!. Mostly bookstore but part quirky gift shop, Changing Hands gives the independent bookstore a good name time and time again. 

First things first, it shares a parking lot with a Trader Joe's, so if you've ever been to a TJ's you know what it's like to almost have your life snuffed out by someone speeding a Prius through the lot in a quest to get what may be the last box of frozen vegan lasagna. It's a dangerous parking lot by nature, so just...be careful. 

Otherwise, this is a prime local shopping experience. Outside (at least for now) is a pretty extensive sale rack of used books. I picked up a bestseller that has yet to be converted into paperback (I've been holding out for over a year now!) from that rack and saw some other pretty decent reads with good pricing.

Inside is a mix of used and new books, the used books nestled into the shelves with the new books like prizes waiting to be found. They have a good selection of cookbooks and memoirs, mostly what I come in for. Along with books they have your usual bookstore staples like greeting cards and calendars as well as quirky gift items like snarky magnets, tea sets, candles (Voluspa brand for those of you who are as obsessed as I am), and artisan-looking purses.

They have a nice little loyalty card program-every $10 you spend gets you a stamp on your stamp card and 10 stamps=$10 dollars to spend on the house.

I like CH for the simplicity of what it is: a good old independent bookstore. I will never get on board with e-readers because there is something special about books that just doesn't translate on a screen. CH channels that, magic if you will, and shares it with the community in their own unique way. 

There's something for everyone here, so this is a store that can be enjoyed by book nerds and non-book nerds alike!. Best Taco's and Ceviche love the homemade corn tortillas this place never dissapoints. The Service is always excellent very friendly and welcoming.. I love this place! The food is delicious but the customer service makes this place really special. Abraham and Gina are so nice and knowledgeable. I haven't tried their lunch menu yet but dinner is outstanding.. Now where is that six star button? Honestly, a couple months ago my husband and I spent an entire day with the owner, Johanna, literally designing, molding, and creating each other's wedding bands from scratch. 

Yes, you heard me right. We MADE each other's wedding bands. Three words: Best. Date. Ever.

We chose to make ours in sterling silver (I'm allergic to gold), but you can also make gold rings as well. In a matter of 5 hours, we turned a couple beads of silver into two gorgeous wedding bands. Johanna was amazing, and walked us through every step. She made herself totally available for the whole day and was so helpful and patient. We knew nothing about the process, and not only did she show us what to do, but she explained why we did it that way. My husband made me a small, delicate braided band, and I made him a very masculine band with comfort grip and a matte finish. Both turned out flawless and stunning, thanks to all of the support from the owner. There are also options to set stones in the rings, but for now we're sticking with the beautifully simple bands that our friends and family are always oohing and aahhing at. Plus, who else can say that they literally made their significant other's ring with their bare hands?

Harold Studio also offers classes, which I am dying to try! Some of the jewelry they make out there is amazing. They are even making dog tags this season! So creative!

All around a great date, a learning process, and excellent products that we will cherish for the rest of our lives!. I usually stay with friends when I am in town, but since I had family staying in the hotel I decided to get a room myself.  I must say I was shocked what I got for the money.  

When you first enter the door, the curtains open and music starts to play.  I'll take that kind of welcome any day.  To my surprise, my room was cleaned everyday despite my abnormal sleeping schedule (it IS Vegas after all).  

The Casino staff and bartenders were friendly and the floor was clean.  Bottom line is that I'd surely stay again.  :). Mono was,awesome!!! He really made our experience great..he suggested a sake that was,exactly wat we were looking for. Loved it! We will b back! :). I love this QT!  I usually don't eat the roller dogs but the spicy chicken are the bomb. The heat then up so hot and they always keep plenty on the rollers.  I guess a guilty pleasure. 

Outside of that, clean & fast...just the way I need it.. I was a little scared to stay here after reading all the bad reviews. I stayed here for EDC & the room was nice & clean!! House keeping was great. Check-in/out was fast & pain free! Great hotel.. Last week I did the 5 Day Detox and it was awesome!  One of the things I discovered is that I eat way more in a day than my body truly needs.  There were times during the day when I would have normally had a snack out of habit, but wasn't truly hungry.  I loved starting  each day with a green smoothie.  It was plenty of nutrients to get me to lunch and my energy throughout the day was sky high.  There were times I did feel a bit hungry in the afternoon, but that was just my reminder to drink more water...after I did, the hunger was satisfied.  Overall, I lost 5 1/2 lbs in 5 days.  I really felt the biggest difference in my stomach...nice and flat.  This is the right way to do a detox -  raw, organic and with whole foods!. I love Bella Nails!  I go there for my gel manicures, gel and regular pedicures.  The male owner and his wife are super nice.  They remember what I like and since I am now 8 months pregnant, they treat me as if I am going to break and I LOVE IT!  I feel pampered and always leave with a smile! =). Great farmer's market. There aren't that many stalls but of the ones there, everything is of good quality and price. 

I would recommend getting your fruits and veggies, and remember to save money for some cheap fresh flowers and a little something from the baker's stand. 

I never wake up early enough, so by the time I get there the meat guy and the shrimp guy are all out. Not great for people who like to sleep in but it's motivation to try some day.. We made the rounds and went to several breweries over the weekend. We split a flight at Sycamore. My favorite was the vanilla beer, it just had the slightest hint of vanilla without being syrupy. It was pretty crowded but the bar staff helped us right away despite being busy and they labeled the beers in the flight for us which was considerate. Nice place, I would definitely go back again.. Yummm we saw this place just walking around waiting for O back in Feb 2012 and when we came back Aug 2012 we made it a point to try to find it again and try it.   It was pretty good.  Wish I could've gotten more than just a crepe to share with my bf but next time I will take some lil treats back home for my family.. Stayed here for a Hockey Tournament.  It was a great experience.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  They always had a smile on their face.  Breakfast was good and had many choices, eggs, bagels, muffins, cereal, walffles, buscuits and gravy,  coffee and juice.  The staff helped each other out especially in the front of the hotel (front desk and breakfast area).  This was nice to see the teamwork.  

I gave it four stars because the rugs were stained pretty bad and the shower head was broken some.  It was still working.  The rooms were clean with the exception of the stains.  

Great Job!  I appreciate the friendly atmosphere.  Our hockey team was here and I know they could be a little loud and rambunctious.  The quote above the front door read, "May all who enter as guest, leave as friends."  You can see how they strive for this.. I really enjoyed the food! Ordered the Pad Thai (medium) and it was pretty hot anything beyond medium and I wouldn't be able to taste my food.

They played soothing music that made me want to get a massage. The reason for the four rating and not five is due to following:

After getting our food we were not acknowledged nor were our drinks filled. They past by several times and we tried to grab their attention and they kept walking by. After finishing our food they did not come to our table for about 15 minutes. 

Other than that everything was good jus lacking on the service side.. You defiantly get what you pay for- but it's Vegas and you shouldn't be spending much time in the room anyways! I'm 22 and came with my mother that's 57 and we both really enjoyed ourselves. Our flight got in early and the hotel had no problem holding our bags until a room became available. They always seem to have promotions so look out for those when booking. We were given 2 free drinks by the pool and a buy one get one free for a show there. The pool was nicer than expected but there are a few kids around. There is an adult only area that is pretty unoccupied. The location is at the far end of the strip but you would be wise to invest in shuttle passes that pick up across the street in MGM Grand. In all, the Excalibur fit our needs and I'd have no problem going back!. Beautiful wee wine bar underneath George IV Bridge. Had I not been to another bar on the same street a couple of weeks ago I may have had trouble finding it. I went there last night for a pre-dinner drink and had an Aperol Spritz (a popular aperitivo drink in Italy at the moment). It cost £5 which I thought was quite fair as it has both liqueur and Prosecco in it and was made correctly, which does not happen in many bars in Edinburgh from my experience! We were also given a sharing plate with bread sticks, parmesan and olives at no extra cost which was a nice touch. I am definitely going to return sometime to sample some of their Italian wines and bar food.. My girlfriend and I love trying  new resturants and we usulaly check yelp as a resource. We visited the resturant about a month ago and we really enjoyed how friendly the staff and owners were. They were attentive and the food was mostly really good. The Chicken Scarpara was our favorite. We tried the handmade Ravioli and it was also good but the Chicken Scarpara was excellent it was not a dish either of us has had before and we love spicy and it had a kick to it. In fact I am planning on meeting another firend there tomorrow night and taking my husband this time too. Nice to see a local resturant that greets and meets their customers. As a Persoanl Chef myself I believe ti makes all the difference the presentation and the feeling of the resturant and of course the quality of the food.. This food is so delicious.  Especially their salads and tortilla soup!  Use the coupons when they get delivered to your mail.  Only makes the experience even better.. Love Dutch Bros coffee. They actually know how to make some drinks that stump Starbucks people. I wish they had some indoor seating (or at least power outlets) though, and wifi. I'd hang out here more. Most of my time spent waiting is because the baristas are chatty with everyone. I don't mind it so much but when you're in a hurry, it can be annoying. Also, I posted a picture of one of the employees having a meeting with another. I don't know who they are, other than workers, since they at least have the tshirt. Dude's showing crack. Of all the tables and seats he could have picked, he picked the one that shows me his back. Gross and unprofessional. I get you're trying to be hip and cool but have some class too. A belt and better fitting shirt isn't gonna kill your cool look. Also, be aware of your surroundings and sit so you don't present your crack to customers, much less female ones.

Too long of wait times, no indoor seating/power outlets/wifi, and employee showing crack lost you a star on this review guys. Other than that, I like your coffee, the convenience of this location, and your dog-friendly ways. (I saw a guy with his dog and they gave them a doggy treat. It's corporate-wide I guess!). Best PTs in town. I went here for a Paintnite event w/ my girl friend and the service was great. Our waitress was very attentive and always made sure we were taken cared of. I've been to a Paintnite event before; at a different venue but by far PTs hosted it better b/c of their wonderful hospitality. I will definitely come back here on a regular night.. Another excellent experience with Robert, Jason and the hard working staff at Fletchers on crismon! These guys over deliver every time. Today I even got $25.00 toward future services as a patron gift. I trust them and they are the only honest automotive business I have come across. Plus they get me out before time quoted so i can get on with my day. Thanks guys see ya next time.. Dr. Rob is great!!  He was able to get my sister in to see him (she was visiting from out of town) at the last minute and was able to diagnose her problem in less than a minute.  She has already felt relief in less than 3 hours and we are so grateful.  His staff is super friendly and professional.  So glad that they are close by!!  Thanks Rob!!!. I have to say that because of the price (less than $30 per month for full car wash with wax, special tire cleaning, air freshener, towel wipe and free vacuum), my husband and I are hooked. Also, each and every guy that works there are the friendliest and most professional I have ever seen. Keep up the good work you guys. You're the best.. It's good but not extraordinary. Service is always great, food is always made fast. It's definitely better than your average pizza, but compared to some of the pizza out there, I've become desensitized to gourmet pizza.. So I had quite a hard time deciding whether or not to give this hotel 3 stars or 4 stars, but I ended up going with 4 stars based on the things that the hotel provided for people just staying in the hotel.

I really don't have many complaints regarding the hotel at all. The casino was kept very clean and had a nice open feel that kept you from feeling like you were a sardine. The only thing sucked about the casino was the smell of smoke, but that's not something you can avoid. The pools that I did see were awesome, but I didn't get a chance to go to the "toptional" pool ($30 admission to "toptional" pool). 

The rooms were amazing. Huge windows overlooked different parts of Vegas and the rooms were kept very clean and fresh. The bathrooms were very spacious and sported a huge soaker tub and a large glass shower. The biggest selling point for the bathrooms were the (slightly-outdated) TV's they had mounted that you could see from the tub. One small drawback to the room is that all the doors make a ton of noise, so there is no way to quietly move around the room without waking up the other people in your room. Also, the toilets make as much noise as those found on an airplane, so make sure you use the toilet prior to anyone going to sleep.

The part that almost made them give me give them a 3 star review is the way they handled the business conference I was part of. Our first meetings were at 7:45am (not that early) and all 200 of us had to eat and be seated between 7:30 and 7:45. Well the hotel only has one restaurant and a Starbucks that are open before 7:00am and the hotel apparently didn't warn the restaurant that we were coming because they were only staffed with 2 waitresses. My company completely overwhelmed the starbucks because the restaurant wasn't moving fast enough. 

Conferences aren't anything special and they really need to figure out how to handle that kind of capacity. Besides the business conference side of things, the hotel is overall wonderful and a great place in Vegas.

Tip: Go to their House of Blues restaurant. It's delicious!!! See my review :). I loved this place.
Came here on a business dinner, and everyone loved the patio dining.
The food and wine were both great, and the dessert... OMG.... salted caramel bread pudding?  YES YES YES!!!!. A wonderful neighborhood delight..owners are warm and friendly..everything we have eaten was delicious. A wonderful addition for mcCormick Ranch.. Although Bada Boom highlight's it pasta room, it should definitely be included in the top pizza places in the Phoenix area.  It's outdoor patio is very charming and the service was good.  As an added bonus my friends and I  had no wait on a Saturday around seven... This place is pretty pricey, but worth the money.  The food was great!  The elevator up was kind of confusing because when you get up there the doors open up to the kitchen.  The service was very friendly and helpful.. Wow, my roomate took me here when I first moved to Arizona several months ago. I was impressed! The food was awesome, the decor really cute, and they have a cute bar that serves alcoholic beverages. I loved my eggs benedict and would love to return here again sometime soon!

Cheers. Four friends and I came along to the VIP preview tasting meal this evening. We were each allowed unlimited green tea and miso soup, in addition to any four dishes from the menu. Only one of our ordered dishes could be hot but we were able to take anything from the conveyor belt.

Yo sushi is part of a national chain, but this particular location is really fantastic in that it offers a beautiful view onto Princes street gardens and Edinburgh castle. The seating, as in all Yo Sushi restaurants, is a little cramped and finding a place to put your bags/coats is kind of awkward. That said, this restaurant is more spacious than many other branches.

Despite being busy on opening night the staff were very professional and approachable. I ordered the tofu katsu curry, a dish I know from other yo sushi restaurants. I took the aubergine salad, the Kaiso salad and the strawberry cheesecake mochi from the conveyor belt. 

The refillable green tea and miso soup is a quite convenient idea. Had we not had so much too eat I would have surely refilled my miso soup several times. It took a while to receive my tofu katsu curry and it wasn't really up to the same standard as I have had it in other Yo Sushi locations. There was not enough sauce and one of the chefs happily added more for me when I requested it, but it was somehow more watery than it should have been. The panko breadcrumbs were faultless. Perhaps this dish could have done with less rice and more tofu? The aubergine dish was a highlight, the sweet miso sauce was delicious and the aubergine itself melt-in-the-mouth. The kaiso salad was less adventurous, an easy-to-assemble dish combining edamame beans, wakame seaweed, carrot and a sweet miso dressing. It was nonetheless very enjoyable. Another star of the meal, as I agreed with a friend who took the same, was the strawberry cheesecake. The texture and appearance was rather odd, but imagine sweet rice balls with a warm cheesecake filling... Okay, no description can give this pudding justice, just try it. Or maybe don't, at £4.30 the price tag is a little exaggerated. 

Overall my friends seemed happy with their choices. The pumpkin korroke (fried breadcrumb encrusted pumpkin) seemed a popular choice whilst the katsu dishes seem to need a little work.

I would definitely come back here to make use of the Blue Monday deal whilst gazing out at the castle.. Ruth up front is very sweet & nice & John is very helpful & nice.... all around amazing customer service & they did such an amazing job on my baby (my car) I would definitely recommend them to Family & Friends.. Only place I will go to for a full set. They always take their time and make sure you love them! They never lift or break and I work with my hands! 4/5 because it is the typical strip mall salon. But with great services!!. Salon Iaomo is a wonderful little salon in Applebee's/Mad Mex plaza in Greentree Rd. I have been going to SI for a few years now and I always leave satisfied. Although they offer many services, tanning, extensions, they even have a wig room, I go for the basics, cut and color. Brian is the best but all of the staff are friendly, helpful and knowledgable about their craft. From my experience, the pricing is about average for this type of salon. Color and cut will run you 90$. This price has also stayed the same for several years. No recent price increases. If you are looking for a great salon with expert staff, the latest gossip mags and a variety of services, I recommend Salon Iaomo.. It figures it would take me 7 yrs before I go to the empty strip mall down the steet, right before I move out of the neighborhood to try this place.  

IT'S GOOD.  Got a red pizza with sausage with a great fennel taste and mushrooms.  The crust... geez, it's good.  Definitely better than Rosati's and a few others in the area.... Don't miss this place if you LOVE a good cupcake.  Store is fun, the cupcakes are beautiful (& tasty). Some even have fairy dust on them so they twinkle & sparkle. Loved the orange & lemon.  Great flavor, perfect texture and good balance of frosting. Grab a cold milk or a cup of coffee & enjoy. And ... EAT MORE CUPCAKES!!!. One of the best Thai restaurants in Las Vegas and the US.... I have not encountered many Thai restaurants that are as good as this one... Really crummy area but the food is worth it..... Viva La Torta's!  You never knew you could find such yummy food in a strip mall!  We have done breakfast, lunch and dinner here and all of the above is great!  The price is fair and the food is fresh and hot.  The one thing keeping it from a 5-star is inconsistency.  I have ordered the same thing multiple times and although it is always great, it is also never the same.  Mostly it is cheese, sometimes it comes with and sometimes without.  I prefer to always have the cheese!. This place is amazing!!  I have broke my phone 3 times in the past few months and they handle it right away!!  Longest I ever waited was 30 mins!!  Thanks for taking care of your customers!!. I was remiss in not getting that one owner's name when we visited tonight, but he was delightful, and the chocolate was divine! I had two truffles and two ganaches and all were better than expected. The market's atmosphere was great. Highly recommend.. I'm new in-state, am straight Medicare for insurance (which usually means longer waits for Appts etc.)... That said, I was offered an appt the next week! I couldn't  make it, so they slotted me in for about 3 weeks out. We arranged for my old records to be sent by phone, before my appt, and to get labs done in advance. 
Everything worked like well-tuned clockwork, Dr. Dorvetti was extremely thorough, and I received my reminders by both email and a voicemail message... 
That's all I expected and more... I'll be making the drive from Surprise to Glendale, despite the first two reviewers comments... Still, I value their input and will update you after my next appt.... Went there a few weeks ago and what an improvement from what it was many months ago. Place looked clean, staff is super friendly. Most improvement was on food. We ordered Indian butter chicken, it had good and rich flavor. We also ordered a beef dish (can't remember the dish name). To my husband, it was a bit on the sweet side but I really like it.  Personal preference, I guess. I'd definitely come back and try more dishes.  Also their coffee is big thumb up!!. Myself and 10 other friends wanted to enjoy a Las Vegas show but weren't sure where to start.  Lu Ann at Showtime Marketing suggested Carrot Top and that show was amazing!  We wouldn't have had such a fun time without her great customer service. Thank you Luxor,  Showtime Marketing and Lu Ann for filling our weekend with great entertainment!. Came here with my sister and her boyfriend on Sunday, 8/3/14.

So, I've heard the garlic knots here are the best ever..... That they ARE!!!  Soft, Garlicy, and Buttery.

I ordered Penne w/Chicken in Vodka Sauce - LARGE PORTIONS!!!  

I also, ordered a 10" Spinach Pizza.  Crust is good.  Crispy & Thin.  I was a little disappointed that they didn't use fresh mushrooms and spinach.  One can tell if mushrooms are canned or spinach is coming out of a box.  It was tasty enough to eat though.  

My sister had the spaghetti in meat sauce - Large Portions again!  Very tasty - Sauce has a unique taste.  Not a bad thing - Just different.

I'll come again and try a different pizza, but will definitely be coming back for the KNOTS!. Thanks to Tom, I'm a Morehart customer for life!

After "winning" two free AC service visits from a *different* company, their tech recommended $700 in urgent repairs, threatening that my AC could shut down any second without the fixes. The whole thing felt sketchy to me (how did I even win this?!), so after getting a referral from a family member, I called Morehart. 

I first have to say .... TOM IS WONDERFUL! As I explained the situation over the phone, and read him the measurements provided by the other tech (only after I demanded that he give them to me), Tom advised that he was really doubtful the repairs were actually needed. I scheduled a service visit so he could come do a thorough check and confirm his suspicions.

Tom arrived promptly, and was extremely kind, courteous and conscientious. He explained everything thoroughly in ways I could understand, and without making me feel like a moron ((ahem-- last tech)). Not only did he confirm that the $700 in "urgent" repairs were NOT needed, but he found a smaller repair that was actually needed ... apparently the other company's tech was too busy inventing expensive, fake issues to catch any real problems.

In addition to this fix, our exterior AC unit is now quieter and fully cleaned, the loud rattle in the attic unit is now gone completely, and I have confidence there are no leaks in the attic ductwork. All for $500 less than the other schmucks.

Thank you Tom!. Chow King is a famous brand known through out a few cities in the rest of the United States. It rates up there in the "fast food" Filipino chains. This particular location seemed to be overwhelmed when I came in. The management seemed to be helping during the rush, which to me, is a good thing. It seemed to be a little chaotic behind the counter, but as the customer, I never felt any of that chaos, nor did it reflect on what I ordered. 

I love the chicken combinations as well as the siopaos(steamed buns with a choice of chicken or pork filling). Classic tastes with an affordable price. They even have frozen siopaos that are frozen!

Good eats for a good price.. At $5 a plate for a sizeable steak, two eggs, toast and house potatoes, you won't get a better deal in Vegas. Additionally, everything is cooked perfectly; the steak was deliciously grilled medium-rare, our over-easy eggs were super runny, the buttered sourdough toast was lightly crunchy, and they must sprinkle crack dust on their crunchy-golden outside and hot-and-fluffy inside house potatoes, because we could not stop eating them.  

I'm told this is THE place to go after a night of partying, but we grabbed a late dinner there sober and it was STILL delicious. And as further proof (not that you need it), the taxi drivers eat there, so you know it's legit.. We saw the sign to this place off the street and I was intrigued so we stopped by and ordered a chocolate chip bundt.  It was AWESOME!!  I always say that I can never make bundt cake as good as my Mom's even though we use the same recipe.  Don't tell my Mom this but their's is even better!  I guess capitalism trumps love.  =)  I gave it four stars b'c they only had a couple of varieties when we were there.  Also, I was expecting better service.  It wasn't bad but we told the lady it was our first time there and they didn't really say much to us.  Then again, I guess the title of the place says it all.. Great, fast, clean. Totally professional and nice. Gave me great upkeep advice. Will for sure be back!. Yes, I know it's only breakfast, but this place is amazing! Everything tastes super fresh and tasty! Expect to wait about 25-30 mins., but i promise you it is all worth it. Not to mention the staff is super attentive and nice. Am loving this place!. Have been here twice for a haircut and I'm thrilled to say I have found a great place and a great stylist, Lacey!   I am so happy that someone finally knows how to cut my hair. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed!. Loved this place , dinner was good :)  food is too much to eat though :)
I liked the ambience , it's cozy n bright :) I feel bad for eating after my gym though :(. One of my favorite spots for breakfast. The red velvet pancakes are AMAZING! They are so yummy, they come with a side of cream cheese syrup, which you don't really need to add, they are delicious with or without. The chocolate pancakes are delicious also, while they are served with a topping of whipped cream and bits of chocolate chips. I'd say the only thing I don't like about this restaurant is the size. It's a pretty popular spot, so if your hungry get there early because they fill up quickly and the wait can be anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour. When your starving and your seeing all the delicious plates being served steps from you, it can get frustrating!. We were sent to Genevieve by the concierge at the St. Sulplice Hotel, who told us it was his favorite chocolatier in Montreal. I couldn't agree more. Every bite is pure bliss. We also went to Suite 88, which is always nice, but Genevieve's chocolates really beat them hands down. The chocolates are pricey, unfortunately, so we didn't buy as many as we should have. Now... regrets... if only we had bought more.... Majestique is one of my favorite places to go for food and drinks! Great food, friendly service and fun cocktails - and that punch bowl! Try the punch bowl!! And order the gaspor pork and the fries - these two menu items are pure perfection. You might be questioning my credibility since I recommend the fries so highly - but trust me, these fries are a total game changer. They are sublime and absolutely perfect - I know it seems trivial, but try them. You won't be disappointed.. This place played the best music of all the clubs we went to that night. This was the second stop on the club crawl. The music was great, the crowd was super fantastic, ONE MAJOR PROBLEM, the security/bouncers they suck at life, they kept telling my party "move", "you can't stand here", "you can't stand there", "you're to close the the special little velvet rope." blah, blah, blah. Tell the security/bouncers CHILL OUT, life is to short. Overall, I would come back....maybe.. This show was simply spectacular! I don't want to give away too much but I will definitely tell you that you probably have never nor will ever see it the same as this! The effects are epic, the performers are extraordinary, and the stage and scenery is beautiful. Also, the re-arrangements of the props is masterfully planned out. 

It just seems like every body involved helps make the show possible! Aside from all the music and storyline [which is, of course, just like most of the other Phantoms] they definitely put more thought than usual into it. And to think they do this almost every night... man oh man I'm envious! 

Like I said earlier I don't want to give away any of the crazy cool stunts they entertain, I'm just gonna keep it short and simple: MUST WATCH IT IF YOU'RE IN TOWN!!!
Tickets are only $85 if you go to the nearest CVS or half price ticket seller [and there are many on The Strip] and that's for orchestra seating. But if you don't want the hassle of searching then going to the box office will suffice since ANY seat in the house is great, and I definitely admire that fact [makes me love the show all the better]. 

So enough of reading this relatively uninformative review, it's time you GO GO GO and see it for yourself !!!!!! :]. I love, love, love this salon!  The vibe and atmosphere were great!  Everyone was very friendly and I loved that it didn't look like every other salon and that the employees were all free to express their creativity.  

I saw Taylor for a Brazilian wax thanks to a Groupon deal I snagged a while ago.  She was freaking awesome!  She made me feel comfortable and held a good conversation the whole time she had her hands all up in my business.  The best part was that she did what only true waxing pros know to do.... when waxing the pubes there is one spot at the top of where the lips meet that has the coarsest hair and is the most painful to get waxed.  I've been to several waxers who do that spot in one hella painful yank... they literally tell me to brace myself and when to breathe because it's so bad.  Not Taylor, she broke up that area and included small sections of it into other yanks.  Trust me... it's a major benefit to your tender niblets.  While I can't say it isn't painful, it wasn't nearly  as bad as many waxers make it!

This is a small salon that doesn't appear to have a receptionist so if you are looking for a big fancy salon with snobby, pretentious girls greeting you, this is not it.  If you want a fun salon with people who obviously like what they do and where they work, this is it!  

I wonder if they need a pt receptionist?  I would love to work in a salon again and this place would be my top pick!  Haha.. We enjoyed our stay. It was a little hard to get to but that was a part of its charm, being in a quit residential neighborhood.  The breakfast was quite good as was the service. The space remind of an old school house with updated facilities. For example, there is a lift, but it is very small. The views outside some window are picturesque. 

Our bathroom had a large window that faced the residence acrosss the street. We pulled the shade but it's a little odd. The water temp was HOT in part because of radiator steam heating.  On rainy days,  it feels really nice. 

We enjoyed our stay. Not sure the people across the street enjoyed us much.. This place was amazing! Incredibly friendly and a very vast selection. Great prices! Definitely a great introduction to crepes for me and my daughter! I'll be back within a week I'm sure of it!. Been here numerous times over the years and it is consistently good. Nice selection to choose from, and always well presented. My lunch companion ordered the salmon which she said was delicious, and would still be talking about it into next week! I opted for the roasted beet salad with grilled chicken. I know....booorrring. But the greens were fresh, the chicken grilled to perfection, and best of all, the salad wasn't swimming in dressing.

We split a piece of the peach cobbler cheesecake. Our taste buds were absolutely jumping for joy. It was to die for!

Lots of locals frequent this place - and often. It's located in a strip mall in an area that is undergoing a revitalization. Don't let that stop you from trying this place. You won't be disappointed.. Um...YUM! Haven't had a gyro in years and I never remember them tasting sooo gooood! Cant wait to try other things on the menu.  I will be back!. After my trip from Paris, I was dying for some macarons. Of course, where in the heck could you get them in the middle of Arizona?! Did some googling and found Essence :) It is a small quaint restaurant and with limited opening hours. I decided to stop by for lunch and was very impressed. There were many vegetarian options, soups, salads, sandwiches, and their desserts are to die for. Of course, you can't compare a French macaron to an American one, but this one sure tops the list as yummy and flavorful. The filling is light and the outside doesn't crack easily. My favorite one is the pumpkin flavored one. 
I also had their mozarella grilled cheese sandwich and their berry iced tea.  Very tasty, light, and my whole meal (including dessert) was under $12.00, 

Needless to say, I love this place.. I can honestly say I have never had a bad experience at Trader Joe's! Always great customer service, love the vegan options, and I absolutely love that all Trader Joe's brands are GMO-free! Doesn't get better than that.. I love this chain so much but this location is lacking in service. Every time I go I feel like I am seriously inconveniencing the staff. A 5 star chain in my book but with a star knocked off because no one really feels like working here. Chips and queso or chips and guac (though the guac at chipotle is better) have to round out every meal (unless you're having nachos, in which case it might be chip overload!). They have a rewards program too that others have mentioned. If you've never had it, definitely try it out, but don't expect happy staff.. We ate at several restaurants in The Wynn and this was my favorite.  I made reservations the day before and had no problem getting the time I requested.  The day of the reservation I had to change the time, and again, no problem.  I was impressed by the decor when we walked in, it is like a little restaurant in Venice.  We were seated by the 'lake', the lighting was perfect, and the acoustics make for good conversation.  We ordered a bottle of French wine, a Gran Cru from Volnay.  The Sommelier came straight away with the bottle and appropriate glasses.  He was very knowledgable about the region, and also friendly without being too chatty.  We ordered a cheese and meat plate to compliment our delicious wine, which it did perfectly.  We only had appetizers as we were heading to a show and would be dining out later.  I regret that choice!  I wish we would have had our meal at The Cave!  The menu was full of good choices that I could pronounce and had some familiarity with.  I will definitely be back.. Good korean bakery! Tried their cake, was good.  And bought bunch of cake and bakery goods! Wish they have a store like this in mn.. Our whole family just loves this place! We love the owner, Ron, and we love his food! He sure knows how to cook some mean cuisine! The meat just melts in your mouth! There's nothing better than those Symphony Fries! Every time we have fries anywhere else, we now always wish we were eating Symphony Fries instead! Of course, our kids love the mac and cheese! The red velvet waffle was sinful. Just go try anything. I don't think you can go wrong!. Love this place!!! Just wish there would be a snack bar or something to eat while there. We jump for two hours and my kids are always hungry. Best jump place in vegas though! Way better than sky zone.. First of all, I love Britney and have loved her since ...Baby One More Time. I have seen her in concert before, and of course, really wanted to see her show. I went New Year's Eve. I loved it. It is true that Britney doesn't dance as much as she has before, but she did have a knee injury and 2 children. I also don't have a problem with her lip syncing because it is to be expected and I think her people even told PH when they signed her on to not expect her to sing live either the whole show, or maybe even at all. It is hard to dance and sing at the same time, so I don't care. I go to see the performance as a whole. While she did include "Perfume" and "Work Bxxch" I wish she would have also include "Tik Tik Boom." All in all, really loved the show and will probably go again. To people giving it bad reviews and saying the suspected that the show would not be very good or that she would lip sync and not dance much...why did you spend the money on the tickets and go???. Best steakhouse in Vegas I've ever eaten.  Excellent food and great service. Wouldn't expect less from a Tom Colicchio's restaurant.. Great pizza. I love plain cheese pizza their pizza is yummy. I can fold it in half and eat it! 

The inside of the restaurant is cozy and I always feel like I'm at home eating. Cute pictures on the walls. 

The staff is always friendly. They have good desserts perfect for take out.. Food and margaritas are really good. Food and drinks are pricey and the menu is limited. Overall, nice "once in a while" place to eat.. Happy hour 3-6pm Monday - Friday !

I ordered the Dynamite roll and it was delicious! I would ask for less topping (sauce and named veggies) because it did get a little messy/soggy. Other from that, thumbs up! I was also given complimentary edamame.. Yum!!!

Place was clean and not too noisy. Perfect spot for lunch after some shopping around Town Square :). Love this place!!! The food is great and the servers are awesome. :) The caesar salad is yummy.. This hotel is ok for what you pay. 
Not the best location but it's affordable and nice.. i can't believe it took me so long to review this hotel! i was here in august with fred g. and i LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it. 

staying here really makes you feel like your in NY. from the statue of liberty to the cobblestone streets of NY with hot dogs & pizza.. Great family owned Dim Sum restaurant in Summerlin that serves dim sum all day and SUPER fresh. Made to order! Love the congee with century egg, Shrimp in rice noodle, chicken bun because I don't eat pork and shrimp with eggplant or tofu. The prices are way better then some dim sum restaurants in Chinatown. Love how clean the place is too! Definitely adding to my faves!!!. This guy gave me a root canal.  I was so nervous, and he totally put me at ease.  Everything worked out fine, and a year later everything is still in place and working well.. Super cute little place selling lots of different loose specialty teas and a TON of spices. I was in specifically for the tea, so I didn't browse all the spices. They had 3 teas out for sample, and the lady working was very friendly, helping me find a tea I would enjoy. Prices are higher than the grocery store, but you have a much better selection. I'll definitely be back for tea and whenever I need some specialty spices.. Love the food... Service could be better, waited almost an hour for two cuts of cheese pizza, but it was great. Awesome! The food is amazing. I got the buffalo chicken dip and it was the highlight of my day! I also got a burger and it ranks up there with the best I've ever had. Add in a shake and you're golden. On top of all of that, the service and prices are great. I'd highly recommend this restaurant.. I can't believe I've never been to Ruby Nails being that it's so close to home. Came here because of the ratings on Yelp and I must say I left here completely satisfied. Better yet the service was fast and the people here are super friendly and great at what they do. My gel full set came out so nice and I couldn't be happier. I'll definitely come back here!. I am impressed by their good food and great service.  Waitresses are always friendly and attentive to our needs. The conveyor belt is  well replenished with fresh and delicious sushi. A great place to have a drink with friends. 
Very clean and reasonably priced. Highly recommended.. Bought a great pair of their 'eddie' ballet flats here on sale...deal. This store gives good...customer service that is. They noticed my sunglass case was a little too old and gave me a new one of theirs...lovely. I returned a few weeks later during their friends and family night and purchase a different color of the same shoe...perfect for traveling and the lovely shaded purples ones will be a great pop of color with my comfy and neutral travel clothes!

Hey if you see that girl walking by the Seine in Paris with the purple shoes...it's me!. Absolutely beautiful grounds. Golf course, restaurants, shops, botanical gardens, tennis courts...it's all beautiful. Definitely book a room here as opposed to the main section of the hotel - I'm not exactly sure what the difference is, but it IS a different (and smaller) building.

Our room itself was nice, but the view was what made it amazing. From the balcony, you can see the golf course, the mountain, desert views, cactus...everything. And the service was great.

The only complaint is that when I booked my stay, I was told that each guest would be assigned an "Ambassador" who would help ensure a great stay, or whatever. But throughout my weekend, this supposed Ambassador was never mentioned and didn't show up. Not a big deal, but if you're going to promise that service, then you better deliver.

Otherwise, great stay. I would highly recommend this hotel. Great for a relaxing weekend.. This is the best place we have had. The chicken is always tender and the beef has never had gristle like other Chinese restraints. The flavor is wonderful. We have been here 3 different times and ordered six different things and every time they have all been fabulous.. I always get in right away. My dogs smell great and look cute and happy after they are done. I brought them to a big box store one weekend for grooming, I will not make that mistake again. I can wait the weekend for Samy.. So as often as I go and as much as I enjoy this place I decided to update my review.  This is absolutely my favorite spot downtown for a sandwich.  Sure you can get Subway or Jimmy Johns for cheaper (not by much) but here you get QUALITY.  Their menu selections has something for just about anyone (they now started carrying gluten free bread) , sandwiches, soups, salads and pastries.  They also have a convenient online ordering system so you can place your order and pick up when you are ready.  

Their sandwiches are fresh made to order with exactly what you want.  Try one of their signature sandwiches, YUM! Or keep it simple...it's your choice. If you are not that hungry they offer a mini version of most sandwiches (using one slice of bread but super generous fillings)  I personally prefer to keep it simple, generally going for one of the following, ham sandwich on dark rye with everything, egg salad on dark rye (no cheese) with everything or peanut butter (house made) with honey on whole grain. 

They offer a variety of beverages including beer, wine and fresh brewed iced tea. You can feed your sweet tooth here with a variety of pastries or select candies they offer.  A happy hour is offered in the evenings, sometimes with live music.  

The service is quick , friendly and the ingredients fresh.  Crisp leaf lettuce and tomato on your sandwich are not treated as an afterthought here.  They take pride in their quality and presentation.  

Skip the big chains across the street and shop this local AZ business.. My BFF and I just found this place even though he has lived around the corner for 25 years.  Food was fabulous.  I had cheese burger and fries, he had a skillet breakfast with bisquits and gravy.  Waitress was a sweety, helpful and attentive.  Coffee wasn't the best tasting but was served generously.  Prices are great too!  Wish they had cocktails!. I was drug here kicking and screaming by my hair! 

Imagine you are out with your "friends" It's late OK very late or maybe early around 3am ish any way.. Your drunk and starving what do you do demand Waffle house or Jack in the Box! 

No such luck with this bunch, they pulled in to Village Inn. I am not a happy drunk at this point. I finally come to terms with the fact that our designated driver will not drive me elsewhere and begin to review the menu. 

I decide on a patty melt with onion rings. I am whining about my choice and just generally being a belligerent drunk wanting to boycott. Then the food came and quickly I might add. 

Holy rye bread drenched in butter and grilled to perfection. This was a damn good patty melt. I wanted to order another! I have been back 3 times since sober to get it and it is good. The onion rings I get with it are decent too. 

That is why they have a 5 star from me the deliciousness of that little patty melt they get 4 snaps in a circle!

Damn Patty is like a monkey on my back now, Just gotta get my fix!. Love this place !!!!!  Very homey feel to this restaurant !!!  RED VELVET PANCAKES w/ The Cream Cheese syrup !!!!!  YUMMO!!!!!. Anne W's review is spot-on.  This Starbucks location is always very welcoming both when I go inside and in the drive thru.  Very consistent and dependable when I am in need of a caffiene kick in the butt.. I would highly recommend this chiropractic practice to anyone. Michael Martin really listens to your areas of concerns and focuses on getting you in and getting you better, rather than making you come back again and again. You will never want to visit another chiropractor again after coming here.. The pizza is the biggest and best in town! The slices are ginormous and only 2.79 a slice! What a steal! Check it out!. Cloisters is easily one of my favourite locals, and with so many real ales on tap it is hardly surprising. The well priced ales change regularly so if you like to sample something new, then this is a great place to do it. The staff are friendly and enthusiastic about their beer, so if you're not sure what to try first, just ask! They'll happily pour you a sampler to help you decide.


 This bar is about more than just the real ale though, there is also a fine selection of whisky, they stock the fantastic Thistly Cross Cider, and though some regulars may gasp (it is a bar known for its beer after all), I've even enjoyed a few very good wines here: they have a great selection.


 I've only eaten here once, and to be honest they weren't the best nachos I've ever had... but that was a couple of years (and a kitchen and menu makeover) ago, so I'd happily eat here again.


 They have books on the mantlepiece and a selection of board games to play, this bar is very popular though, so you may be hard pressed to find an empty table to set your board up on.


 This is a great place to meet a few friends for some great beer, and some good chat, and just as great for a larger gathering.... I've been here for more than a few farewells!. It's hard to miss the Container Park when it's been headlining practically all the main Vegas magazines the past week. 

Yesterday, I finally got to taste the magic. Just like Disneyland, once you step inside, you are propelled into a completely different world - one that faces inward, shut away from the sketchy looking surroundings. Don't think Town Square. Don't start comparing. Just immerse yourself in what this place has to offer. It is what it is, a park, and people are expected to enjoy this place for its laid-back atmosphere, not exactly shop - although that is an option too!

The first thing you'll notice are the stacked shipping containers shelled with glass, revealing an artsy cluster of cafes, boutiques and galleries. Small local businesses line the first, second and third floors connected by stairs and continuous blocks of containers that would eventually lead you to a nice comfy sofa or table to sit on. Overlooking the balconies is the cute tree house which I was so tempted to go on and try the slides but I was too stoked with the galleries to even go for it. 

As you approach the back of the park, you will see a luscious green playground for kids to enjoy. With all the security they had there, I may trust the place enough to leave kids there (one day) while I go sit in one of the sofas by the cafe patio, overlooking them of course! Maybe. Still, I could not fully judge until I get to play in the playground myself! That's on my next to-do when I visit again soon. 

There's the industrial vibe it gives, urban mixed in with a Europhean flair of sophistication and great attention to detail.  That mantis up front immediately caught my eye because of its appearance at First Friday the two times I went. There's music as you walk and when the sun goes down, strings of lights leave a dreamy glow to the park. 

The Downtown project is reforming Vegas into a family-friendly cultural city, showing off its capacity to be more than a gambling hall. Win-win? I think so. Now we have our little piece of San Francisco. Environmentally friendly (separate waste disposals for different products), classy with emphasis on creating a vibe through art and music, hip people, unique concept. This place is my new heaven.. Today I had two very nice women come to clean. My house was in need of some deep cleaning. They worked hard the entire time they were here. We turned on music and I could hear them singing to their favorite songs. It was cheerful. It was a nice feeling to have my house getting a thorough scrubbing while I could focus on other things. I will use them again. I hope to request the two same ladies. I would recommend their services.. Wouldn't do my bike business anywhere else.. I have been on the hunt for the best Pho place since coming home from Vietnam and this is the best! 
The beef Pho is full of flavor and you have all the sauces you need to make it your own.  Spring rolls are fresh and delicious.  Fresh coconuts are a must!
Prices are also the best I have seen anywhere!. Fabulous ambiance- great food and great service.  My favorite place I have eaten at while visiting the Phoenix area.  I highly recommend!. I can now say that Chandler Dogs rocks just like its "mother" kennel, Gilbert Dogs. My Jack Russell Terrier has been going to Gilbert Dogs since late 2010. And he LOVES going! I just realized that Chandler Dogs is located just about 2 miles from my office, so I took Schooner there today to try it out. 

The most awesome part was hearing about how the Pack Leaders (aka employees) reconnected with Schooner. I guess Schooner was just beside himself with glee to see his old pals. 

Personally, I like the outdoor area at Chandler Dogs where the dogs can get out in the sun when it's not too hot. Gilbert Dogs does have an outdoor area, but it is a covered area surrounded by a block wall, so the dogs can't just lie in the sun and watch the world go by like they can at Chandler Dogs...not that a Jack Russell Terrier would lie around for long, but Schooner does enjoy his naps in the sun.

Thanks Chandler Dogs for the awesome place for Schooner to play while I work!. Went back again yesterday and had their mango limeade special - it was perfectly cold, tangy, and sweet on a hot summer day. It's easy to see why 24C is doing well. The people like working there and it shows in the atmosphere and quality of their food & drinks! Keep up the good work!. I have been here twice now as the places closer to mountains edge were not up to par.  

Both times I came, Chris did my gel manicure. Both times I have been super happy.  I have been able to wait four to five weeks between visits and nails still look great.  The nail shaping turned out great and I love the colors .

The staff is really friendly and professional. Everything is very clean. This will definitely be my go to place. Service here was amazing. Ask for Tammy!. Definitely  a small gem in Ballantyne .  ice cream ,belgian waffle coffee tea and more . Good to bring a friend  or kids . I feel like i am in Italy again ... Ummm. Stopped in for brunch to give food network some love and had a good meal. 3.6 stars

Food: 4, atmosphere: 3.5, service: 2.5
Cost to worth it rating:  3 (most brunch entrees around $16)
Return worthiness: maybe

Highlights: 
- Egg tostada: liked this a lot mainly because of the ancho chili sauce. It was smokey, dark, and sweet. Love that the eggs were just lightly scrambled and airy. Also enjoyed the crispy fried tortilla on the bottom and dug that the layer of white cheddar lined the tortilla instead of traditionally being draped on the top. Was a huge portion however. I feel like they used 8 eggs just for the one dish!

Midlights:
- Bread: just ok. I didn't think the corn muffin had much flavor. I liked blueberry coffee cake square the best 
- Pork sandwich: expected more bold flavors from the pork itself but the crispy panini bread was very good

Lowlights:
- Service: not very attentive--had to wait a while for our order to be taken 

Liked my brunch dish and would consider coming back.. Nicer than Outback-type restaurants, but not so expensive that it has to be saved for special occasions.  
We had the spinach and artichoke appetizer, and it was wonderful!  The dip is spicy, which makes it a lot better than other spinach dips I've had.
The steaks are very good, and worth the price.
I was very impressed that they brought around a dessert tray with all of their desserts - and I mean the real desserts, not just fakes.  
Well worth the money; great service!. Had a really good time here, music is good, crowd is nice and the ambiance is lovely!!!

bartenders are cute and helpful...decent crowd!

bathroom is hot have a drink while u wait to tinkle and have one when ur done. We have had previous experience with weekly pool service that seemed like a waste of money as they only seemed to come and skim the pool and change the chlorine.....all in 10 minutes.  When we started to have trouble with algae we hired Golden Bear.  Brian the owner does all the work and really cares about what he does.  He looked at all of our equipment to make sure it was running properly and found a leak.  He came by twice in one week to check the levels and scrub the pool.  All while keeping his prices down.  So glad I came to yelp to find this company....he deserves the business.. I love this place! I've been here multiple times before, but there was a big drought between the first couple of times I was here and the most recent times I did go there. This hits all my buttons- chic, urban decor, excellent, unique, seasonal food, friendly wait staff and reasonable prices. 

This place is known for their pizzas. They do a great thin crust, and have well mastered even the basics like margherita (absolutely delicious). They also have cooler, more uncommon options for those of y'all who are like me, and are addicted to the new and the different. I've had the Funghi (sucker for mushrooms and truffle oil), the Speck (ricotta, olive tapenade and speck) and the Yukon (potatoes! On a pizza! Too cool!), all of which are great. And this is across 3 or so years, since as mentioned I went there a few times a couple of years ago and then just recently twice in a short span of time. So they're very consistent in their quality as well. 

I've only just recently tried their pasta. And lamented why, oh why did I wait so long?! The one that truly wowed me was their seasonal item, the vegetable gnudi. It had soft, fluffy, quarter sized gnudi/gnocchi, swimming in this incredible sweet potato and squash broth, that had brussel sprouts and a couple of other vegetables that I can't remember. I wasn't entirely keen on getting it- after all, their version of the carbonara sounded so much more tempting! But I'm working on losing weight and so went for the healthier option. And O.M.G. It's sad they don't have this all year around, because both me and my husband were blown away. This was sweet and savory and silky and rich, and had just enough gnudi in there to really fill you up. No sharing this puppy, no sirree. (Well, maybe with the husband, but I love him and he's paying for my meal.) 

Their appetizers also are pretty great. I've had the Arancine, which are deep fried risotto balls. They're really awesome, crispy and rich all at the same time. And their roasted brussel sprouts were to die for. It had bacon and caramelized onions and I practically inhaled it all.

Cocktails are great too. I wish I could remember what I got, but I'm looking at the menu now and I'm positive it's not on there, so the cocktail menu is seasonal and does change, which is awesome. They're very unique combinations, and if you're stumped just ask the wait staff. They haven't steered me wrong yet. 

So yeah, the food is great. Couple of cons- Parking. It's iffy. I would say bring a bit of cash and be prepared to take advantage of the complimentary valet. It's better than attempting to find a spot, failing, and having to go back and try to navigate the Camelback Rd traffic. The place is also a bit hard to find. If you're coming from the west, always watch out for the Data Doctor's sign. Then get into the turn lane right away! It's riiiiight after that. They also don't take reservations. I've not had a huge issue, but for truly enormous groups it can be a bit of a pain. 

Fairly minor though, considering how great this place is. Definitely on the rotation of places I love to go to.. I booked this hotel online as a total rewards customer and got an awesome deal!  We checked in on a Sunday afternoon (line is always long) and was given a room in tower 5.  Hallways were rundown and dirty which made me nervous about what our room would look like.  To my surprise it wasn't that bad.  It wasn't till the next morning I realized that the bed was hard like a rock and the tub wouldn't drain.  On top of that, my husband ironed his shirt using the hotel iron and it ruined his nice shirt.  
We called the front desk and voiced our frustrations and was immediately moved to tower 1 in a Roman tub suite.  This room was newer and so much better.  Slept like a baby on the comfy bed and enjoyed the huge tub.  

I would recommend getting the suites at this hotel.  Rooms are better maintained and cleaner.  After making the switch in rooms my short vacation was that much better!!. Great Indian food! I had the Tikka Masala very spicy and it delivered (obviously it's a British dish).  The naan was good too. Hot and soft and the bottom was crispy.  The people working were very nice too.. Toque Montreal is ranked best restaurant in Canada. Second on the list is Hawksworth Restaurant at the Rosewood Hotel Georgia in Vancouver. Naturally we had to try this being in Montreal for the Food Bloggers of Canada Conference. Toque is located on 900 Place Jean-Paul-Riopelle; just around the corner from Le Westin Montreal. And it is easily accessible by the Metro. Get off at Station Square-Victoria. Toque's Executive Normand Laprise culinary philosophy is all about "une cuisine de produits". Using fresh ingredients to delivery flavorful dishes.

Toque reminds us a lot of Le Crocodile in Vancouver. It blends traditional French cooking with innovative sense of fun. The restaurant itself is modern and patrons primarily are business professionals. We recommend dressing for the occasion. Gentlemen, remember that sports coat. Oh, and no sneakers!

Toque Tasting Menu
TWO GLASSES OF CHAMPAGNE (2 OUNCES EACH) AND ONE OYSTER 30
MENU WITH OR WITHOUT FOIE GRAS (EACH PERSON) 122
WINE PAIRING : FIVE GLASSES 80
WINE PAIRING : SEVEN GLASSES 105
The tasting menus apply to the table as a whole.

Amuse Bouche: tuna apple confit with crispy bread. I love the bright apple that elevates the taste of tuna.

Blue Fin Tuna Tartare: When the ingredients are fresh, it just speaks for itself.

DUCK MAGRET AND HEART 50: This warm and earthy dish is filled with shiitake mushrooms, carrots, pear, Jerusalem artichoke, black garlic purée and Madeira sauce. The duck is rich and cooked perfectly.

SUCKLING PIG LOIN 50: oyster mushrooms, apple, celery, squash purée and poivrade sauce. In hind sight, we realized this dish resembled a lot of the duck magret and probably would have ordered the cod or the Agnolotii with duck confit and foie gras instead. Nonetheless, the pig loin was tender and quite delicious.

We didn't end up ordering desserts. We were so tired after a long flight that we didn't have much of an appetite. For desserts, I would have loved to try the blueberry mousse or the iced raspberry mousse with cocoa and almond dacquoise, Manjari chocolate ganache, and cocoa nib infusion. They all sounded fabulous.

Instead, we were presented with brown sugar fudge and white chai chocolates. The brown sugar fudge was amazingly define. It was sweet but not so sweet that makes you cringe. It melted in our mouths.

Toque restaurant is a great location for a special celebration and for those who want to experience traditional French fine dining. The prices are reasonably priced and the staff welcoming. Next time, I would want to try the tasting menu simply because we've done the a la carte style already.

I would recommend ordering a la carte and share the a few appetizers you have your heart set on. The menu can be quite decadent and rich. I hope you have a big stomach!. Very good smoked salmon wrap ! Always nice place me and my boyfriend can grab lunch !. Sandy is amazing.  She is only in on certain days, but feel so fortunate to find her.  She does an deep tissue massage better then most I have tried.. This is a great place to go to during the summer time. I love sitting out on the patio which has a pretty nice view of the riverfront. The fish and chips were delicious, the fries were sweetie potato and had this cinnamon sugar on them which was amazing! I only really go once a year since the price is a little high and I rarely go on the north side.. My little 5 going on 13 year old loves her classes with Rob!! Amazing team, people, coaches and atmosphere!! My kid is so happy at the end of the session (even though she is sore for the next 2 days and don't want to clean her room because she is sore) lol! Love them!! Cirque du Soleil performers practicing is also a plus!. First time here today ..saw this place on diner drive ins and dives ..it's a great find. The garlic naan was my fave we also tried the cheese naan it was ok. I had the mix grilled sizzler it was delicious. The chutney sauce was great! Definitely will be going back.. This is a salad bar to beat all salad bars! So many delicious options to pile onto your plate. I felt like such a pig with my mile high plate of veggie goodness. They also have a good selection of soups and breads and desserts. I was pretty full after my salad, so I didn't indulge into many of their other options. I did have a brownie, which wasn't anything to write home about. It was pretty dry. :( The area with the soup and breads didn't seem to have trays available, which was pretty inconvenient and was probably a contributing factor to me not eating more (maybe a good thing?) because I wasn't able to carry more back to my table.

We went here for lunch on a Friday. It was very busy, and we had to wait for a table to open up after we paid. Lots of families and kids.. My boyfriend and I kind of stumbled upon this restaurant through groupon and decided to come here. Our good friend is vegetarian, so we all decided to pick out a dish. We ordered the crispy eggplant that was recommended by many yelpers, the crispy veggie scallops, and the steamed ginger chicken with brown rice.

The crispy eggplant was really delicious. As stated by some yelpers, they are like french fries, but with a twist!! It was topped off with garlic, which I love!!! The steamed ginger chicken was to die for!!! It amazes me that its not chicken, but it tastes like chicken!!! It was mind boggling. hahaha. As for the crispy veggie scallops, it was good, but not great. I think it is because I am a huge scallop lover and I love the real thing. As for the price, they give you A LOT of food for what you pay for. =) Since I am a piggy, more the food... the more the merrier!! ::CHOMP CHOMP::

The staff was incredibly nice. At one point, the waitress introduced us to Chef Kenny. He was so nice and humble. Although we aren't vegetarian (except for my friend) we loved the food and definitely will be back.  I can't wait to try more things and maybe one day I will convert into becoming vegetarian!!. Love how everyone is so genuinely loving. Souls are saved and people reach out to you. The word is pure and I just love it!. Everything about this Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Aria is AWESOME!

I came in to look for macarons, and walked out with:

Raspberry Rose Macaron ($6.00) - a 2.5-3" diameter hot pink macaron with an ever so lightly rose cream and perfect fresh raspberries in the center.  A candied rose petal topped it.  This was like a Paulette rose macaron on its wedding day -AMAZING!!

Triple Chocolate ($6.50) - buttery and slightly salty toffee bottom crust, chocolate ganache, chocolate cream and vanilla cream layers, covered in a rich chocolate mousse, 1/2 enrobed with ganache, and topped with a ganache filled pistachio macaron.  With a roll of fudge on top, and a band of chocolate around it.  Omg, amazing!

Everything was mildly sweet, and the macarons were moist in the middle, with a perfect crust.

Each desert was packaged in its own mini cake box so perfectly - and service was gracious and fast.  My friend also got a scoop each of the pistachio and Oreo gelatos, and they were super yummy!

Jean Philippe, I think my good friend Paulette would eat you up.....I know I did!
 = P. This past June 2015 I ate at Lo-Lo's in Phoenix and their Scottsdale location.  I love their friend chicken wings.....Oh Boy!!  Can we say finger lickin' good.  
I had heard so much about this Southern food style restaurant from friends that I was so excited to finally check it out!  
The Phoenix location is very nice with great ambiance on a weird lifeless street.  The restaurant offers valet parking (at both locations) which I was surprised since its not in an upscale neighborhood The Scottsdale location is next to a hotel).  There's a separate attached space for happy hour and special occasions.  The restaurant clientele was a sprinkle of every race your could imagine.  They play the latest R&B and hip hop (kind of loud at the Scottsdale location) for your listening pleasure.
I was so excited to get inside and sit that I ordered a little of everything; chicken, buttered corn, potato salad, collard greens, cat fish and stupid fries (yes, that's the name - smothered yummy!).  We also tried to sweet Tea (not the Kool-Aid) served in a mason jars.  The food is good and reasonably priced.  Customer service was top notch and did I mention the Chicken....Finger lickin' good!!. I took my daughter here for lunch today and I really enjoyed it.  I had the chopped steak with a loaded baked potato and Caesar salad it was very good I was impressed.  But I guess it was a steak house so it should be good right?  I loved it so much this might be a weekly thing for me until I find something wrong knowing me. But it was really good, the bread was more than I expected not too many places have good bread but it was wonderful.  I got the chocolate stampede to go and I took a bite of it was I got home because I was stuffed at the restaurant. And it's also a wonderful thing, I can't wait to eat the rest of it. I guess I'm so impressed because I've never ate at long horn steakhouse. Not even when it was on abemarle rd, but I truly enjoyed my visit.  The staff was very nice.. I recently came here for the first time and loved it! The staff at the front were so kind and helpful. I only had to wait a few minutes and then I was taken back into the dental rooms. Everything was very modern and clean. I felt really comfortable here, and I really think it was because everyone seemed to like working there. My hygienist Brigitte was sweet and patient. She also gave me a good cleaning with the cavitron and regular instruments. Dr. Mayer was my dentist and he was nice and answered all of my questions thoroughly. I felt like he really listened to me and cares about my teeth. I will definitely stay with this dentist and am so happy I came here.. I had a leaky water heater and after turning away the contractor that the insurance provider sent out our way I found Liberty Plumbing and went with them based on their Yelp reviews. Boy I'm glad I did.  Friendly, professional, courteous, reliable and FAST! I called them at 11:30 and they were done, with new parts, by 3:00 SAME DAY. None of this 'wait 3 days while I order your part' crap.  These guys are awesome and honest.. This is one of the coolest shows I've ever seen. It was my first cirque show and I really enjoyed it. The performers are amazing. There is so much going on at all times during the show, you always have something to watch. The seats have speakers in the so it sounds like surround sound. I would definitely recommend this show, especially if you like any Beatles songs.. Just got breakfast here and it was really delicious! Ive always passed by this place and finally decided to stop by. I got the breakfast special, which is toast, 2 eggs, hash browns, and bacon for just over $4. Great deal, great food, and say service. I will be back for breakfast and to try their lunch items.. I love love LOVE this cafe 
It's at a lovely location near desert breeze park,  next to Koma Sushi. 

The interior/decor is is really unique and adorable. Great place to grab a refreshing drink and chat with friends. The peach tea is my favorite drink as of now til I try the other things on their menu and they have a broad selection!

Friendly staff and they also add a cute little toy to your order and the drinks are served in cute glasses~
And they have the cutest stamp cards to boot!. Good food! The place is ALWAYS busy. (Avoid on a Sunday if you can) Which is a good sign but, if they don't have their top notch server assigned to your table, get ready to need stuff and not have it.  Still, I would definately check this place out.  GREAT breakfast.  Country Fried Steak breakfast was wonderful.  Good crisp breading. Tender meat.  VERY tasty gravy.. Have always watched "Pawn Stars" on History Channel and finally get to check it out. First time queuing to get into a pawn shop, feels like I'm in a museum filled with displays of rifles, paintings, celebrity collectibles, antiques and etc, instead of a typical pawn shop~! They even have some cool merchandise to purchase and I got a tshirt for my dad. They have a huge car park just right outside the shop and shop is way smaller than I expected from the shows I watched. Overall, worth checking it out if you have not been here before.. We have been looking for a good pizza place near Nellis AFB with little success.  Then a friend (from NY) recommended this place.   It's a little hole in the wall.  Blink and you'll miss it.  It only has 4 tables.  The decor is a little grungy.  The service was excellent. You can watch them make the pizza.  We ordered rosemary garlic knots and a 14in with pepperoni, sausage, olives, mushrooms, green pepper, and garlic.  The garlic knots came first.  They were amazing!  A good start that had us excited to try the pizza.  We would not be disappointed.  The pizza was absolutely delicious.  The crust is soft and fluffy on top and crispy on bottom. The toppings were perfect.  It was one of the best pizzas we have ever tasted.  This will definitely be our go to place for pizza from now on.. If you would like a dining experience that will leave you absolutely floored, this is where you need to go. The management is friendly and the service is fantastic, the menu is rotating so everything is changing frequently. We got to Travelzoo and were incredibly impressed and even added on in an extra appetizer. 

This restaurant is family-owned and the owner was present and incredibly pleasant in making sure our experience was top notch. 

We had the cheese pastry as well as a lobster cake app, the wine was great and our waiter was patient and knowledgable. The lamb? What presentation!

The chef is visible in the kitchen is open and you can interact with him at the tapas bar. Come on in you will be disappointed.

I love this place so much I had to drop the review before getting dessert so I'm gonna go enjoy that now and you guys enjoy this when you come in! Nom.. One of my favorite places in Charlotte, Atherton Mill & Market is the perfect place to stop by on a Saturday morning or afternoon. It's lively and it's got that vibe that comes from people just hanging out and enjoying their weekend (it's a lot quieter on weekdays with less vendors, but just as nice). 

Start by having a healthy breakfast at Luna's Living Kitchen, then walk over to the market and take in the sights, tastes and smells. The aroma of top-notch coffee at Not Just Coffee, the fresh smells of produce that make me want to eat and cook at the same time, the cool little items being sold by local vendors...ahh, I get happy just thinking about it! 

Grab a coffee to sip and walk with, then walk over to the brand new Anthropologie to get your shopping fix. 

I love eating, shopping, coffee, and people watching, so I just love this place.. Okay, so I guess it's just the night crew or something, but I came on Sunday mid morning  for a quick meal and they were awesome! Much better than last time.. My FAVORITE store in Charlotte! I go there at least once a week for some item you just can't find anywhere else. But I love to buy gifts there, the selection of high end kitchen and entertaining wares is better than anywhere else in town. And, who doesn't love the classic Park Road Shopping Center?!. Way better then O Garden!! You have to try the cheesy ravioli, and the crispy spinach. The waiter told us that the crispy spinach melts in your mouth and it really did! The cheesy ravioli is like fancy mac and cheese, and really anything that is covered in a cheesy sauce is good! The service was phenomenal and will definitely go back again and again!!. The exterior of Parsons Family Restaurant has kept me at bay for years.  Recently though, I've noticed Glendale PD eating there and I think cops and firefighters are always aware of the best hole-in-the-wall restaurants in their hood.  So I decided to give it a try and I'm glad that I did.  Breakfast is my favorite meal and I usually cook it myself unless I'm running around.   Parsons offers no frills basic breakfast for reasonable prices.  The service is lightning fast.  Really low key, you can roll just of bed and come in here on a lazy Saturday.. We had family style- ordered 12 different entree for 7 people to try... Love the sea bass the most. Service was quick.. My favorite Chinese restaurant! Their food is ****ing awesome. I recommend their orange chicken! It's also a plus that they're super clean & the staff is incredibly friend! (:. Great BBQ dinners.  I have had the chicken and beef and both are excellent.  I especially like the "Thank Q" donut at the end of dinner.  Very unique touch that keeps me going back.. sushi burritos ... say whaaat ??? 

JABURRITOS hit the spot for me and the fiancé tonight.  Craved sushi but didn't want to go to a busy sushi restaurant.  I've seen places like this in Cali so I'm happy to see they've finally brought it to Vegas.   

All the guys working there are super friendly and they will help you out if you have any questions about the menu.   

The ordering is similar to chipotle/subway where they make it in front of you.  
The fish is fresh and they are generous with the condiments.  You can choose to customize it if you'd like or opt for a salad instead of a burrito.  If you want to "make it a combo" it includes a drink and you add a side salad, chips or, mochi.  The side salad was seaweed and I was craving cucumber salad, which they didn't have but the chef gave me some sauces to make it ... awesome ! 

This place isn't quite on my side of town, but I definitely would recommend others to come here to get your SUSHI BURRITO FIX !. Christine & Tracy from Aradia Fitness are the BEST! They came to our hotel room with a pole and OMG did we all have a blast! We learned some sexy moves and gained some self confidence in the process. If you are coming to Vegas with a group of women this is a MUST!. You forget that there is still this level of service and quality of food until you experience again.  Had dinner here tonite with family.  from beginning to end the service and the food was outstanding.  I had the chopped salad, salmon and the table shared asparagus, lobster and mash potatoes and mac and cheese.  Everything was outstanding--although we didn't, the salads are plenty enough to share.  my salmon was flavorful and cooked to perfection--the mash potatoes and lobster and mac and cheese however were sublime.  Our server was fabulous--timed everything perfectly.    From now on--I am going to remember how this level of service and quality of food makes for a great evening.. This is a must see!   I knew iit would be cool, but it was beyond neat.  Seeing the old signs and learning the history of them was well worth the $15.  You must make reservations, but it is well worth it.. Hardworking business owner with great results and pricing! Definitely beats competition I've used him a few times and with pet stains as an issue he really makes the carpets look brand new!. So, I am not into hookahs and we didn't even think about smoking.  That said, we were talked into trying King Ink at my friend's hen night (total fail) and needed to regroup and get back in a good place.  I had seen Rhumbar earlier in the day and it looked so pretty.  I led the gals here and we told the bartender that we were entrusting him to save our night.  No pressure!  He made us a round of delicious cocktails with muddled berries and we hit the patio.  Great DJ.  Fun folks.  Beautiful space.  Not cheeseball.  The bride-to-be was in the mood for something less fruity, so I went back to our new bartender friend and described some things she likes and let him do his thing.  He came up with the perfect cocktail for her.  I love bartenders like him!  My only complaint is that they closed so early.  We would have stayed here a lot longer, if we could have.  It was by far one of our favorite bar/lounges on the Strip.. They took me in on an emergency early on a Mon morning. They tried everything feasible to help my kitty, Missy. ..but sadly, we had to put her down. They are professionals, but kind, caring & compassionate. Your pets are in the best of hands here!. Oh My Gosh!  This place is amazing!  Super tasty and healthy too!  The sweet thai chili wrap is AMAZING but so is everything.  There's always a line but that's a good sign.  I wish I worked downtown so I could eat there every day!. First time ordering here, the man who answered the phone was very polite and efficient. Food is excellent! So far my favorite Thai place I've tried. I hope that they will continue to show me great service! I do not want to happen here what happened at Satay and Sakana! Hopefully they will show me that there are restaurants who still appreciate return and regular customers! So far we're off to a good start :). Between the SW at the Wynn and Botero at the Encore. I can't tell which one I like more. They are definitely both good. But I have to say I love the ambience at Botero more. It's just a bit more "fun" if that makes any sense. 

As for the food, their ribeye is to die for! 
I don't remember exactly what sides I had ordered to go with it(thanks to tequila shots) but I do remember they were all tasty. 

Definitely sit outside, and order the lime in the coconut as a cocktail. 

Cheers!. USUALLY, I would give it a 5, but my recent experience made them lose a star!! I LOVE ARCHI's!!! Everyone I know, knows that Archi's is my favorite restaurant of all time. Unfortunately, my friend, whom I took for the 1st time, found a hair in her Arnold Palmer drink. They quickly took it back and gave her a new one but didn't really take responsibility for it until my friend asked them to and they took it off her bill. Everything else was good, but I think that ruined it for her. Out of all my friends, she was the only one that probably wouldn't go back. I'm still a lover of Archi's. I usually go to the Flamingo location, but it was convenient for our group to meet there. 

Also, a few years back, they only had one location. Now, they have 3. THANK GOODNESS!!!. Nookie cookie is what I am calling this little expressed coffee shop inside the casino. 

I was waiting for our number to be called at Hash House a Go Go when I decided to pick up a cookie. 

The line moved quick and I quickly chose the peanut butter cookie but once I saw that it was two cookies for $4, I thought, "another cookie can't hurt nobody" so I chose the chocolate chip cookie as well. 

I should have waited until after breakfast....but we're in Vegas...who pays attention to proper eating habits?! So I ate the peanut butter cookie and OMG. This is the cookie that I've been wanting to bake at home but can't find that perfect recipe. It has a rich peanut butter taste without the flavor of butter or vanilla behind it. The outer edge was perfectly crunchy and the center was dead on moist....almost raw. It was perfect!! I wanted to hoard the entire cookie but played nice and shared it. I couldn't stop there. If the peanut butter cookie was that good...I couldn't imagine what the chocolate chip was going to be like. One bite into that cookie, I quickly realized that it was amazing. There were chocolate chips in every bite and just perfectly moist and soft in the center with a great crunch on the outer edge. Milk would have been the perfect friend with those cookies!! 

I will definitely return to Nook and will try their oatmeal cookie. Mom nom nom..... My husband and I have been coming here or ordering from here via delivery since 2008. It is the only place we order and get our thai food. I love the red curry and recently got hooked on the green one. The food and service has always been excellent.. Love this place and try to come whenever I am in town.  The service is excellent and very attentive.  Had the antipasto salad and it was delicious. It is big enough for 3 people.  Had the veal Marsala and the veal was cooked perfectly.  My son had the lasagna and it was good as well.  My husband had the veal chop Parmesan and he thought it was adequate.  Will continue to visit when in town. This is the good location. Awesome food. Friendly & warm atmosphere. They have a mariachi band!!! made me smile. :-):-):-). I had to come try this place. I've known Jo for over 10 years and always support him in all he does. The food was incredible. Anna was amazing as a server as well as all the staff there. Will definitely be coming back. The green tea white chocolate dessert was delicious!!!. I love Bubba Gump's! I'm originally from California so when I saw that they were opening a location here in Las Vegas, I was stoked. I finally visited over the weekend and my first visit to this location was great! At first we sat down at a table in the inside but we had been walking around prior to coming in so we felt too warm, we asked if we could be moved outside and without any hesitation, they said yes! The view is gorgeous from outside! All our food was delicious, I got Lt. Dan's Drunken Shrimp, it was seasoned just right! On the plus, I got a free Shaker with my drink purchase! I highly recommend them, our server was very attentive and everyone was friendly as well.. After walking by this beautiful little gem of a restaurant dozens of times without noticing it, we finally tried it out for dinner on a good friend's advice and had a nearly perfect experience.

The service is impeccable and the food is absolutely wonderful. Not only is it interesting and sophisticated, but it is beautifully presented and absolutely scrumptious. For appetizers, we tried a wonderful cold cucumber soup and a black cod piece served up in a volaille bouillon with salicorne de mer and wonderful little mushrooms. For mains, we had the arctic char with asparagus and a to-die-for primavera pasta with a lemony and cheesy sauce and roasted pecans (sounds boring but trust me it wasn't).

The wine list is extensive and features a lot of french wines. I tried a delicious and unique glass of Cotes du Forez recommended by our waitress and was not disappointed.

To add to the dining experience, the very Parisian style interior is beautiful and there is a lovely little terrace (patio) out front if you want to eat outside in the summer. And last bu not least, if you want to people watch, get ready to see fairly stylish groups of people over 50. it's a nice change from plaid shirts, tattoos and beards, right?. Drunk in public. Not one f^&* was given. Love the Bellagio. They have a cool chocolate fountain in their sweet shop which is to the right of the main entrance. I think it's in the Guiness book of records for some reason. Largest? Tallest? It's neat. They also have a seasonal exhibit that's free to walk through to the right of the main entrance. When I was there most recently, it was a fall scene. Water wheel, talking trees, Chihuly leaves. Neat!. Mmmm, Steerburger.

The Prime burger is a seriously good burger. For less than $5. The trio with fries and drink is like $8.50. Satisfies my craving for beef, bacon, and cheese, and doesn't come close to breaking the bank, so I'm a happy girl.

Get the trio, die happy and go to cholesterol heaven. Just ignore the dumpy ("classic") 1970s decor.. Excellent costume selection, including dance supplies, pro makeup, exotic wear, and traditional costumes. My only complaint is that I couldn't tell if there was a changing room, and I felt uncomfortable approaching the male staff I saw.. This casino is just beautiful...that is the best way to describe it! They had a really cool display with a huge bird house with cute little finches inside. Then all around it they had flower sculptures of birds and snails. Absolutely gorgeous!. Definitely a great team of people, they are always kind and friendly!. Words cannot BEGIN to describe what an amazing experience this was for my boyfriend and his dad. It must be EVERY man's dream come true...watching these two guys look like kids at Christmas as they get in the drivers seat and start to dig, knock over tires and play basketball. Thank you for this amazing opportunity to be a part of this special day for both of them...the over 200 pictures I took bring a smile to our faces every time we look at them! 

The entire team there was amazing...Dave, Amber and Ruben truly made this a once in a lifetime experience. 

THANK YOU!!!. Now, when you try try their noodles and broth, you won't mind waiting for a table. The first time I visited this place, I was aggravated by the wait and lack of tables, BUT after eating their miso with noodles, I understood why it was worth the wait. I have to stay away from that neighborhood because immediately I crave their noodles when I'm in the area. Addictive food, I must say!! Love i!!. Good eats and drinks after a full day of shopping! Waitress has a great sense of humor.. Good times. This place is great! I've been bringing Bruce (my French Bulldog) here on occasion ever since he turned 4 months. 

They know my dog by name. I always see that there is a person around in the dog play areas, cleaning and playing with the dogs. Also I  like how the dogs are separated by size. It can get pretty full but there is definitely enough space for them to run around or just lay down and lounge. 

The baths are great too and very inexpensive compared to other goomers.. That place was awesome. The band played a lot of 80's music. It was pretty cool. I loved that you could dance and not sweat to death. They actual had ac that worked. Great place to go for dancing and music. They had a band and smother room which had update music.. I absolutely love this place! The chicken and pine nut salad is fabulous, as well as the chicken pesto pizza, for my not-as-healthy days. Other pizzas are also good and the roast beef panini. The chocolate chip cookies are fabulous! 

The restaurant is very clean and the staff very friendly. I actually pick up food more than I dine in and I am always impressed with how they repeat your order back to you and show you everything before you leave with it so you know your order is correct. I'm here at least twice a month!. Love the flowers, love the fountain views, impeccable service especially from the maitre d' and cocktail staff. 

As for the cuisine... it's very good.  But not ethereal, nothing to distinguish this place from other top dining venues.  I had the tasting menu- loved the lobster salad and enjoyed the scallop especially the mashed potatoes it was placed on.  The fois gras was mediocre, and the lamb was pretty disappointing.  It wasn't bad just not better than at a mediocre place.  Also did not like the Mexican flavoring of the lamb such as the beans and peppers- tasted like a dish I would get from Fresh Direct in NYC.

The apples crepes were delicious and the chocolate fondant was good although no surprises- it's your typical molten chocolate- it's good, not inspiring.  The tiny petit fours after the meal were delicious.  The Pom Passion cocktail I had tasted like medicine. 

The service was wonderful except when the food came out the servers only described it with one word such as "lamb" and "fois gras"- you'd think a place like this would offer a bit more descriptive information on the cuisine... I had a nice dinner but not a particularly memorable one.. I love to swing through Pita Jungle whenever possible!

Every time I come, I cannot resist ordering something with pita and hummus, and it is always roaring good! The salads, smoothies, and pitas that I've shared are all delish.  Also, there are so many non-meat and non-gluten choices. The servers are hip without being pretentious, no snakes in the grass here. The decor is king!  Come on, what a cool giant mirror!

Just writing this review makes want to get lost in the jungle again!. I've been here for a drink or two plenty of times over the last 10 years, but until recently, I hadn't enjoyed a meal here. Over the last for weeks I've had a lunch and two breakfasts here. I have to say was very pleased with the quality of the food. The wait staff has been amazing with one exception.  Breakfast yesterday at the bar left a lot to be desired in the customer service department.  The service from the bartender was slow and she kept forgetting to bring things that I requested.  I gave the place 4 stars because that's the only time I've ever felt that the service was bad.  I just won't be eating breakfast at the bar on Saturdays anymore.  Kind of a shame since I'm opening a business right next door!!. Went to a realtor event the other night and they had this PINK truck serving sliders.  They were really good!  I recommend them and the curly fries were great too!!
We all lined up to get one and I think some of the guys went back for more. I was full with two sliders and fries.
Very friendly and fast service. This was the first time I heard and saw them but definitely can recommend what I had!. I love this place. It's perfect for date night or with a group of friends. Everything I've tried so far has been delicious and impeccably prepared. We had the fried oysters, bistro steak, and ramen tonight. It was all so good! I'm a steak snob and was completely impressed. Such a great alternative to an over priced steak house if you're in the mood for it but don't want to break the bank. The ramen was also killer, I highly recommend it. The service here is always top notch (except for the hostess who clearly didn't want to be there tonight, or is just too cool to smile). However, the bartender, Matt, was awesome and made our experience extra enjoyable.. I can not praise Pam enough, I think she is the best!  I came to see her because my nails were breaking and splitting because my previous salon used the same tool they use for "fake" nails on my natural nail and completely ruined them.  She was very friendly, polite and professional.  
Pam is now "My Nail Gail" and it is totally worth the trip from Goodyear to the Arrowhead mall.  Her pedicures are amazing.. Love the selection of sandwiches they offer at Laurel Market! I'm cutting down on my meat intake and it's a nice to see place that offers not one or two menu items that are veggie but more like over 15 different items--woo hoo. My only gripe is they close the deli a bit early and how I crave Chik Fil A every Sunday, I want Laurel Market around 6 or 7P knowing the deli closes at 3P. A bit pricier sandwiches but I'd rather see my money go towards a locally owned business than some chain place.. We have bought several big ticket items at Walker over the years.  In 2011 we spent $4K on a Tempurpedic mattress.  The salesperson was nice enough to "throw in" for free a mattress protector and 2 pillows.  The problem is that he didn't put them on the receipt as a "zero" charge so there is no record on paper.  And I NEED a paper trail for this because the very expensive (in my opinion) custom Tempurpedic mattress protector is falling apart.  It has a 10 year warranty and is only 4 years old.  BUT Tempurpedic warranty division will not let me return it to them for a new one without a receipt - they don't care if it was zero charge, as long as I have the proof of when I got it.  We called customer service at Walker and left a message last week, still no return call.  Then we called over to the store and got the actual salesperson who sold it to us on the phone.  Yes, I keep everything in files for everything we buy, even the cards from salespeople.  So the salesperson says he will call back in 20 minutes.  The next day he still hasn't called, so we call him again.  He assures us that he will amend the original receipt and email it to us within 5 minutes.  This was 2 days ago and still no email.  Meanwhile we had to go out and purchase another mattress protector.  I know that a basically $100 mattress protector may not sound like a big deal, but if this is any indication of how they handle customer service, I do not wish to support this company.  We are buying new furniture soon for our master bedroom, but I think we will avoid Walker Furniture.  I prefer companies that back up their products and keep their word.  --  **UPDATE 11/22/2015:  The manager resolved our issue, yesterday we went in and picked up the merchandise we got for our $100 credit.  Glad to know that this company does care about its customers.. Summary:
The price is right.
The men can dance.
They have legit accents.

The accents alone could melt your panties off. So I can tell you right now if you see this show you're screwed. Though not nearly as much as these guys will have you hoping.

The magical MC will charm your pants off, if you're wearing any. He did an excellent job of introducing the acts and the dancers, including an Aussie friend who isn't usually a part of the show but came to visit and joins in for the fun some nights. Side note- I'm absolutely sure this friend has the genetics of a Spartan warrior and Spanish bull because he's built like a brick. If I walked into his chest I'm pretty sure I'd break my face on it.

Anyways-  the show is SPECTACULAR! These men can MOVE! I saw The Chippendales and while they put on an amazing show there is absolutely no comparison when it comes to the dancing element- the Aussies totally dominate. The Chipps just weren't nearly as synchronized or sharp in their movements as the Aussies were. It was a very clear distinction, the biggest one really, between these 2 shows that I thought about once I got my tongue back in my mouth.

But dancing aside, what I'm sure a lot people are wondering about, is how good looking the Aussie hunks are and how well they thrust.

I will confirm they are good looking. If you like pale goths or small dudes (in either stature or dick size) you're going to have to use your imagination. A lot.

And these Aussie boys know how to thrust. And thrust. And thrust. Annnnnnd Thrust. By the end of the show I felt thoroughly thrusted with. I was quite happy.

I'd also like to mention that I had 2 men sitting in front of me who received the same amount of personal attention/straddling as any of the girls. These Aussies were just as friendly with the men in the room as the women which I thought was wonderful.

At the end of the show, if your legs have stopped shaking in excitement, you can walk up on stage and take a picture with the guys. And after that you can hang out at the Vue Bar with them, relax and have drinks. I got a chance to talk to them, their manager and publicist, and was able to ask all sorts of questions about the show and how it works and about the people themselves and their lives outside the show. The post show drinks are almost as good as the show itself. It's a great way to get to know the dancers as people, which I loved. It made me feel less perverted than I really am.

I've told my friends about this awesome show and we're already planning a trip for next summer. I can't wait to see these Aussies dance their pants off. Literally.. Great food and great service, parking is tight and come prepared to wait.. Pretty good hamburgers.  Fries are always freshly made and hot.  I do wish they weren't so tight with the fry sauce.   Ice cream is always delicious.   Yes, I would not hesitate to go back?. yummm fresh bagels and different cream cheeses. I liked honey almond yumm! I also liked their bagel sandwiches i got this fancy one with asparagus plus their coffee is unlimited refills and do it yourself. Only downfall it has limited hours :( free wifi!. I had new laminate floors installed today and could not have been more pleased with my decision to work with the folks at Empire.  From the sales person, Robbie to the installer Jim and Rob everything was absolutely wonderful.  The installation was amazing, from moving the furniture like it was their own to removing the old carpet and padding as well as all of the trash.  You would have never even known they were there.  They took great pride in their work and it showed.  I would highly recommend this team for any flooring needs that you might have.I had bids from several other companies and they price met the bid to get my business.  I am glad that I went with them as the result was awesome.  They know their business and it shows.  The Customer service person and the sales rep both stopped by the day of install and I even got a Customer Satisfaction call during the install in case I had any questions. Can't ask for more attention than that.   Love my floors--it is like I have a brand new house!!. I absolutely love this place! The staff is always friendly and the pizza is awesome. If you have never tried their pizza I recommend trying them out on a Tuesday when all large pizzas up to 5 toppings are only $10! It's a great deal.. I'm usually not a huge fan of froyo places because, for my money, I'd rather have ice cream than froyo. But one day I jonesing for something frozen and sweet, and my residual guilt from overindulging had me heading toward Tops 'N Bottoms.

The place is incredibly clean and bright with plenty of seating. There is a small selection of "bottoms" to put in your cup before you select your yogurt so that you're not stuck with a cup of plain yogurt after you eat all the good stuff. It's a nice idea, though I do wish there was some fruit at the bottoms station too.

The flavor selection is pretty decent, and you can ask for samples if you can't decide. The first time I went I got the cupcake and vanilla flavors. The vanilla was nothing special, but the cupcake...holy cow. I dream of the stuff. I crave it more than I crave Haagen Dasz coffee ice cream, and that is saying something. The cupcake is a red velvet flavor that is rich and delicious and perfect in every way.

I went back again when the desire for cupcake yogurt became too much, and this time I dragged the hubster along. I got the cupcake (of course) and California tart which was surprisingly good! I wasn't anticipating a "plain" flavor to be so delicious. It was perfect with the strawberries and blueberries I got from the "topping" bar. Good thing I brought the hubster - he got the white chocolate for me to try, and it was amazing. It will be perfect with the cupcake that I'll get the next time I go, because make no mistake - I will be back.. Street tacos were very tasty. Guacamole was very good as well. Would definitely recommend.. 4 years ago I had a HORRIBLE experience at Chapman - we were lied to, tricked, and screwed. Yesterday, after speaking with the NEW Sales Manager and Sales Associate, we were convinced to try again. WINNER!!! Tyson, Harvey and Ashley were WONDERFUL! They were honest with us every step of the way, worked hard to get us in and out quickly, gave me absolutely fair value on my trade in and an unbeatable deal on a new Santa Fe, and kept every single promise they made. I HIGHLY recommend them! It's a totally different place with people like these! AWESOME customer support and service! I'm thrilled with my experience, and my new vehicle!. D's has long been a stand-by for a good veggie hotdog and a nice beer selection for me. It has reasonable bar food and a reasonably priced wide selection of beer. My meat-eating friends seem to really like the wings and various meat hotdogs and burgers.

It is always very crowded during peak dinner times, even early in the week in my experience. Extpect a long wait on weekends for sure! 

D's is a comfortable place to go for me and attracts a young-ish crowd but not to young. The atmosphere is lively and casual.

Service can be slow but the servers are always friendly. Overall this is a good casual food place. The walk-in beer cooler and additional beer selection are a draw as well. 

They do have some vegetarian options as well, which I always appreciate.. this sushi place is one of hot new sushi restaurant in chinatown!!! if you're a sushi lover, you should try this place!!i'll promise you! you'll love this place!
never seen any other sushi place offers like this place!!
usually, lot of ayce sushi restaurants are like they give you so much of rice and thin sashimi so you can be full after couple of dishes but this place...i was really surprise!! i even said damn...look at this art!!lol seriously!! it's not about making people full fast..it's for the people who enjoys the food,environment and energy.
all the staff and sushimans are really friendly and kind..they don't care if you stay there longer and keep eating as long as you enjoy..they're really great!!!! they think about the customer first then their profit i guess lol
i love this place!. My husband had his prescription already so we went here for eyeglasses. The nicest lady named Ellie helped us find a great pair of glasses for him. It's the first time he has ever had to wear them and her help was extraordinary. I am going to bring my glasses in now for some new lenses. They had a pretty good selection and great prices. They took our Insurance VSP as well.

We picked up the glasses a couple of days letter and they were great. They look good on my husband and he is very happy with them.. Common Ground is everything a coop should be.  The people are great, there is a wonderful community of shoppers/owners, the selection is more than adaquate, and the atmosphere is just perfect.  There are lots of great classes to take advantage of, a nice selection of local produce (best in town next to the farmer's market), and the seasonal displays at the front are really nice.

I also love the fun events held there like the annual seed swap and the occasional music performance on the patio.  I highly recommend taking full advantage of this coop, it's much more than a grocery store.. Sitting inside the restaurant right now and I am so in awww of how come I have never thought of coming here before. I have passed by this place so many times but never thought of trying it out. What a mistake that was!!!! Braseiro has taken chicken to a whole new level. I had the quarter chicken leg, it was juicy, grilled on charcoal, it had that charcoali taste. It came with a side of fries and salad. The fries still had the skin on it, which made it even better. The food was fresh, the staff is very nice and friendly. Deserts are as good as the food itself. Coffee was excellent. The restaurant itself is small but cozy. Prices are very good, portions are reasonable.. First time eating here and it was delicious. The California "roll" is different but really tasty. And the street tacos? YUMMMMMMM. Kudos to Rosie our server, she was awesome.. Karsens is the perfect neighborhood place.  The veggie sandwich, veggie plater, veggie quesadilla, and grilled cheese (w/ tomato and green chili) are all really good and the fries are always hot and crispy.  Make sure ot introduce yourself to TR - he knows everyone in Scottsdale!. WoW!  Great Job!  They painted the exterior of our home and did a fantastic job.  They used Satin Dunn Edwards paint and Alex (Owner) was very knowledgeable about the fine details that needed to be done and then some.  The workers were prompt and kept busy.  They were very attentive and courteous if you pointed out a detail that needed attending to.  They only took three days to do our home and they were paid after completion.  I felt that Alex's price was very reasonable and that he seemed to be aware of these tough economic times that we are all facing at this time when he bided our house painting job.. There's no "deli turkey" here. Berthas roasts a turkey breast every day.
Fresh ingredients, fabulous sandwiches and salads...lunch perfection! Go early, or go late, because it's a busy place!. Tasty food and beverages, great service every time whether large group or table for 2.  High value.. Yesterday was my first time at this restaurant.  I had never had lo mein before ( I thought it was similar to chow mein) and I was unpleasantly surprised.  Not the restaurants fault- I just really didn't like it.  When the manager noticed that I was picking at my food, he asked me if everything was ok.  I told him that I didn't like the noodles so he offered to change it out for me.  All of the people who worked there were very friendly and pleasant, but the manager was really on top of it and I have to give him credit for being observant!!  I wouldn't have went up to complain because I ordered it.  But I wasn't going to eat it and I was kind of surprised at that kind of service! 
Way to go Pei Wei!!. Our group of seven women visited this past weekend as part of our annual high school reunion - it was a great experience. We all had services at the same time - we were mpressed that all of us completely enjoyed our services. Usually at a group spa event at other places, one person is disappointed in their services. We were all thrilled. Check in and check out was great - friendly staff. Clean environment. Fun gift shop. Decor could be updated - but services outweighed everything.. I purchased two Groupons.  One as a gift for a mani/pedi and the other for myself for a massage and a facial.  We called the Summerlin location and ended up frustrated because the person who answered the phone couldn't tell us what service had availability at what time.  We called again later and received the same answer,"not sure what time is available for a mani/pedi".
Seriously!
Ended up calling the Green Valley location.  Aaahhh much better.
We were able to get in on the same day for mani/pedi and a massage.  My massage was with Joseph.  Excellent, made me feel very comfortable, perfect pressure.  My friend also had a great experience with her nails and they looked great.
I ended up strolling into the hair shop and after viewing pictures I couldn't resist.  They had a special for 499. that included 18" hair, install, color cut and style.  I made my appointment with Debra.  She was awesome!  I had three colors going on at the same time and she was able to match my hair perfectly to my bought hair and keep some of my highlights.  I am very pleased and that is not easy to do!  Give Debra a try.....she will not dissapoint!  I have another appt. tomorrow for my facial.. Dined here the other day for lunch.  I did all you can eat which probably wasn't worth it as it was happy hour and everything is so cheap.  The atmosphere isn't great and the quality is just ok but the service and the price are great.. Best restaurant I have ever experienced. The most beautiful china and service is very professional. But the food is spectacular I have never experienced such delicious food it just melts in your mouth and right infront of you is the Bellagio fountains so it gives a great ambiance over all experience was excepcional. Definitely a place you have to go before you die.. A nice place to stay if you don't mind being pretty far from the Strip. The only reason that was annoying was because there was road work on Desert Inn Rd. which made getting to the Strip slow and difficult.

Room rates can be amazingly cheap if you go mid-week (Mon - Thur), but like everything else in Vegas, they shoot up on the weekend. But it doesn't feel cheap. The room I got was clean, adequately furnished and decorated. 

However, there are several lamps in the room but they are all rather dim. I had to turn on all of them. I also had an issue with getting hot water my first night ... I had to run the shower for at least 10 minutes before any hot water came out. Sound also comes through the bathroom vents rather loudly (it sounded like one guy above me was hacking up a lung when he coughed).

I liked that they had security manning the entrance to the guest room elevators during high-traffic hours. They came in handy at one point at 1:00am when a little girl got separated from her mother.

The casino itself is quite large. There's also a large kid's play area and a movie theater, and very ample parking (several very large parking lots on either side of the property plus a large parking garage). Lots of dining options inside the casino (buffet, Italian, Mexican, Chinese, and a couple of coffee shops including a Starbucks).. Usually I wait at least a few weeks before trying out a newly opened restaurant, but at the glowing recommendations of some food loving friends I decided to give this restaurant a try.  It did not disappoint.

To start off the decor was great, truly a transformation from the old digs.  It would feel right at place in a bigger city like Chicago or NYC.  Dark walls, a few large communal wood plank tables and vintage industrial lighting - chic without being over the top.

Ok, now to the important stuff. First off, boozy treats- only beer and wine here folks. They had a great selection of both at affordable price points. We ordered up a $33 bottle of Malbec that fit the bill. I saw a carafe of wine being served next to us but didn't see smaller carafe sized wine on the menu- I hope those become a permanent addition.

Here's a roundup on our food

1) Cheese plate served with dried/syrupy pears & cherries plus bread.  A selection of hooks aged cheddar,  fresh mozzarella, and muenster. 4/5

2) Charcuterie plate - This was my favorite of the bunch, served with lightly grilled bread and raw garlic, it consisted of chicken pate, blood and pork sausages that were simply delicious. 5/5

3) Fried squash blossoms with garlic aioli.  I like that they included some fried squash along with the blossoms, it gave a nice texture contrast but I felt the fry batter was much too heavy for the blossoms.  It was something akin to a cod batter used with fish fry, not delicate enough to enjoy the seasonal squash blossoms. The fresh aioli was good but needed a bit more salt. 3/5

4) Duck egg ravioli. a standout dish, this consisted of a large ravioli stuffed with a duck egg, pancetta, ricotta and topped with brown butter.  The browned butter was a little too generous making this dish greasy but still tasty.  Because it already has the runny egg yolk, the brown butter just seemed lost and competing for the fatty sauce space. Overall it was a unique dish and I'd happily order it again with hopes it wont be so greasy next time around. 4/5

5) Rhubarb strawberry pie. Served ala mode and was delicious end to the meal.  the fresh flavors of the seasonal fruit shined without being too sweet. The crust was great, delicate and tasted like something mom would serve up.  4/5

The service was warm and friendly, just what I have come to expect on Willy St.  However, the server gave no explanation on what the cheese or charcuterie plates consisted of and was a bit confused when we inquired.  Not a big deal as the place is new but at $16 and $13 a plate, with no menu detail, it should explained at the table so diners aren't left guessing what they are eating.  Overall a great addition to the Madison restaurant scene and I'm looking forward to many more visits.. I had the Veg pizza. Yum! The crust a bit meh but the toppings were delicious, fresh, and innovative. The service at the bar was impeccable. The atmosphere typical social club with a touch of hipster thrown in for good measure.

****What you really need to know is that Spirit the bar and Slice the pizza shop are separate entities. Spirit is cash only Slice is not.****

Enjoy!. Awesome place. Great food and great service. Atmosphere is easy going. Fast and friendly. The pizza and nods are delicious.. This was my first time here and I had a pretty good experience.  I met a friend for lunch because she said she loves the sandwiches here.  I haven't eaten a lot of bahn mi since moving to Vegas, and I really like them so I was excited to give this place a try.  Since I've been making pho at home for every meal I eat in, I wasn't about to order their pho.  THAT would just be pho-king extreme.

I ordered the spring rolls and #57, which I think was steamed pork and pate.  Can I just say, YUMMY IN MY TUMMY!!!  The spring rolls could've used a little more meat and shrimp, but it was still really good.  It wasn't dry and rubbery like some spring rolls tend to be when it's not fresh.  My sandwich was so delicious. The bread is impossibly crispy and soft at the same time, and the fillings were ample.  I loved the subtle sweetness in the mayo that they use here as well.  If I am craving bahn mi, I will definitely stop here. For a mere 3 bucks a pop, sign me up!

One negative is that the server never came back to refill my water even though it was sitting on the edge of the table empty for nearly the entire meal.  Just don't expect too much out of the service here, but again, 3 bucks a pop!. Popped in late on a Sunday night after 18 hours of traveling to Edinburgh.

Have to admire the fact that the bartender took such care to pour a pint of Guinness from the tap. I was mesmerized by the whole process.  Great selection of brews and scotch. 

The service was great. Nice people, tons of TVs to watch virtually any match you're trying to catch. Food was not as memorable as the pint of beer. But then again, I was new in town.  Cheers!. My friends and I were looking for brunch, and all the rest of the restaurants in the are were pretty crowded/had quite a long line. Stepped in here and were happily seated immediately. Loved our seats! We had an amazing view of the Bellagio Fountains from our window seats!

The food was good. My friends both had crepes that filled them up, and I got the scallops gratinees, a little but salty but the delicate scallops balanced it out well.

Very good, friendly service, too! Enjoyable brunch here.. I can't even begin to say enough good things about this place. After traveling from Texas to Phoenix, my friend and I were looking for some breakfast. This place popped up nearby on Yelp. We thought we would give it a try and I'm so glad we did. We walked in and were greeted by a very nice lady. This is clearly a favorite spot of the locals as many of them knew the names of everyone working there. The menu is painted on the wall and everything sounded delicious. We ended up getting the Huevos Rancheros with chorizo. It tasted great and was served with very hot and very, very fresh tortillas. Not only was this the best meal and service we've had all trip, it's the best I've had in a very long time.. As a vegetarian, I'm always on the look out for new delicious options. Also, as a huge fan of Mexican food, I've been dying for a California-style meal that didn't disappoint. 

As a result, El Burro is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh and the epic poems I would write in honor of their rice, bean, and cheese burrito would feature whole stanzas about how delicious their rice is or how the only thing that comes close to comparing is their nachos with soyrizo. It may end with a battle between the nachos and burritos where everyone wins and celebrates with delicious and fresh Mexican food.

Also, El Burro needs to deliver to the East End so I can eat it all of the time and attain my wish of always having easy access to delicious burritos.. I came here for Sunday Brunch after getting a 1/2 off deal on Creative Loafing. Service and food were impeccable. Our server was so friendly and funny! We chose to sit outside as the weather was so nice in the middle of March and really enjoyed ourselves.

Only pitfall was the manager - my voucher didn't have the dollar amount printed on it for some reason, so he tried to give me $15 off, instead of $30 which is what the voucher was for. We went back and forth about it, and he was not listening to me even though I had the email that stated it was a $30 value. I understood his side, but he really should of backed off and been more aware of the deals his restaurant is offering!  He finally took care of my entire bill, which was appreciated but he did say he was doing that because "we just weren't understanding each other". A little condescending if you ask me, but whatever. 

Brunch could have been ruined if it weren't for our server (Juan I think) who cracked jokes and jokingly offered to punch the manager for me, since he wasn't being nice to me at first. His attitude and helpfulness was very much appreciated and we left a nice tip on our $0 bill =) 

I will go back to Flying Biscuit, as the food is great but I probably won't visit this specific location again.. Demijohn is one of those shops that I have often walked past but never really gone in for a look. Probably one of the reasons is that it has usually been packed as it's quite a small little shop, full of liquid deliciousness.

Well today I finally made it in. I was looking for a gift for friends and thought I would find something interesting here. I certainly did! I wanted to get gin / vodka or something like that. The shop assistant recommended the Seville orange gin liqueur and gave me a little sample to try as well. I was sold - it was a lovely, crisp and citrusy flavor that would go nicely on its own or maybe with some tonic. I also sampled the gooseberry gin liqueur (very delicate taste) and the blackcurrant one.

On to the bottles. You have to pay for the bottle, so 250ml one was about £2.50 and gin liqueur added it came to £16.10. As it was a gift they offered to write a message on the bottle (haha), which I thought was a nice touch and something I hadn't even thought about. 

I'll be back! 

ps. thanks for Lindsay O. for initially giving me the inspiration for visiting this shop and giving me the salad dressing recipe I asked her about :). I love the Greenbush Bar! We were seated quickly and had fast and friendly service, even on a Friday night. The small Sicilian salad was enough for three of us. the meat lasagna special was delicious!. Nice sushi roll restaurant just near the library. Lunch discount offered for sushi rolls. Fish goes good usually but it might be bad depending on your luck. Congee tastes good but a little be pricey. I am always full after eating 2 sushi rolls.. This was really good! I have passed by here a 100 times and never been in. I was missing out! I love the cheesy decor that others have talked about in their reviews. I like it, gives it some charm and family feel for a chain. Almost feels like you are outdoors. 

Lets start with the Sangria. Mmmmm. That was some good stuff! The chips come out with three differnt salsa's. I loved 2 of the 3 and there was nothing wrong with the 3rd, just not my cup of tea. I had a shredded beef burrito smothered in cheese with guacamole. It was really good. Very flavorful and I would get it again in a second. The rice and beans were very good as well but next time I want to try the potatoes with chili. I had a bite of someone elses plate and they were fantastic, I was very jealous! 

Server was very friendly, fast, and kept our water filled and checked on us. Prices were reasonable and they have an email club that you get buy one get one free for your birthday. I will be back to try more menu items soon.. For my birthday, I wanted to go out for Thai so did a quick search of restaurants nearby and this place popped up on my phone.  After seeing the high ratings and reading some of the reviews, I was sold.  I trust Yelpers.

The restaurant is casual and relatively quiet so we could sit basically anywhere.  For starters, we ordered the Tom Khar soup and Vietnamese dumplings.  The soup was amazing with a perfect blend of coconut, lime, lemongrass, fresh ginger, and other magical ingredients.  I don't normally like soup, but this soup was addictive.  The dumplings were very good - I liked the fried garlic on top.  As we were eating, the owner/chef stopped by our table to see how the food, which was a kind gesture.

For dinner, we had the beef massaman curry and I had shrimp pad thai.  The pad thai came with a good amount of shrimp.  The noodles were more red in color than I have ever seen, but that didn't matter because it was unbelievably tasty.  The massaman curry had a nice blend or coconut, curry, and vegetables.  The beef was tender and flavorful from the sauce.

I really wanted dessert because the options were enticing, but I had other dessert plans.  The service was good and overall it was a great experience.  Can't wait to come back.. I stopped by here hoping they would have this super obscure hand quilting notion. Unfortunately they did not carry it, mostly machine quilting. Small shop with beautiful quilting fabrics and the staff was very friendly.. i have yet to order something that i have disliked. 
my favorite is the thai steak noodle salad- it's a must order. the only time i was disappointed was when i discovered their salsa was just Pace from a jar. 

AND the service is ALWAYS great. They stand behind the quality of their food and if it's below standard, they will take care of you! I always look forward to going to Houston's.. BEST HAPPY HOUR in the Valley no questions asked.  Their food is fresh and unique (buffalo chicken bites and fried pickles) and their drinks are tasty (hello white sangria) and reasonable.  Their brunch is delicious.  I see people give it mixed reviews, but I have no idea why.  All you can eat, made to order.  Their cheesecake is the best I've ever had.  The menu literally has something for everyone.  Their upstairs game room/ large group area is fun and very comfortable.  Our company had our Christmas party there and it was a huge success.  And last Thanksgiving we picked up a family meal from there and it was phenomenal.  And honestly not much more than I would of spent slaving away.   As for the staff.  I have been dozens of times and no matter where I sit (bar, main room or upstairs) they have always been attentive and personal.  And finally, the owner/manager Jeff gives you faith that there are still people that own businesses that take pride in what they do.. This rewards being a buy-local person: great owner, Sven, who orders things for less than the major chains (maybe used, but I like that!) and I don't pay franchise shipping costs, or the big membership fees.  Personable guy who is doing what we all want to reward.   Nice ambiance, just down from coffee, interesting browsing and earnest good will.  I will buy everything from here.. This past weekend, my son and I attended the "Prince Jonah Kuhio Ho'olaule's Pacific Island Festival." Boy did we have fun. We literally walked from one end of the festival to the other end. There was lots of different booths of food, shaved ice, beer, jewelry, clothing, accessories, and live entertainment. We got there around 430pm since we had lots of errands to run that day. Within the short time that we were there since it was open 9a to 6p, one day only, we can say that it was a blast. I bought for me a couple of Hibiscus Kukui Nut Hawaiian Leis, and a few hair picks. For Lil Man, I got him a Hawaiian necklace and shorts. The entertainment that we saw was on one of the festival was different bands playing, and near the entrance was Faith Thompson.. As for the food, they had all kinds, but the one both that we stopped at was the Samoan booth were I was very excited because I finally got some food that have always ate since I was little.. Palusami and rice. I was a little disappointed that they did not have taro and bananas, but the palusami and rice was good enough for me. As we walked around, we rang into other Samoans who were selling sushi rolls that were the size of my hand stretched out for $1 each.. I bought three, ate one and took the other two home. Here is one of the websites that you can go to in order to purchase precious gifts - www.hulumakana.com. Another company booth that we went to was for the Polynesian Creations. We are planning on going to the next one at the end of the month, which will be located at the Silverton Casino.. Salad was AMAZING! Halfbaked cookie and ice cream was to die for! Waiter was cute! 5 stars.. Great breakfast and great sandwiches. Family owned, and very well priced. I would recommend trying them out!. "OFO."  This establishment is fantastic for all eye-ware needs.  Not the "cookie-cutter," "run of the mill" items one might find at the chain or department store eye centers.  The owner and staff take good care to provide specialized service and are well trained to understand and meet the needs of their customers and fit them with flattering frames which are aesthetically pleasing and complimentary to the face.  High fashion and unique eye-ware, along with specialty need services make this a great place to shop.  Being treated as a welcomed part of an "extended family," while supporting small business in the local community and City of Pittsburgh, make "OFO" the place to support.   A variety of great shops and dining are within steps of "OFO," as well.

I have been having my eye-ware needs met  at "OFO" for many years and have relocated from one end of the United States to the other.  I continue to choose "OFO" and doubt I'll ever change my mind.  I always receive compliments on my glasses or questions about where they came from. It's nice to wear fashionable glasses that look great.  Also I find prices to be affordable but it is easy to carried away because of all the great selection.

I encourage anyone to stop in and look about the store.  It will be hard to leave without making a purchase.. This pizza is absolutely delicious. We are in town for a work/pleasure trip and  went based on other yelp recommendations and were not dissappointed. Their red pizza was a perfect blend of crust, sauce and cheeses. Very tasty. We also ordered a white pie with spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms ( I don't know that they were canned, but they seemed to be precooked) and sweet white onions.  The crust was smeared with a sort of garlic oil spread, then the toppings and finished with a blend of cheeses. It arrived perfectly cooked and piping hot from the oven.  There are a few booths in the back with a sort of help yourself drink set-up. The staff could not have been any friendlier. This will be our go to pizza place the next time we are in Pittsburgh!. I'm not going to turn down a donut if it looks somewhat fresh. But I must tell you, I am not a big fan of the dunkinkreme chains, and store bought doughnuts are just as disappointing. I was happy to stumble upon a local owned small business in Vantastic Donuts - they make doughnuts fresh, the way I remember them from when I was a kid. Getting doughnuts was such a treat, and the local Marie's Donuts in North Highlands, CA (google yelp them!) can not be beat.  But Vantastic is reminiscent. At 8 AM on a Sunday morning they had a wide spread of fresh fried delicacies, including a chocolate cream filled which was my personal favorite. The old fashioned doughnuts were fluffy and iced just right. This is my new doughnut shop, and by the modest crowd in the dining room, I'd venture to say it's been a local favorite for decades.. Guaranteed Pest Control is the reason that I sleep at night.  I had a scorpion issue and it was a Sunday night.  I called Trey in a panic and he was there to help me.  Since then with regular visits I have not seen another scorpion.  Trey is a family man who takes great care of his customers.  Thank you Trey and Guaranteed Pest Control, YOU ROCK!!!!!. Misty and co. are still kicking my butt! I love the new Barre classes and Misty's constant evolution as an instructor. I visit often from the west coast, and notice that she is always on the cutting edge of the practice, incorporating new "toys", techniques, and tricks to ensure that every class is working the whole body.

The new Shadyside studio is awesome, with tons of brand new equipment and a huge, bright studio space! This is still the best Pilates studio anywhere--including California. Sorry Ellie Herman.. This park offers everything for any age / kid to adult. From live music, to train rides, carousel rides, icecream, family picnics and much more. We love every visit here and the kids never want to leave!. I just went here the other day with my groupon in hand for a massage. The owner came out and shook my hand after entering into a pleasant and cozy waiting area in which artwork for sale could be found on the walls while you wait. The staff there immediately greeted my partner and I--they were super friendly and helpful. The address and place can be a little easy to miss but I actually overheard the owner telling someone they are acquiring a large sign for out front. I didn't feel this area was run down at all, it's the Coronado high school area and, being an Arcadia area native, I was quite familiar with the location. I'd totally go back.. Came here on a Saturday night and the band was really good! I wish I found out the name of the band because the lead singer had a really great voice! 
My husband and I came here with 4 other friends whom we've known since college and were trying to catch up on each other's lives over a few beers and food. Maybe it wasn't the brightest idea to choose some place with a live band and drunk people to catch up, since it was hard to hear each other talk, but oh well, we had a great time anyway. 
I suggest getting the short rib flat bread. It really made an impression on us, so we would definitely order it again. I think we also ordered the bacon onion jalepeno, which was pretty good. I ate the corned beef and cabbage for my entree, which I cannot make an impartial judgement about, simply because I love corned beef and cabbage and I loved it here. Our waiter was super friendly and had so much to talk about to, so he was very entertaining. 
I ordered Guinness with my meal, so unfortunately I didn't try some of the other beers. That will be my goal the next time we go back, because I guarantee that we will be back there, hopefully for happy hour next time!. Price is normal for all you can eat.. Staff is very nice ... Baked muscles are amazing .. They have amazing flavored Sake!! Defiantly worth checking out.. This is the best coffee house in AZ; they have the best red velvet cupcakes.. I am again amazed at how awesome this place is. A busy Friday night and the hostess gals are cool, calm and collected. I sit outside in the freezing (you know, 50 degrees!) weather for my table, under a nice warmer and they bring me a DRINK! Cool beans!

I am such a weird eater, and make that disclaimer to all our wait staff. So the polenta appetizer and a side of beets for dinner doesn't even make her bat an eye. And both are fantastic. The beets come with pears, romano cheese shavings and pistachios. (There were some greens on top, but I dispensed with them---way too healthy!) The polenta is cooked, sliced into sticks, fried and covered in parmesan (do you feel the "cheese" theme?). The grapefruit ginger wine cooler recommended by one of the wait staff was a great compliment to my selections.

Hubby had the "Big Star" pizza, a manly and meaty pizza, which he completely devoured. He had a nice small pitcher of beer that fit the bill.

We were too stuffed to even think about dessert, but we'll be back (maybe tomorrow?) to hit that part of the menu. 

As stated in countless other reviews, ambiance is great, menu swell and I have to say, after the week I had dealing with snarly vendors, what a nice change of pace in the service department!

Love Churn, Love Windsor and now I officially (YELP) Love Federal Pizza!. My husband and I made a quick stop here while we were walking through Caesar's, and I'm glad we did.  We were immediately taken care of by Ramon - super cool.  I ordered the pub spots.  The spots were tiny but were definitely packing flavor.  We can't wait to return to try something else!. For more than a year I've gone to this lab at least monthly and sometimes more often for blood draws and routine testing. At first I would try to "psych out" a time when I figured few others would also be there - I was almost never right. But, without fail, behind the reception desk sat Ruta Tanai, patience personified. I've never seen her upset, never heard her lose her temper (as many who are waiting do), never found her to be anything but helpful,  professional and pleasant. 

Going to the lab, for whatever reason, is not something most people look forward to but if Ruta Tanai is the one who will take your information and orders and insurance card/s, then things just got a lot better! Thanks Ruta!!. Yelpers you were right again!  Had the combination dinner of mongolian beef, fried rice, spring roll & wontons.  Everything was delicious and although the fried rice was meatless it was flavorful--some of the best fried rice I've had in the valley.  Hubby had the egg drop soup which I thought was absolutely delicious but he thought it was a little salty (but what does he know?!) .  He did like the flavor, but you know, always a complaint.  He had the orange chicken with brown rice which he liked especially because the crust was not heavy and they spiced it up the way he likes it.  Prices are very reasonable.  Service was attentive since it was a rainy day and we were the only ones there.  Their delivery business seemed brisk (although not to my area.)   I'll have to drive there to pick up my orders but I tell you, it will be very much worth it.  I definitely will be back.  
Thanks to Yelpers who give credit where credit is due.. I set an appointment for myself and a few other family members to get pedicures and manicures done in preparation for my sister's wedding. The girls were very helpful in helping us pick out colors and designs for our feet and hands. The foot massage was nice and they are very happy and pleasant to talk to. 

We are all very happy with the experience and will definitely return!. Have been coming here with friends for several years!  DELICIOUS and ridiculously affordable sandwich lunch specials around five bucks.  I always get the falafel sandwich and they let me substitute the tahini for tzatziki, my absolute favorite.  Mango smoothies are delicious and huge for the price.  Fries are thick-cut and yummy.  Lentil soup is also a great choice when you need something to warm your stomach up. 

Great atmosphere, clean place, convenient location on Baseline, and friendly service!  Come here, you won't be dissapointed!!. At least 250$ a night and they nickel and dime you and a coke is 3$ at the 15$ black jack tables. Not very impressed. Although, some of the staff is nice. Located in a great place.. This is the only place I go to buy cigarettes anymore. The drive-thru is great and they have even super-rare brands, all for cheaper than most of the cheapest cigs you can buy at a gas station or elsewhere. I smoke Capri 120 menthols, and i get them there for $6.75- a brand i haven't been able to find for under $8 anywhere else. Great value, as tax-free reservation cigs normally are, and the service is never unpleasant, usually pretty friendly. I'd probably go broke if it weren't for On Auk Mor!. Such a comfortable setting and amazing bartenders/ bar backs. Thank you for a great experience and attentiveness.. Expensive but I LOVE it!

Look, I am a Marriott rewards member, and while the rooms are expensive they are really nice, the 17th floor was awesome (by the way it goes from 12 to 14....like 14 isn't really 13 at that point). The breakfast had fresh fruit, and not the cheap melon stuff, the actual strawberry, raspberry and pineapple. I am a loyal rewards member and have yet to stay in a bad hotel!. Chris was SUPER nice and funny!!! 
He was quick and actually talked to me, I'll be back just because of him. 
You only get 4 stars because I was super annoyed I couldn't tip him with my card! 
Take care of your employees by letting us tip via card,,,. On a random Tuesday night while here with a friend, I observed the most beautiful men coming and going from this place!  That alone was enough to make me want to stay awhile, but this is actually a very cool little place!  Modern aesthetic, friendly Staff, and great food, but I have to say that I am especially excited by the JUICE!  This is now the third JUICE place in Old Town, and I am ECSTATIC!  FINALLY!  The only thing more exciting to me is that they use recycled materials, and sell soda/water that benefits others when purchased.  I LOVE a company that cares about its footprint and the welfare of its people!  This is fast becoming my favorite little spot!. Bosa has become my new guilty pleasure. I have to make it stop before someone hast to crane me out of my apartment.

The glazed buttermilk donuts are easily my favorite. They look like tiny loaves of bread. They're really dense, and sweet on the outside, with a more tame, cakelike interior. Yummy.

And, c'mon, 24 hour drive though? That's dangerous. You can also get a bag of day old donuts inside for some insanely discounted price. I have yet to try this for fear that I will eat all of the donuts in one sitting.

The employees at this place are always friendly too. On more than one occasion, we will find that they have given us a free donut or two. Yummy!. My friends and I split up looking for a snack. I found lobster me in the mall. It's a cute little shop that does lobster rolls, lobster fish and chips and varietys of other lobster things. I chose the lobster fish and chips with Cajun fries that comes with a complimentary coleslaw. YUMMY IN MY TUMMY. My friends were eating their chilli dogs and watching  me with envy. I devoured my meal. The lobster was tender not overcooked, the fries lightly seasoned to perfection and the coleslaw was sweet and cream just the way I liked it. My only complaint if the portion size was small. I know lobster is expensive but they could give your more fries and more slaw bump it up from 13 to 15. I was still a bit hungry afterwards. I regret not trying their lobster rolls they have hot and cold ones. They look like the real deal and Ronnie told me it's a full lobster in every roll.. Food is great.  They were out of what I wanted to order but it was still delicious.  Definitely give it a try!. Today was my first day dropping my daughter off at kidz kidz kidz and I have to say I'm so impressed with how much these children are learning! I hung out in the classroom for a little bit before I left and watched the kids go over the days of the week which almost all of them knew, how to count to 20 in English and Spanish and also their letter of the week which was K and I couldn't believe these kids knew as much as they do! I'm so excited for my daughter to grow and learn in this environment! 

And just to top everything off kidz kidz kidz is very clean and organized and all of the staff are extremely professional and friendly! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone with kids (:. This was a great place. They had took us right away. They were nice and friend and the place was clean. My nail lady, Kim did a great job! Very detailed .. The best of the best! XS is by far, the best club I have ever been to. My group got passes and strolled into XS around 10ish. When I first walked in, I couldn't believe how ginormous and gorgeous the whole set up was. The dance floor, lighting, wall decor, pool, casino rotunda....it was simply breath taking. The music was good--but I didn't see any DJ booths to make requests. The people were friendly. Nobody super aggressive. There was the perfect amount of energy flowing with the drinks/music/dancing. I loved every minute of it! 

Also, there was never a long line for the restrooms. And it never got stuffy/humid while dancing. ANDD there were pretty go go dancers. ANDDDDD there were elevated dance poles between the bottle service tables so girls can showoff their pole dancing skills. You'd be surprised at what you'd see up there. If you go clubbing in Vegas, you better make sure XS is at the top of your list.. One of the best service I got at a breakfast place! People are super friendly. 

I wanted to come here for a couple of things. One, is the cinnamon bun and two, is for their biscuits and gravy. 

Cinnamon bun came out first and it was nice and fresh from the oven. It was cover in sugary glaze sauce. YUM. I was only able to eat two or three bites and couldn't eat any more. It was way too sweet but good. 

Next, I ordered the biscuits and gravy with a side of hash browns. The biscuits was delicious. It was warm and toasty and the gravy wasn't too bad either. The biscuits are cooked in house and you can taste the different from the store brought ones. The hash browns are the best here. Nice and crispy in every bite. Love it. 

It was a little bit off the strip but I would come back again. However, you must come early this place gets pack real fast.. Let me first start off by saying the food is out of this world! We normally come for happy hour and chow down but decided to come to a late dinner tonight. Obviously the prices are much higher on the regular menu but it's still worth it. The New England Clam chowder is one of the best in town, close to California quality but not quite. They have an amazing BBQ Crawfish Spinach Dip that I've never seen anywhere else and crave it often. 
The only issue I had tonight was the fact that our server charged us a sharing charge but didn't inform us that there would be one. Also, our appetizer and dinner came out all at the same time and our server's comment was, "the kitchen must be fast tonight!" Well, obviously! That's the reason for the 4 stars, otherwise it would be perfect! We will continue to come here but will most likely stick to happy hour.. We have used Sir Carpets for several years & have always been happy with the customer service, price & of course outstanding job they do on our carpets.. My company came into town for an industry event. We came here after a long day to unwind over amazing sushi. For the price, it's a great value especially in quality. I definitely would recommend this spot. It's a bit of a drive since it's off strip, but I'm telling you....it's worth it! Candice (our server) was super patient and informative in what dishes to get! I can't leave out the hostess either. Even tho members of my group were grumpy and impatient in getting seated...she was always smiling and reassured us. The service alone is 5 stars!!. I really enjoyed this small coffee shop.  The espresso had a nice smooth flavor.  The space is very cool, and the environment is very laid back.  I went on open mic night.  Had a lot of fun.. I am no expert, so i needed help deciding since there is a whole binder of teas. It was a very relaxing, and calm atmosphere. The only negative I'd say is that they use bells to call over the hosts, which I find degrading to them. I feel like I am calling a dog. It may be just me, but I feel like I am putting someone down. Anyways, its great, and would visit again!. I've been pleased all 3 times going to urban mutts! They know my babies name.. He leaves there feeling like a total Romeo ... Very clean , prices are actually a lil cheaper then most.... Love Jamba Juice! Fresh made smoothies and delicious hot oatmeal. If you see a menu item that sounds pretty good don't be afraid to ask for a tweak. The workers are always accommodating with changing recipes to suit your tastes.. Ok...so I know I have said this before, but this is legit.  

These are the best tacos in the valley...perhaps anywhere! It wouldn't have even happened had Fajardo's Cafe been open! We had driven out to Glendale and it was closed, so I jumped on Yelp and this place came up!  

It's a very small place and if I hadn't read Floyd C's review, I probably wouldn't have found it! (Thanks, Floyd!!!)  It is on the north east corner of 59th Ave and Camelback.  However, it is facing 59th avenue...yeah.  we drove around a few times...then read the review! Oh....gotta love random adventures leading to a diamond in the rough!

You go up to the counter, order...and they hand you a little plate to fill with all of the fixings they have at the salsa bar...which to be honest...they're all AMAZING!!!!  Plus, they have cucumbers, lettuce, onion/cilantro mix, carrots and limes! LIMES!! Remember...I have a lime fetish.  

***the ONLY complaint I have...and it is not even that big of a deal and I won't be taking any stars away is that they don't have cilantro alone...I hate raw onions. Like to the point of having a close to "ick" reaction! *** Anywhoooo...

I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and a lengua taco with a side of beans.

The lengua (tongue...yes tongue) is absolutely flavorful and SOOOOOOOOO tender!  The carne asada is probably the most flavorful I have ever had here in the valley!  The beans are amazing and super yummy...it seems to me that they have chorizo and cheese in them.  

The service is quick and not so personable, but not rude at all! They are busy and are pretty much just making sure to get everyone their orders!  We will be back! Every Tuesday! ;-)

Wanna know how much we enjoyed our meal?  We each ordered a carne asada burrito to go...for lunch tomorrow!  We never do that!  

So who is up for Taco Wednesday? Thursday? Any day that ends in "Y"??. Wonderful staff and great food. Love the specials. The salsa and chips are great. I had tacos for my meal and I will say they are the best I have had in along time. I tried some of my husbands burrito (steak) and it was very good. The spice was just right. I would recommend you stop by and try it out. We will return.. My husband took our Jeep in to be repaired. There was a problem with a belt. They gave my husband a ride to work and called him several hours later. He picked up the Jeep and it running great. We will definately be back.. Had a BLT from here today and hubby had the grilled cheese with three cheeses, both were good but the pesto they included for us to try was exceptional! Loved it with both sammiches  next time want to try the cheddar potato soup.. This is a place that has decent quality food. It's in a very small blink and you'll miss it place and has it own set of regulars that come. it's very small and quiet inside and there's almost no one at the counter until they hear someone come in. We come here every now and then. I love their egg rolls. I'd recommend their lunch specials. They are listed on the window and you get rice with your order as well as an eggroll in a medium size container for less than $5. Only until 3:30 PM each day. I love getting the beef and broccoli lunch special. It's much cheaper then getting the beef and broccoli  with rice later for around $8 with no egg roll :( Haha. This place is unreal!  I had lunch there yesterday- on the recommendation of these reviews.  It was better than I'd hoped, all of the food on the buffet was fresh, hot and tasty.  Service was very good as well- we'll definitely be back again, and again.... Absolutely love my new cut! Fair warning it will take a long time because they are students but I've never had someone pay so much attention to detail on my hair before. It was totally worth it!! I took 5 inches off and was very impressed with Rihanna!! LOVE LOVE LOVE. GORGEOUS, fair prices, incredible views, extremely well decorated.

Top shelf liquors, great wine list, incredibly laid back, New York like vibe.

This place would get my highest recommendation for a date with a girl you want to bring for drinks; it can be super romantic at night. After, just go to MOzen for dinner, just down the elevator.

There's no doubt this place is going to be packed through and through once city center officially opens all its doors. Useful tip: there is a dress code, so you must show up with nice shoes, collared shirt. Don't forget!. Delightful. All the classics of Asian baked goods. We had a range of goodies: topping the list were the scallion bun, the ham, cheese and onion bun, and the thick cut perfectly square bread loaf. Which were all excellent. The egg custard was good, not great. Looking forward to an even larger selection of options as they grow.. I saw Nathan for my first appointment. I recently moved from Illinois and was very nervous trusting my hair to someone new. He did an amazing job with my highlights and cut. 

I will def be coming back. I trust him with, little to no guidance on what I'm looking for, that it will look great.. The Veggie wrap was Delish. This is an awesome place. I can't really add anything to what the other reviewers have said except maybe I would like to curl up here for a few hours with a great book. If you have to eat good food and drink good coffee why not donate to charity at the same time? I love eating and shopping for a cause.. This is a review of the afternoon tea service. We couldn't be more pleased. It was a relaxing, albeit pricey, afternoon break! They give diners the option of standard tea service for $30 per person, or for $38, they add either a glass of champagne or a green tea martini. I had the martini and it was smooth. The tea service itself was top notch - our server was attentive and friendly without being intrusive. The scones were still warm out of the oven, so no complaints there! Everything - the sandwiches, desserts, etc. were delicious.. Dinner in a treehouse! 

It was my first time visiting Mastro's located in the shops at Crystals.  This beautiful and elegant dining can be seen while walking through.  The 'treehouse' as they call it sits directly in the center so it's very hard to miss.  The wooden structure will catch your eye in a heartbeat.  

We made reservations for our group and were seated early.  I would like to give a tremendous thank you to Paul our waiter.  I don't think I've ever been so entertained while receiving the best service anyone could ask for.  He went above and beyond to make our evening memorable. 

The table is brought a bread basket which has 3 options. I will say their pretzel bread called my name.  I asked for more in which Paul graciously brought an entire basket of just those.  Fantastic! 

I started with the wedge salad.  Perfect and delicious.  The crumbled bacon had a great flavor combined with the creamy blue cheese.  For my entree I chose the Chilean Sea Bass accompanied by creamed spinach, Gorgonzola mac and cheese and Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi.  Of course all of the sides are huge and were shared between all of our group.  The sea bass was so light, fresh and baked perfectly.  The gnocchi was a disappointment.  I don't think there were any crab pieces in this. But the other two sides definitely made up for it.  They were so creamy.  Anything with Gorgonzola will make me happy. Simply delicious!

If the appetizer, bread basket or main meal didn't fill you up, they have a great dessert list.  On top of that list is their signature butter cake.  It's topped with vanilla bean ice cream with strawberry drizzled around the cake.  It's calorie free and fat free... In my dreams! It's moist and delectable.  After the huge meal, I would suggest splitting this huge cake.  

Mastro's delivered an impeccable meal with first class service.  It was surely a memorable evening!. LOVE, LUST... whatevs 

the 1/2 190 octane 1/2 Cat 5 hurricane w/ an extra shot tube is the bomb. com ;)


cant wait to try the Peachtree Bellini next time. EVERYONE AT SALON D'SHAYN IS SO HELPFUL AND FRIENDLY!  D'Lisa is amazing for waxing and running the salon and Jude is a rock star with hair.  I am a redhead (formerly natural, now not so much) and she has been able to duplicate my childhood haircolor EXACTLY!  I will never go to anyone else but Jude!  I hate salons that feel like cattle calls - too busy and unpersonal. One of the reasons I love this salon so much is that it feels like I am at a close girlfriend's house - comfortable, relaxing and easy.  I can even work on my computer while I wait for my hair to process.  They aim to please!. Came here for brunch. Great ambiance and rustic design. Got the deviled eggs, fried chicken n watermelon n waffles, and mac and cheese. The fried chicken was really good but the deviled eggs and mac and cheese were just ok. Also, got the watermelon sling which was good and strong. Service was also really good. Would definitely come back for the fried chicken.. My FAVORITE buffet in Vegas! 

The variety is not as big as other buffets, but the quality of the food makes up for it! For the food you get, the price is great! Prime rib, crab legs, risotto, lamb, asian food, pizza, cheese & crackers, chocolate covered strawberries, macarons, gelato, shrimp and grits, etc etc etc. Everything is on point!

I love and hate the concept of portioning out the food in little dishes. Yes it's cute, but sometimes I don't want to try that much and I feel bad for wasting the food :(. Loved doing this!!!! Fremont Street isn't the best area but this was one of the best things I did in Vegas. My friends and I did it at night. We had to wait 45 mins for our turn, so while we waited we went sightseeing and got some drinks. Once 45 mins hit we went upstairs, put on our gear, and went down the zipline. It's really quick, but man its so much fun!!. Girls one thing: TIE UP YOUR HAIR!!! My hair was in my face almost the whole time, but its great and this is a good start for someone who has never ziplined before, not too high and you get to see the bright lights of Fremont. Definitely do this at night.. Literally the best experience. 
Customer service is a 15 out of 10. 
Food was great. And they were able to give my group so much information and cater to our bodybuilding needs. 
The best. 
Hands down.. What a wonderful surprise to find Chef Michael DeMaria had opened another restaurant. Formerly, we were fans of Michael's at the Citadel.  The innovative concept for this restaurant is outstanding. It combines the ever changing freshest of ingredients with the most wonderful inspired recipes to offer just he perfect menu selections for those  for want a light meal or a heartier one. The menu outlines the chef fresh ingredient in the dish with its other components in a list from lighter to more complex. Everything from the first visual impression, the excellent knowledgeable wait staff, the delicious bread sticks and the wonderful menu is done with integrity and good taste.  We will definitely return on our next visit to Scottsdale.  We only wish we could visit more often as the menu change every month. Congratulations on a very novel restaurant innovation.. This is the best nail spa in town. I have been going there for 10 years and they consistently do a great job! No chipping in between pedi's, great foot massages and nail care. And they always check when I'm  paying to see if I was satisfied with my nail service. Desert Nail Spa is the best!!. Desserts are amazing here! I've tried the one that had gummy bears and a Hawaiian ice cream sundae. Both were delicious. I've tried there food I just didn't like the string fries.. I see lots of bad reviews on this location and now I wonder when I'll have a bad experience there. I usually dine here once a week for a late lunch for happy hour after I wake up starving from working the night shift and before my pedicure excursion. Prompt greeting is not their priority and some of the server girls can be a bit dizzy. What that means is that sometimes you have to ask for things to be brought to you. They are friendly though and stop by the table frequently to see if you need something and I have no problem telling them what and if I do. It's a casual environment, I just woke up, I'm in my sweats and don't need 5 Star treatment or food yet, you get my drift... Mozarella sticks; very good! Boneless wings with Daytona Beach sauce; very good! Onion rings; very good!  Their iced teas; not so good, I wanna bet they're made from a powder, not freshly brewed. House margarita; awful! Weak and watered down. Just stick with local draft beer, soda and basic wings. Nice outdoor patio area with water misters where I can smoke, I'm happy! Sure beats a drive thru!!!. This is probably the cleanest goodwill ever. Good location and the store is always organized. Prices are good and the staff are friendly.  Even when the store is crowded and the line is long, the employees are fast to run up at the front cash registers and help out . they also always have some kind of a discount thing going on to help you save more money. They even sell new items at a reasonable  price. So- The prices are great, the deals are good. The employees are friendly. The store is in a nice location and its always organized. And that's why I give this place a 5 star and I would recommend this store to everyone I know.. Love this place! If you are in Vegas, please stay here! Its beau tiful! When you walk in they have art and flowers every where! We had the bella suit 2 beds and it had a living room area! The bathroom is beautiful and very spacious! Rooms are cool and you can also control the temp! Room service is amazing, when you call on the phone, they address you by last name! Room service is right on it! Its like they are up in 5-8 minutes max! The bellman are very nice so make sure to have extra dollars to tip! Expect nothin but the best when you come here! Lines may be long to check in. So pick a fligt time where is not right at 3! Also we had a car service pick us up from the airport! The hotel can arrange this! Its better than the shuttles! Pay the extra to drive up in style! Plus the driver will take you around vegas if you have some free time before checking in!. Am I at Bucca di Bepo? Seriously, that's what I questioned during our meal here. In traditional Italian American fashion, the portions are ginormous. And by ginormous I mean a whole family of four could eat off these portions. This doesn't even include the salad you get with your meal. 

I wish I knew that before we ordered the fried zucchini. It's okay though. I've never had such lightly battered, yet crisp fried zuc in my life. They were thinly sliced pieces of deliciousness. You can still easily split the pile of zuc they give you between four people. 

For an entrée I was craving eggplant parm. What I got was two massively cut pieces of what looked like lasagna. I believe the make up was as follows: eggplant, cheese, eggplant, cheese and more cheese. Whatever, it was really tasty. Throw in a decent sauce and perfectly cooked ziti noodles, and I'm sold.

Family style rules here, and that's okay with me, and my need for leftovers.. This store is exceptionally clean, very organized, and has plenty of friendly staff to assist you while shopping.   The only problem I see is that they need "MORE SPACE" 
The proceeds from the store go back into the community and that's awesome-Good Behind Bars, thank you for all that you do!!!!. Very pleased! I've been hopping denist offices since we moved from Mesa to Chandler and have had the WORST luck. Until I got a flyer in the mail for Fountains. $25 for new patient cleaning and exam, I thought I'd give it a shot since my family was due for cleanings.

I schedule cleanings for my 2 kids. We arrived at the appt and we were warmly welcomed right away. Some quick paperwork to fill out (bonus: they also have the new patient paperwork online so you can fill it out at your convenience) and then the hygenist Nicole came and took us back. She was really sweet and great with the kids.

Then Dr. Ramsey examined them. My daughter had a strange looking tooth on her x ray and he really took the time to explain to me exactly what it was and what my options were. 

I really like this office because I feel that I was treated as if I had been going there for years and that they genuinely care about your health. Dentists are a dime a dozen, especially in the east valley. So it's nice when a practice doesn't look at you solely like you have dollar signs on your forehead. That was nice. (How sad that I'm actually so amazed at being treated like a human being at a dental practice!). 

Furthermore, they have a very good in house dental plan for those who don't have dental insurance. There is an enrollment fee and then you get your cleanings for $25 and 30% off other procedures. 

I think I've finally found a practice I will stick with!. I love this place!!! Hate waiting in line for a movie hate having to look for a good seat because they are always taken... But this place.. I love how it os just s few seats so you don't have to worry about other being too loud or having to worry about where to sit. Just buy your tickets online and you get to pick where you sit and the best part bout it is that they are reserved! I love going to the 21 and over, their seats are so comfy and so huge you can literally lay on the couch! It's like being at home and having s waiter! YES!!!. Yum! 
This place has an amazing menu!!!!
So many great choices it was difficult to decide.  

I'm not going to lie...it was a little difficult to find too.  It is in the middle of a couple office buildings. Not very good signage either. 


Anyway...looking at the menu, I just struggled with making my choice. 
Luckily one of the guys at my table decided to split some things with me, so we could taste more. 

We started with the 3 choice meat and cheese tray. It was wonderful.  We chose the wild boat salami, prosciutto, and a truffle pecorino cheese. They tray had dried fruit, two sauces and came with fresh toasted bread. I really enjoyed this.  

Then we got the lamb ragu and a Caesars Salad.  Both were very good. Check out the pics I took!

Definitely want to come back here and try a few more things on the menu...just wish it wasn't so far out of the way!!!!!. Pork chop plate: YUM! Comes with a mound of rice with some sort of sauce on top, a hard boiled egg, and tasty pickled cabbage and carrots. $8 cheapest thing we ordered and best thing we had

Taiwanese chunk chicken: gingery, star anise-y, Chinese 5-spice-ish. Not spicy at all. Decent. Comes out sizzling. Not worth $13 IMO.

Mapo Bean Curd: this is my usual pick for Chinese/Taiwanese restos. Huge portion but meh. This is usually spicy! Why y'all holdin out on spice??? Cost $10 I think.

The last page of the menu has a list of personal dishes and are super cheap for the amount of food you get.

FAST and friendly service. Tiny restaurant, hard to find parking.. I love Irish bars except on St. Patty's Day. This one is pretty good. They have comfy, leather bar stools and the bartenders wear cute skinny green ties. They have great happy hour specials both on food and drink. We had a couple beers, a couple house wines and a shot plus 3 apps for $25. Try the fried potato pancake on a bed of baked beans topped with an over easy egg. Strange but tasty (and 50% off at HH). If you like garlic, the mussels and huge grilled shrimp are also good and also half off during HH. It gets crowded especially on the patio so not the easiest place to step out for a smoke...but  few people smoke anymore so you probably won't care.. A bar with SHUFFLEBOARD, friendly staff, SHUFFLEBOARD, and creative takes on typical bar food? I'm in trouble, since I live only a few blocks away. And love SHUFFLEBOARD!

Came here briefly last night for a UYE but couldn't stick around. Staff was super friendly, from the servers to the owner, who went out of his way to make us feel welcome, ask for feedback, and allow us to sample menu items.

Highlight of the menu is the jalapeno fries: tempura-fried jalapeno strips with a tabasco-spiked ranch dressing. The light batter mellows out the spice of the peppers, and has a similar effect when used on the fried pickles.

Really came for the burgers, which are stuffed and topped with additional cheeses, jalapenos, and bacon, in a few different varieties. Unfortunately, I found that the burgers didn't quite live up to my expectations: thy were a bit too overloaded and difficult to eat, buns fell apart, and the plethora of gourmet toppings/stuffings PLUS the traditional burger veggies was just too much. 
As for the burgers themselves, the Jalapeno Popper one outranked the Big Mess burger for our group, but we were in agreement that the patties were overcooked.
Partially accepting some blame myself, as our burgers were taken to-go, and the steam trapped in the box likely contributed to the buns falling apart. 
Good flavors and good value for price though: $11/each.

Will come back for appetizers and SHUFFLEBOARD (anyone want to try to beat me?), and likely to watch a few games. Good selection of beers on tap as well.. Decided to go to Dakota for dinner on a Friday night. We sat in a both and were promptly greeted. I ordered a specialty drink Peachberry Fizz and my boyfreind ordered a vodka tonic and my girlfriend just had an ice tea. I really enjoyed my cocktail as it was not to sweet. We then decided on dinner. I ordered a burger with fries. The burger was great! Cooked perfectly. The fries were good but not my favorite. They were fresh hand cut fries (think In and Out) and to me they cool down way too quickly. The seasoning was good but the herbs were a little to heavy. Still very tasty though. My boyfriend had the Crispy Chicken Sandwich and side salad and he really enjoyed it. My girlfriend had the Asian Chicken Salad and loved it! The portions were perfect for everything. I cannot wait to come back and try other items.. Oh man. The momma pizza is so delicious. The sauce is tangy. This is a great place to go for a large family gathering. They don't mind if you have a lot of kids around. We go to Imaginon or Levine Museum of New South after it a lot (pizza and museums/libraries? That is awesomeness). The parking is also easy.

Now, I did give it 5 stars because I don't see a reason not to. This isn't the BEST pizza in Charlotte though. To be totally honest, I don't know what the best pizza in Charlotte is.. I really enjoyed working with Living Energy. Their professionalism and attention to detail during my event was beyond amazing! 

The team at Living Energy worked seamlessly together to make sure our event was awesome! I would highly recommend this team for any event. A huge thank you for a job well done!. Andrea is awesome!  Very professional and fast.  Will definitely be going back to her.. Went to Defalco's for lunch recently and was instantly consumed by the smell of fresh bread, garlic and sauces. Like walking into an Italian Grandmother's kitchen. Intoxicating. 

The deli case stocked full of salami, pastrami and every other -ami you can imagine! There were olives, cheeses and already prepared dishes that you can eat there or take home. I ordered the cheese lasagna. You pay for it, take a number and wait. While waiting, let your eyes and senses shop the grocery area with all sorts of imported pastas, sauces  and other products. 

You can't be in a rush with this place. About 10-12 minutes later, voila! My lasagna arrived to the table with a warm, crusty side of garlic bread. So damn good! I simply cannot wait to stop in again. 

Bon Appetite~. I've been really wanting a great massage & facial lately. As well as another trip to LAS VEGAS!! Last time I went I got the 50/50 deal. 50 minute massage & 50 minute facial. (I had a diff. person for each specialty too) They were both amazing. The massage was calm & soothing and the facialist was very friendly & my skin felt & looked radiant afterwards. It's about an 8 minute drive on the freeway past the strip but it was worth it! I had a car so it was easy peasy for me & it was right off the fwy so easy to find! It was about 100 dollars for both of those things. I also didn't follow spa etiquette b/c I was a bit late (due to traffic) & I also had a last apt. around 7 but they took  me anyway for the full amount of time & were very friendly still:) Great Service & I look forward to going back!. I ac assure you this is the only place to bring your pet!  It was my 1st time bringing my kitten Jack there.  From the minute I walked in they were all incredibly nice to me & of course Jack.  The technicians & Dr. Davis were amazing!  Thank you to all of you! See you in a few weeks with Jack!
If you are looking for a vet  stop looking! This is the place to go!. Einfach urig! Ein Kino wie man es nur noch selten findet. Hier laufen auch Filme abseits vom Mainstream und im OV.
Man sollte früh genug da sein, weil es keine Platzreservierung gibt. Dafür hat man dann die Qual der Wahl ;-)
Sehr zu empfehlen!. I've been here quite a few times, and I still dont know where to find it...Ok, I do know now, but it took a bit If you find the pool table, it's next to that. I think it's the 3rd floor. Anyway, sometimes there's a long line, but it moves pretty quickly. The pizza is pretty good, and if you've been drinking, it's great! It's open 24 hours, which makes it great when drunk at 3am! Seating is limited, prices are a bit steep, but it's tasty. If you haven't been, check it out. Just know what to expect and you will be delighted!. The first time I visited Green Valley Ranch, I was like, this place is nice. The casino is not very big, but there were a ton of slots for us to play. We only like playing slots and drinking while we're in Vegas. That and lay out by the pool, and swim  and drink some more. Anyway, their Feast Buffet is nice. They've got Mongolian BBQ, a tasty salad bar with fancy greens, crab legs, etc etc. The usual LV buffet fare but with more quality. They've got a small food court for those not interested in standing in a super long line or eating until your pants bust open. Also, shops are close by. Hello Anthropologie!. So here is a little backstory on why I rated this place 4 stars. Not the 1 star I had intended earlier that evening.
The boyfriend and I stopped in vegas for my 21st birthday. We are walking along the strip, Fat Tuesday in hand when a literal blanket of rain came out of nowhere. We were drenched in seconds. By the time we could get in the closest building, we were dripping (it looked like we jumped in a pool with our clothes on) wet. So we decided to hangout and shop around the hotel shops for a few minutes until the rain stopped. We eventually stumbled upon the pearl factory and I gasped with sheer delight. I did the whole pearl in the oyster in Seaworld when I was a child and got a MF BLACK PEARL I was so happy. But my dearest mother left it in the hotel after we left and it was never seen again, I was heartbroken.
So when tipsy me saw this place I wanted so badly to see if my pearl luck still ran thick. When We approached the counter(Still dripping wet from the rain) we were met with dirty looks from the saleswomen(there were 4 behind the counter only one was helping someone) Nobody said a word to us. They teated us like complete trash. I wasn't even about to wave any of them over, you could cut that awkward hate tension with a knife. After standing at the counter for a good ten minutes waiting to even be greeted, tipsy me blurted quite loudly that I would find another place that wanted my money and walked away.

Here is what saved them. A few hours later I was much more tipsy and borderline drunk(21st birthday ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) I wanted to see if the same thing would happen when we walked by again, if it did I was going to ask for every god damned manager this place had. But I was pleasantly surprised. There was a completely different woman behind the counter, she was welcoming and kind. She did the whole Aloha ceremony and it was like being a kid all over again. She dug out a HUGE cream pearl, like the size of the tip of my pinky. I immediately knew Id put it in the center of a pearl necklace I own. She understood and didn't try to sell me anything more at that point. She was wonderful. I wish I had gotten her name as I give 'Atta boys/girls' frequently. I was blown away at her service.

I will be back here next time!. Great food and service. The owner really helped us order and accomodated our family with great hospitality. It's in a hidden place near In @ Out off of Tropicana with easy parking. It is locally owned and operated so go give them some love.. We had two large trainings that we needed to professionally record.  I called Dave, AZ Video Marketing, at the last minute and he was able to accommodate our request.  We had specific requirements and Dave produced two excellent recordings within our scope.  He overcame the acoustic challenges of our training space and the sound quality of his recordings were fantastic!  He was professional and timely, arriving early to our company to set up.  His prices were reasonable and he had our recordings available within a week.  Our company will definitely use AZ Video Marketing for our future videography needs.. Hoche is one of those rare cafes that makes you feel like you could move into the neighbourhood, because you can see your life revolving around a place like this. Swinging in and out of their door, drinking their coffee and eating their sandwiches. As well as drowning uni sorrows with one of their giant choc chip cookies while you study on their wifi. 
It's like when you meet a new guy who has no visible flaws, and so your mind gets a bit carried away thinking about your lives together.
This. happened. to. me. with. this. cafe.
Tasty food, friendly staff and vibe, unpretentious. No visible flaws.

Now to get the metro back to my actual neighbourhood and step back into reality. There will be other great cafes, I know. But every now and again I will still think of Hoche and their great toasted sandwiches.. It had been some time since I've had a facial, and I figured it was time to get one again.  Summers here in the valley can be brutal, with temps reaching 115 for days in a row, its dry as a bone most of the time, and there's always a bit of dust in the air.  I've found that since moving here, with all the sweating, dirt, sunblock and stress, you really have to take care of yourself or else it catches up with you.

After searching around, most places here charge an enormous amount for a facial.  On average, I've seen them at about $85.  (some places more, some less, depending on a variety of factors.)

Somehow, I found this place.  It's close to home, has great hours, and its AFFORDABLE.  After reading the reviews, this place consistantly gets between 4 and 5 stars, and I thought, what the heck, I'm gonna treat myself.  So, I made an appt, and finally rolled in this morning.  Boy, was I glad I did!

This is place is awesome! Even though its a school, and a student does your work, it has the feel, and is run like a traditional spa/salon, but at half the price.  They have 2 different types of facials, the $33 dollar one and the $45 dollar one.  I went for the $45 dollar one for myself.  It was a full 60 minutes, and the girls here are really professional.  I was greeted immediately by the desk staff, and I only had to wait a few minutes for the girl who did my work.

She explained everything to me that she was doing throughout the facial.  I got 2 masks, some exfoliating was done, and my skin looks like a million bucks.  I got a shoulder and foot massage, along with a few other great treatments as well. I feel so refreshed, and my skin looks great.

If you have the chance, stop by here.  All the same great bonuses of the salon but at half the price.  I will be back for more, trust me!. This Saturday was my first time coming in! I previously went to the same lady for quite some time but she closed her shop so I was a bit hesitant but in desperate need of getting my brows threaded. I was immediately acknowledged & greeted by a technician named Diana. She stood out because she was Hispanic. She was very professional & asked me some questions about my experience with threading & the shape I wanted. I was happy with this detail because usually the middle eastern techs just start in. Diana was amazing with great technique! I've been getting my brows threaded for years & so I know good technique.  I hardly felt the pulling & she got all my in grown hairs out on my chin as well! She's a seasoned technician & I highly recommend her services! The shop was clean & it's a great location. The only awkwardness was there's no separation from the waiting area so people are staring at you while you are in the chair. At one point a little girl interrupted my technician for a tissue. But Diana was so patient & at the end of the day it's all good! I was in & out in no time! Also great prices!. I don't know what the lady below is talking about. I had wonderful service and the 2 ladies upfront were fantastic! They were friendly and super knowledgeable. I had my car up and running in no time with lots of progress updates along the way.. We had a wonderful experience with Chris and his crew this weekend for my birthday party. 

Chris set up 2 SUV'S for us to the Lady Antebellum concert on Sat and the overall experience was great. There was 8 of us in our party and we had more than enough room and the SUV's were very comfortable & clean. 

Kevin was our driver and he was super professional and friendly. 
We were able to continue the party with cocktails in the SUV's because they have limo licenses which was very convenient & fun. :)

I'd highly recommend this company for your next outing.. Love this place! There bread is phenomenal. Soups fresh and their portions are perfect. Every sandwich we've had has been spectacular.. I seriously can not believe any one could have a single negative thing to say about this place !! I am vegetarian and very health conscious !! It is difficult to find awesome healthy foodie spots!! The owner is there every time I visit and he always comes over to say hi and help w my order . I love there veggie burger my friends like the turkey burger and buffalo burger . Yes it's more expensive than fast food !!! Duh Becky!!! Healthy food costs more money so if you don't like it eat some where gross lol. I absolutely love this place and so do all my friends . The juices and smoothies are delicious too . 5 stars all the way !!!. Wow. As I sit here and read all these negative reviews I'm blown away. I have been with this OBGYN office for 10 months now and I am 38 weeks pregnant. I have seen every doctor at this clinic and I have no complaints about any of them. Out of all 6, my favorite 2 are Dr. Arthur Herpolsheimer and Dr. Jacob Skinner. But like I said, every doctor is fantastic. The staff is so nice. I just don't understand all of the negative backlash that they are getting. I've never worked here and no one recommended this office to me, just went off of who was covered my my insurance. Any who, if you're looking for wonderful all around staff and caring doctors who do not mind questions asked, come here. You will be pleased.. Love the crepes here! They also have great specials, and a local favorite- the pesto Brie French fries. And if you get Colleen to make you a cocktail, you won't be dissatisfied. She can make a mean drink!. I love this place. I am not a big drinker so I mostly come here for the food. Everything I have tried here has always been good, consistent and flavorful. The service is always friendly and portion sizes always force us to have left overs. I am so down with that. Try the San Francisco Burger or triple decker San Francisco grilled cheese. Both are ridiculously sinful and bad for your figure, but so worth it. Also, order steak fries with them. Yum!. Go see Rachel you will not be disappointed!  She does such an amazing job with my cut every time! I got my hair colored today for the first time with her and it turned out beautiful!  So happy!. This is a dangerous spot kids. I popped in to scope it out before a Yelp Elite event at Notorious Burgers. Super glad I had plenty of time. There's *so* much to take in here! Give yourself plenty of time to walk around. (And chuckle!) If you need a gift this place rocks!

The walls, counters and shelf space are filled with the most unique candles, mugs, signs, clothing, furniture, table-top stuff, jewelry, furniture...and well, stuff! (My list of products is deficient in covering what the store offers.) I know I said gifts. However, I wanted soooo many things for myself. The buyer of this store has sourced incredibly unique product lines. 

For example, I picked up napkins that were hilarious. (A nun holding a phone "OMG".) Making women in the store laugh was a border line inappropriate candle. (A twelve inch man with a wick in the most amusing location.) Or the sunglasses I just *had* to pick up for myself. They read "Older But-wiser" and have a distinct look of that beer to them.

What truly differentiated this store are the artist designed products.  Truly one of kind pieces are available in this store. Contact information is listed for each artist. Funky is one way to describe. Fun is definitely another. Visiting this store is truly an experience. Decorating your home with small, medium or large pieces from here will make you smile.

My favorite part (as if there could be more!) was the customer service. I'm so embarrassed to admit this. The wonderful woman who helped me was a joy. (I forgot to ask her name. Eek!) She explained the store has been family owned 24 years, in a variety of locations.

Oh! And if you'd like some clothing hemmed or altered, you can have that done here! There is an on-site seamstress. Pure awesomeness! 

Super cool place.. The food is AWESOME here! ive been happy everytime, the first time i ordered here i didnt know i had to ask for boba in my drink so i was somewhat upset about that [but the drinks were still really good], but this time i made sure to ask for boba, the only thing was that the taro slushy tasted a little... powdery lol but everything else was AMAZING! the food is super yummy, my favorite is the salt & pepper shrimp! i will deffinately order here again! :D. I didn't have high expectations for this place based on other reviews, but I loved it! I got the citrus chili shrimp tacos with a mango jicama slaw and the street corn and it all was really delicious!  We also got the ahi tuna taquitos as an app and they were great - I don't remember any seaweed in it though.  Everyone ordered different types of tacos and devoured them.  My patron cosmo drink was perfectly made - not too sweet or strong and the service couldn't have been better.  Oh and the atmosphere is both warm and fun.  The place was packed.. I like that Norm and his staff are very approachable, friendly and informative.. I would recommend this place for a fantastic mani and pedi.. During that 20min taxi ride to Pho Bosa, the only thing I could think of is this is probably not worth the trip.  Needless to say, when we arrived and faced another 45min wait, the only thing that kept me there was the fact that it was 45C & burning outside in Vegas and this tiny resto at least had AC we could seek shelter from

I was wrong; the food was just excellent.  The server was so kind and gave us tips on transportation from the resto, and we ordered their classic pho.  Texture was great and flavour was deliciously present, but the winner of the day was probably the iced Vietnamese coffee.  Not too sweet but gave us all kinds of caffeinated happiness; we decided to get their vermicelli and rice dishes for take out as a quick meal for the next day.  Even though we ate the takeout cold the next day, it was still full of flavour and enjoyable.

If you're trying to save $ in Vegas while not losing out on quality, Pho Bosa is it. Went to NYPD Pizza on 7th Ave and McDowell for lunch - Great food and AWESOME service! Despite on them being super busy I was very impressed the way Lanae helped my friend and I. She is Fantabulous! She gave us such an amazing customer service. Great job Lanae!!!. I love this shop! It is the most professional and cleanest shop I've ever been in. All the artists are super friendly and welcoming when you come in. My artist Taija is amazing. I came in to have a previous tattoo covered and 3 other artists from other shops said they wouldn't touch it, she covered it no problem and it looks so beautiful. My husband even got an amazing eagle by Duane. Both are amazing artist and this is definitely the shop to go to if you want beautiful quality work!. Great go-to brunch spot! Their omelettes are delicious, and they put them directly from the hot cast iron skillet onto your plate.. Somerset has been so kind to my family over the years.  When my daughter lost her job and insurance benefits they worked with her to make it possible to keep continue her maintenance.  Not many people have done such nice things.. This place is great if you like any type of Mongollon BBQ. The meats and selection are really good and they give you options to have chicken wings and cream cheese puffs. The price is really good as well.  For $10, all you can eat plus a drink is pretty nice.. Old school, but not old.  Like his 1961 VW bus, Eli embodies the qualities of an earlier era -  he's polite, courteous, talented and provides quality work at reasonable rates.  He's the man!. Meet with some friends on a Friday night. New to the area so Happy i found a 49er fan bar!! Tom n Jasmine our waitress really made us feel like family! I will most definitely be back...!! Keep practicing ur beer pong throw jasmine!. The mixed ceviche here is fabulous! Large, juicy pieces of shrimp and fresh fish with great spice. We ordered ours on tortilla crisps with mango, avocado slices and roasted corn and I could have eaten 4 bowls of the stuff! The steak was perfectly medium rare and my husband's salmon was moist and succulent. We didn't have room for dessert but we'll be back again soon to try some!. Friendly service and the ability to eat vegan ice cream. Normally I am left with sorbet as my only option. Standard flavors like chocolate & vanilla, but they also offer cookies & cream; peanut butter chocolate; seasalt caramel; taro and black sesame (among others).
My husband likes the macaron ice cream sandwiches (they're HUGE). My daughter and I typically split a scoop or two in a cup.
Also have banana splits, brownie sundaes, shakes, smoothies and boba teas on hand.
Offerings change daily so don't get your heart set on a certain flavor.

The only downside is that sometimes there can be a bit of a freezer burn taste. It's rare but does happen.. I have had these at various times at Yelp Elite events and they really are the best. I was very impressed at work this week when I found six boxes in the teachers lounge. They donated them for the teachers at my school. Along with that, they gave each of us a free Bundlette coupon. I was pretty floored by their generosity since I know they are not inexpensive cakes. I stopped by today to thank them and cash in my Bundlett coupon. The service I received by the delightful ladies was beyond amazing. I was very touched by the kind comments the manager made to me in regards to teachers. Gotta love Nothing Bundt Cakes for sure.. This place is the BEST GELATO EVER. For 2 reasons really.
1. Every flavor is addictive and delicious. 
2. The owners of this quaint little place are the sweeeeetest most adorable people I have ever met. 
They were needlessly friendly and helpful. Every time I come I get their strawberry. Large of course.. My absolute favorite Mexican food place!!! My family has become regulars here because the amazing friendly service an FANTASTIC food! It is a little higher priced for cold chips, plastic silverware and disposable plates but you'll let that all go when you try the food. My husband and I splurged on tickets last Saturday.  Best splurge of our trip.  I've always been a little "squimish" when it comes to their shock routines.  But I have to say, I do love their cerebral comedy.  Very smart.  Makes you think.  I love the "Bill of Rights" stuff.  I also very much love how they pull the audience into their show.  They seem like very approachable guys, and in fact, they spend a lot of time after the show making sure to talk to everyone, signing autographs, and taking pictures with friends and fans.  Nice guys.  

I'm not one of those people who buys a program at shows, but I have to say that the ten bucks I spent on their program was probably the ten most well-spent dollars I "lost" in Vegas.  I'm still enjoying it a week later.  I've read it over a couple of times and find that I'm even more endeared to Penn & Teller than I was before.  They're brutally honest.  You just don't find that in the entertainment world anymore.  Thanks for a very fun, two hour "escape".. We had the triple T fries, bacon mac n cheese burger, tatooed turkey burger. Food was amazing! Nick our server was wonderful. Definitely come back and recommend to others.. These guys were great!  I had an unusual situation where I needed them to come 3 different times in 2 days to help me move furniture in and out of my place as I was getting all new flooring and carpeting done.  They were very adaptable and always aiming to please.  The 3rd time was a sort of last minute call to them to come back and help me, and they managed to work it into their schedule to do it.  I had Zack and Robert - they were very helpful and very nice.  I definately recommend them for any kind of moving.. I'm yet another person who got their first taste of Fort McDowell Adventures at the Yelp Western Adventures event. And now I'm dying to go back for one of their Adult Education nights.

This place is gorgeous. The two main areas have a classic old west feel and there's just something really nice about the desert setting. 

While I can't comment on the rum bus (which I definitely need to hit up next time I head out there), I am truly, madly, deeply in love with the tequila bus. The only thing better than the idea of partying on a school bus driving around in the desert while drinking tequila is the actual experience.. Amazing food! The fish fry is the best fried fish I've had, I didn't even need to use the lemon for flavor, the fish had it all on its own. I love the Irish vibe and drafts, the patio is relaxing. Great staff and security, never drama and drinks are reasonable price. I feel you pay for the scenery and atmosphere, totally worth it.. GIANT-SIZED PORTIONS!

Thank goodness my sis-in-law and I split our food because the portions are seriously large enough to feed two people.

We ordered their chicken katsu loco moco, which I have never seen on a menu back in Seattle. Everything in this dish was perfect! I love how the katsu had the right amount of crispiness to it. I definitely would order this again for my next visit...and come on an empty stomach.  I also ordered a side of their mac salad and I wasn't a fan of it. It had a little bit of a sweetness to it and I personally didn't like that.

For dessert, we and two other people at our table split a piece of their guava cake. So GOOD! I'm glad we ended dinner on that note.. Okay, I can't stop coming back to this place.  I've tried to duplicate the broth at home and just can't!!!! They know me by face now... I come here with the hubby once a week.  It's just the best darn ramen ever!   The chashu is immoderate but I come here for the broth and the ramen.  The food is so simple yet so complex.  It's perfect!  I do wish they have agedashi tofu on the menu.  Monta read my review- add agedashi tofu to your menu, just use the shoyu broth.  It'll match well.  -M2. What is it about VinciTorios that I love so much? See, it isn't just ONE thing....it's everything. My husband and I eat here about once a month. Sometimes an early dinner and sometimes the lunch buffet. And everytime we go we say "We ought to eat here more often" This time we are sticking to it! 
I arrived last night around 6 with no reservation. My husband was coming from somewhere else and so first to arrive grabs the table. (This is a small place and nowhere to wait for a table, so either you make reservations or go early for dinner!) I managed to get the last available table (yay!) and was seated promptly. And as always greeted by the owner. We ordered a drink (wine and beer only, no full bar) and I had what I always order: the tortellini aurora. Oh man, this is so yum...cheese tortellini w/ fresh mushrooms and peas in a tomato cream sauce. My husband (who always orders some sort of veal) decided to be different and order the lasagna. Delicious! 
When I looked around the place, there were tables of people laughing talking and enjoying the atmosphere and food. The open seating makes you feel like part of a big family. And our waiter (sorry I am having a senior moment and can't recall his name, but he has been our waiter before) was delightful as always. Attentive and friendly. When we left the owner once again thanked us for coming in. It is almost like we were his guests. 
The only issues are: parking can be a little difficult on a weekend night as it is close to the cheap movie theater. And the live entertainment is not necessary and not that good. The man on the electric guitar singing 60-70 hits by John Sebastian or the Beatles was really out of place. I like the house canned music so much better!. This is my absolute favorite breakfast place... ever!! The biggest and most amazing chorizo burrito I have ever had! Eggs, chorizo, cheese and hash brown in a huge tortilla. I have never been disappointed with this burrito. I live in Laveen and we drive over on saturday mornings to get this! I also love the burgers as well. I usually order the bacon cheeseburger... I love crispy bacon and that is exactly what you get! They are not cheap with the cheese either! Large portions, I suggest ordering the smaller fries...the small is huge! I love this place! 

They do have a huge menu! Something for everyone...... I want to give a huge thanks and hug to Jonathon who was my stylist.  I explained to him my sister is getting Married in 3 weeks due to her Beast cancer.  I needed a a dress that she would like, fit and be altered in time.  He was extremely patient, and understanding.  I never felt rushed as he gave his undivided  attention to me.  He found the perfect dress and was able to have it customized by suggesting we add a different color satin sash to the waist.  It truly made all the difference.  He is a God send!

Thanks so much!
Julia B. Finally found a place that has baristas that know how to steam soy milk! The espresso was smooth and perfectly pulled. The soy milk latte was velvety and delicious. Next time I may order a cappuccino to get even more of that tasty foam.. I hope to never move again (ugh), but if I do, I will use Camelback Moving.  I paid exactly what I was told I would.  No hidden costs, fees, "extras," nothing.  The 3 man crew showed up on time and looked professional.  They were respectful of me, my things and how stressful moving is.  They worked quickly and efficiently and were so much fun.  The three man team had a great rapport with each other and made us laugh every step of the way.  I have nothing but praise for a job well done and would recommend them to anyone.. A coworker and I stopped in here for lunch today after hearing about it from a friend. The parking situation was pretty rough but after circling the block once or twice we got a spot. Right off the bat I noticed the authentic vibe of the place and the menu was super unique. Of course I got the enchiladas as did most of the patrons as far as I could tell. They let you customize the ingredients from the stuffing to the cheeses to the salsas and toppings. They also bake the enchilada right there in front of you once they make it. I ended up getting the spinach mushroom stuffing and it was absolutely delicious. I really want to give a five star but the prices and parking bring it down to four...for now. I will definitely be back.. was treated for my bday.  and man, oh man... was it a treat.  

started it with the heirloom tomato salad.  wowza.  and a serious portion too.  the duck salad was great too.  it was like duck bacon.  what more can you ask for?  went on to the seafood tasting and the halibut.  both delicious.

but the real shocker was dessert.  three words for you... fried. peach. pie.. A Jersey girl in a cowboy bar...One would never think.  However, this Jersey girl checked out the newest restaurant/nightlife addition to Old Town Scottsdale...Saddle Ranch Chop House.  And I have 2 words...LOVED IT!  

This restaurant/bar first garnered attention in Hollywood.  

I didn't have the opportunity to eat there, but I did enjoy a frothy beverage!  The patio is big...and the selling point is a mechanical bull!!  Great western bar, fun atmosphere and a bull!

I will update my review once I eat there.  But you must go!!

**UPDATE***  
GO ON SUNDAY BRUNCH!!!  $1.99 Mimosa and Bloody Mary's....The food is good too!. great service, fun late night place to grab a bite of authentic irish food

the prices are really good, especially for the size and deliciousness of the food you get.

definitely not a bad place to swing by in Vegas!

try the guinness stew!

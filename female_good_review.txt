This is one of our quick weekend spots when we're craving junk food. The shoestring fries are perfectly crisp and they have a great veggie burger for non-meat eaters. We've never tried the custard so I can't attest to that aspect of the restaurant, but their special sauce and seasoning salt keeps us coming back. The prices are great too!. Yes, a restaurant on Sunset in Henderson that has excellent food and service. Emphasis on excellent food.

I have dined at Todd's several times and each time the one page menu has changed to offer various specials and what's in season.

My most recent trip here was for dinner before a show. We were a few minutes late for our 7:00pm reservation and were seated right away. [Side note, my phone is notorious for its short battery life so I tend to keep an emergency charger with me in my purse. The hostess at Todd's was very accomodating and plugged in/charged my phone for me during our dinner.]

I started with a cantalope martini then switched to prosecco during my meal. We ordered:

-crabcake
-house salad
-spicy skirt steak
-white fish from Alaska (one of the specials for the night)

I will upload a pic of our main entrees. Everything was very light and fresh, even the skirt steak didn't feel heavy or overwhelming. Our waitress was on point and even though the restaurant was completely packed she stayed on top of things.

All that said, I am not a huge fan of Todd's decor. I feel that ambiance can be a very important component to one's entire dining experience when at a particular establishment. As a result, the generic, kind of tired fabric, on the booth seats at Todd's is not attractive. Everything is clean but there were areas that looked a bit worn.. I visit this restaurant frequently, as it is the closest Asian restaurant to my residence. Aside from the convenient location, I enjoy this place because of its good food. Their Chinese dishes are tasty and their sushi is fresh. This is not the place to go for a gourmet meal, but it is a step above your average Asian carryout. 

The restaurant is clean and well kept. Staff are friendly and inviting. This place is consistent in their service and taste. Highly recommended for dining in or carryout.. Awesome, awesome, awesome!  Three coworkers and myself went here after a day of meetings and they got us all right in and they were all terrific!  Each of us had a great massage!  Highly recommend this place!!. I am in Vegas for work and am getting tired eating alone so since ESPN Zone is next to my hotel, I went to try it out. I love sports and was happy to see many TVs fearuring many different sports games that were going on. I sat at the bar and had a tall draft and the black and blue burger. They just changed the keg so my beer was perfect. The food was really good too. I aS pleasantly surprised!  With the sandwich you got to choose your side so that was nice since I am cutting back on fries!  Overall the experience was great and I'd go back.. Great drinks, delicious food (especially homemade nachos), and excellent service. Jessie and Miles were so friendly and accommodating. Would come back just for the service alone.. I'll keep this one short &simple as my love for Vegas is waning after 4 visits and getting married there. Made a reservation easily 24 hrs in advance. Seated immediately. Ordered the penne with sausage &peppers, and a Caesar salad also a Campari martini. S.o. Ordered a Caesar salad as well and the lasagna. The server was warm yet professional, and accommodated us politely. ( I have a very thirsty companion and prefer to not have onion anywhere in my food). 

I'm not a pasta fan but the pastas both were punchy with Classic Italian flavors, were perfectly cooked and heated. The bread basket had a nice mix of items. I'd def go back if we revisit Vegas again.. Maybe the rooms were not as good as it gets, but who goes to Vegas to stay in the room? The lobby is not your average mole hole casino type entrance. It's beautifully done in cream colored stone and elegant chandeliers. Tons of natural light which is rare in Vegas. 

If you have kids, stay here just for the wave pool, it's the best pool in Vegas. I won't stay at another hotel in Vegas if Mandalay Bay is available. 

The only complaint I have, and the reason I knocked off a star, relates to the front desk. Both check-in and check-out were a hassle and the staff was not at all apologetic. In fact, on check in they refused to extend our stay at the rate I was paying only to find out by calling reservations from our room that it was no problem. The check-out line took almost 45 minutes because so many people dispute charges.

 But hey, there are like 3000 rooms in the place so I am not too surprised.. This is an extremely caring group of doctors. We have been coming here for 10 years now and they have been caring for my Bichon through all of her illnesses and problems. Whenever she needs to be seen, they make sure they get us in.  They are patient and kind. I have seen every doc in the practice and I really like them all but I am partial to Dr Patterson. She is so completely loving and patient with us and I really feel her empathy for us. I highly recommend this group to anyone who is looking for a great veterinary clinic.. This was my favorite spot of my Vegas vacation. My boyfriend and I headed to the Luxor, we were planning on eating at the Pyramid Cafe. Unfortunately they had changed their hours and we had come a little to late. Bummed, we started to work our way to the food court when we happened to spot the Public House. The menu was on display outside and we immediately agreed to eat here instead. 

It is a very open restaurant with big screen TVs covering the walls. Our server Rian was amazing! She greeted us immediately got our drinks and started our appetizer (Mac n' Cheese squares!) The fried Mac n' Cheese squares came 5(?) to a plate (I cant remember they were basically gone the second they were put on our table) They came with a buffalo wing sauce and a chipotle ranch sauce. Entrees followed soon after.

I had the turkey burger, with guacamole, smoke gouda, on an onion bun. I opted to substitute my fries for a healthier side salad, My boyfriend had the angus burger with the fries. Everything was simply amazing. My boyfriend complained about his onions (not regular raw onions but a sauteed onion placed under the cheese) I do not hold this against the restaurant because our server had asked if everything on the burger was ok for him, he said yes. I did steal a few fries off my boyfriends plate and they were perfectly cooked in my opinion, extra crunch on the outside without getting the overcooked feel. (definitely the best french fry i had the entire trip)

When we went this restaurant was only opened for 15 days, I wish this restaurant the best and I hope I get the chance to eat here again. We couldn't stop raving about the food/service the rest of our trip!. I visited Calico Corners about a week ago because I'm in to sewing, and this place was located near my hotel so I decided to check it out.

First of all, I would not consider CC a "fabric store" in the traditional sense. They don't sell zippers or sewing machines or accessories for home sewing.  They do, however, sell fabric.

The home interior fabrics they sell are absolutely beautiful and high quality. This is a great place to get ideas for home decor projects (if you're a diy-er like me) and a fantastic place to order custom draperies or upholstery work (if you would prefer to let someone else do the work).

In the back of the store they have clearance fabric where I scored a huge deal on some beautiful upholstery fabric for pillows. Quantities are limited. 

CC gets 5 stars because of their great customer service. Sales associate Robin was extremely friendly and helpful. When I was checking out she asked for my phone number and contact information. Normally I don't give out that stuff but the computer system stores a record of which fabrics you purchase. I thought it might be helpful in the future if I wanted to get more of the fabric or something. So I gave her my info.

I left the store and checked out of my hotel and headed out to the airport. At the airport I received a call from Robin to let me know I left my credit card at CC. I asked her if she could mail it to me and she did! Just received it today.

I was happy I didn't have to cancel any of my auto-payments or worry about where I had lost my card. I appreciate Robin going the extra mile to get my card back to me!. Wow a movie should be watched this way!. Oh man-if it wasn't for the price, I'd give this 5+ stars! I just had my first massage here and it was amazing! I got a deep tissue massage from Sarah, and it was just what I needed. I'm a regular rock climber and live a pretty active lifestyle and the knots in my back are no joke. I'll be coming back here probably once a month :).. really good food my little girl loves their empanadas.  those are super delicious.  their food is fresh and good.  their staff is always very helpful.. Thank you mood swing salon. I called at the last minute for a hair color appointment and manicure and everyone was more than accommodating fitting me in that same day. Definitely will be back.. Visited Ranias after a purchasing a Groupon for the restaurant. The food was delicious, hot, amd fresh. I had the beed sirloin kabob platter with about 6 good sized pieces of sirloin and amazingly seasoned brown rice. The naan was served hot, fresh from the oven and was absolutely delicious! Several beers on tap and bottle choices as well. I would definitely visit again!!!!. LOVE this place! Took my brother here to celebrate his achievements. Richy was our waiter and he was very kind and helpful. The setting is very classy and elegant, I love the fact that its not dark like most other "fancy" restaurants we could actually see each other in here. The food was amazing I love the lobster bisque and the salmon was perfect! Definitely coming back.. Yes!! Go here! Order anything and it will be delicious. Guacamole and horchata are highlights!. I love this place and have since I was a kid, hope I'm not dating my self here....lol.  Any who growing up on the west side of town, I loved going to beauregrad's to eat, from the salads, to the burgers everything is just great.  I try and visit Beauregard's every time I go to visit my grandma, I went to see her this past Saturday so I decided that I needed a Beauregard's grilled chicken salad in my life.  I knew that they had the Murder Mystery thing going on, but I didn't think it was as big as it is.  So I called my food in like I always do, and went to pick it up about 10 minutes later.  I got there and it was no where to park, this is something that I'm not use to.  So I had to park further down then I was use to, I think the spaces made just for pick up were all taken up by the murder mystery people.....shame.  Any who, I got out the car and wow there was a crowd of people waiting to get in the door.  It made me feel like this was the last place to eat at on Freedom Dr.  Can any one say fire hazard?  Tried to get in the door, and the rude people waiting at the door were too snooty to be there.  But I gave them the benefit of a doubt, made my way in the door no one wanting to move, or being nice enough to do so.  So I had to push my way in, got the same excellent service as I always do.  Leaving I had to again push my way through the door, the rudest people ever.  Made me say hmm I don't think I want to go back if I'm visiting my grandma on the weekend again.  But I shouldn't let butt holes ruin my time with Beauregard's.  I just wish they could better plan this event, make it so that the people waiting to see this show come in on the other side of the building and let the other door be for those who aren't there to see the show, and those who just want take out.  Other than that, the food was great as always, I ate it so fast I don't remember what it taste like.  Made me want a do over, but I didn't want to go through that crazy crowd again.. I traveled with my pet and had a great experience.  Customer service was great and I love the size of the seats. Pretty good place! I just hate once you are almost done with the drink and you add a extra shot it tastes horrible but does the trick to have a nice cool drink while walking the strip. Will definitely come back on my future Vegas trips. Ok I know its all hyped up but I really enjoyed my two experiences here and I'll you why....
First independent of the restaurant there is a Sugar bar inside of the Paris casino that's connected to the restaurant (its the back side) you can get all your food served at the bar there. We had happy hour there but no food. Bartender was super friendly and happy hour was buy one get one free of their amazing cocktails. Roughly you pay about 10 bucks a drink with happy hour prices and tip but the drinks are HUGE and i was done done after 1.5 of them. They were delicious and whimsical (Swedish Fish Cherry thing was wow) and the smores martini packs quite a punch!

Moving along to the restaurant...Saturday morning it was packed! However we were sat really quickly....but then we were ignored for 20 min....through no fault of the waitress though they didnt tell her they broke up a large table and had begun seating in her section. She quickly put our order in and the food came out really quick (but i did see other tables wait ions for their food...I guess since they front loaded our wait time we got to have an expedited order)
Food was really good and not expensive. I had a Raspberry creme brulee crepe which was rich but light. Not too heavy (finished the whole thing!) and the raspberry sorbet it was topped off with was the perfect compliment to the warm crepe. We also had chicken tenders and the basket was full!! We got like 6 or 7 pieces and couldn't polish them off. 
Anywho I will definitely be back to the bar and restaurant. Fanaminal holistic treatment for the mind and body.  Here are all the things they fixed for me, could you imagine how much time, money, stress, I'd spend elsewhere with probably no results:  10+ years of chronic back pain, ankle pain, calve pain, body feeling like it's falling a part, anxiety issues, fatigue, no motivation, feeling like I'm not getting smarter but going the opposite direction, wanting to quit my job from burnout, skipping words when I write or read.  Also gave me hope that there was light at the end of the tunnel and just asked for 6-8 weeks, sure enough all the items I had told Dr Barry about were fixed by then.  After that I told Dr Teams about some of the other issues and he helped me with those.  I still go to Dr Berry after or before a big athletic thing I need to do or to just checkin so I never get far off track and they can remind me of the habits I need to keep up with to take care of myself.   I can't thank you all enough!. This post is long overdue! Got my hair done by Cherin and she was great!  She squeezed me in last minute for a partial highlight and root touch up and she did an amazing job!. Never had to wait in line for more than 5 minutes. They have always served me decent portions. The food is always great and if they end up giving me something that wasn't what I wanted, they had never given me any problem about fixing my orders. The waiters have always been friendly too. It's in a not-so-ideal location, but it doesn't even matter to me. It's definitely worth the drive! Try the Thai-style fried rice! Always a favorite for me. Or the garlic beef. Yum!. Drunken singing and chicken dancing, pounding of HUGE steins, sausages, standing on chairs, jager shots followed by getting wacked with a wooden paddle.... What more can you ask for???

We have an Awesome time every time we come here! A must stop for us every trip to Vegas. Hard Rock is right across the street. Perfect for some drunken gambling!. I am soooo surprised this Resort is not reviewed yet!!!! We came here on a special through Travelzoo.com and paid $65.00 a night because it was a special for the Christmas weekend. Let me just say that I was blown away by the standards of this Hotel and Resort. It has been open for 9 months and is amazing!!!!! The room is plush, the bathrooms has a tub with this that you can see through this glass window and if you want privacy there is a shade that is remote to you. The is a TV and seperate enclosure for the toilet and the shower. And believe me..... I am really anal about bathrooms. The view of our room is the strip with the largest decorated Christmas tree! Killer view and right below that is the pool that has unique design. You basically do not have to leave the hotel. Great spot for a romantic weekend getaway! Will not think twice about coming back again! Much better than staying on that crowded strip.... it just 9 miles away. So not that far!. Third time since 2009 and always leave full and happy. Even the bleu cheese salad leaves you wanting more because it's so good.. FUN!! For what you pay for it's definitely worth it. Joe (our host) was so full of energy and was funny as hell! Between clubs he was passing out drinks left and right and he definitely kept the energy up. We hit up Drai's at first stop. I wish this would have been our second or last stop because it was definitely the sickest club. Second was tryst. Eh, it was kinda whack. Way too small with way too many people. But it was my birthday and I was tipsy so it was alright. Then we hopped back on the party bus. At that time everybody was wasty-cakes so it was fun as hell. Joe was a pro at keeping the party going. We went next to Chateau, it was cool..but after all of the insanity hubby and I had to bounce for some drunchies at Earls. Overall, really fun experience. I loved the wide range of age groups too. 21- early 40's. Made it more interesting. Will definitely do again!. I have never, ever not enjoyed myself at Petra's! Its grown up & sexy, 21 & up, the atmosphere & ambiance are on point and its generally just the perfect place for a night out! Great date night place for an intimate experience, especially for LGBT, but I think anyone could enjoy themselves here!. Thank you to the Findlay Kia service department for a job well done.  
Made my appointment online but it didn't let me know that recall appointments stopped at 3:30.  Online, it let me make it at 4:20.
When I got there they explained this to me but Jose M. said they would take me anyway.
He said it would be about 2-1/2 hours.
Low and behold, a little over an hour later it was done.  He put 2 guys on my car to handle both of the recalls.
Thank you to Jose M. and his service department for a great experience!. Hey you know that sports bar with a just-okay beer selection but really yummy potato skins and ranch cheese fries and nachos that all of the teachers hang out at because they give them half off of those yummy apps?

Oh yeah, sports page. Let's go. Meet you at 4:30.. I am in love with the Hawaiian BBQ Sandwich! So delicious! My husband enjoys the Italian most of the time but is liking the Canonballs return as well! Very good sandwiches... And don't be intimidated by the line... They are usually moving pretty quick to get you in and out.. I've never eaten here, but I've seen a few shows and had drinks here. There was one server who was pretty undesirable, but I was informed that she no longer works there. The rest of the staff is very warm and welcoming. The drinks are always good. The Rigby draws a crowd, but never really feels packed. The location is fantastic.  The live performances are intimate. Overall, a great place to spend a Saturday night or a nice Sunday afternoon (all day happy hour prices).. Big portions with good prices.   Crowded on a Friday evening, but prompt service with attentive staff.   The Monkey Balls are amazing!  They do offer more entrees than just sushi so if you are not a sushi fan don't let that deter you from dining there.. I am giving this spa two stars, not one bc the quality of the treatment has always been good. However, the scheduling itself has been a huge disappointment. I use Yelp quite a bit and appreciate the fact that I can use the app to book appointments. However, they only allow scheduling on the hour and you have to call to book an appointment on the half hour. Okay, no big deal. So I call and make a same day appointment for a hydra facial and a massage. As I'm on my way to the spa, the front desk girl calls me and apologizes that there has been a mixup and they can no longer accommodate my appointments at that time. She offers to put a note in my file and promised that next time I come in, " they will do something super nice for me." A week later I decide to try booking the hydra facial this time through Yelp. I receive my confirmation email and I head in. When I get there they have no record of my appointment ever being made. I show them my confirmation email and luckily they were able to still get me in during that time. This is now the second time that something has happened to my booking. They also could not locate in my file that anything was noted from last time. The owner said that she will do something nice for me but instead of saying she will look into her Yelp booking problems, she advises me to not use them instead! I reminded her that the first booking problem was solely a staff issue and not associated with Yelp. I have booked many appointments with Yelp and have never had a problem until now. So I finish my hydra facial and the aesthetician also tries to push $140 worth of products on me and just assumed I was going to buy all of them in addition to my $225 hydra facial. They did discount my facial to $150. Thinking that was their attempt at making up for the two mistakes, I found out that the discount is actually given to all first time hydrafacial bookings. So what happened to the two promises that " something super nice will be done?" Apparently the front desk girl and the owner both had long forgotten about that after my one hour appointment. In hindsight I probably should've not given in to sales pressure and left the products and also spoke up more regarding the booking mistakes but I'm just not the type of person that likes to voice my concerns in front of a full lobby of clientele waiting to enjoy their spa visit. I do however realize that this is worth mentioning on Yelp in hopes that they will improve their booking processes. Who wants to look forward to a spa day, only to find out 10 min before your appointment that too bad, bc the customer before you decided to upgrade their hydrafacial, now you either can't have one that day or I need to cancel other arrangements to relax. I think the aesthetician needs to check her bookings before upselling her current client's facial. I really wanted to like this spa enough to purchase a membership bc I'm a frequent spa goer do to my high stress profession, but it didn't seem like the owner and her staff really wanted to make up for their mistakes.

UPDATE: 
The owner did call me in attempt to make this right again and offered to give me a free spa service on my next visit. She also left me her personal number to make sure my concerns were addressed. I really appreciate her willingness to make her business better and will try them again bc the services have always been wonderful.. Chris was great!  He was pleasant, courteous, prompt, and did a great job of repairing my carpet.  I would highly recommend him.. There are whole range of tours that are offered in Edinburgh Old Town and even as you go round this tour you will see others plodding the same route. It seemed to me we were having the most fun on ours! 

Our tour guide was a 19th century head of the Edinburgh' cemetery named Alexander Clapperton who introduced us to a several ridiculous characters along the route from the castle, down the mile and through the alleyways and courtyards I hadn't known existed. 

He talks about a whole range of things from the role of the foul clangers (I won't tell you, don't want to spoil the fun) to the fighting tactics of the armies during the Highland clearances. 

This is a really interesting and genuinely funny way to get to know a bit about Edinburgh's history. I had my doubts before we started but I was crying with laughter and had learnt a few facts I hope will win me some pub quizzes. Whether you are here for a weekend or you're a local I would highly recommend this for a thoroughly entertaining evening.

If you have an Edinburgh Pass it is free. I love this place.  The employees are sweet.  The food is filling, everything is amazing about this place!  Nothing more and nothing less.. I was pleasantly surprised with our stay here. Having never stayed with this brand of hotel I didn't know what to expect, but I'm glad we took a chance. Plus, the pictures on the internet weren't bad either.  :)

The surrounding location is okay.  It's near a business area and other motels. I had no problem walking my dog past 10:30pm. The rooms are VERY clean with nice white clean sheets and comfy beds, and I love the fact that my dog got to stay with us in the room (with no extra charge).  :)  Also, the free breakfast was great! I got fresh waffles and during my stay here I had fresh biscuits and gravy. Kinda glad they had a little bit of a rotation on  the food too. I got scrambled eggs and bacon one morning too.  Bacon makes everything better! LOL (sometimes. LOL) They have a great selection of pastries, cereal, etc.

If I'm ever back in the area, I will not hesitate to stay here. And the price is just right! Thanks, Arizona!  :). Two words. LOVE IT!  Just be sure to buy you're tickets/reserve your seats well ahead of time or you'll be disappointed when you get there.. This place is always fantastic. I love the pretzles with beer cheese at happy hour. They have a decent beer selection. They are always on a wait when I come here, but its worth it! The vibe around the fire and backyard games make it a great vibe for friends and family.. I've noticed some of the reviews say best for older children but i've been taking my son since before he could walk and absolutely love it! He has the greatest time. Even though he doesn't quite understand the science behind everything, he loves running around and pressing all the buttons. The weather machine is his favorite. During the warmer months he loves playing in the ball fountain. We started going here after getting a free cultural pass at the library and loved it so much we ended up getting a membership. It is definitely worth it to get a membership. We go a few times a month and it never gets old. You can find discounts on memberships on living social before the holidays. We've gotten our memberships for 50-30% off over the past two years. 

If you have a toddler best time to come is when school is in session and after 1pm. This place gets packed with school groups in the mornings.. I just had to write an update to my review because I had a different esthetician today, Jane. She was absolutely amazing! I love being a member here. The staff is always upbeat and friendly and so professional. I was wary about having someone besides Jessie because I've been going to her for about a year. Jane absolutely exceeded my expectations. My eyebrows look great from the wax and my skin feels so good from the facial. She even gave me a card with beauty recommendations on it to help my skin, it was amazing. I've already booked my next appointment and really wish I could write a review each time I go because this company definitely knows how to treat their customers. Thank you so much to the Hand and Stone South Park team!. Since I've been in Vegas I've tried several different nail salons and always go back to Premier Nails. They provide a great service, fair prices and the salon is CLEAN! I drive from Summerlin to have my nails done by Danny.. The place to go for Hainan chicken rice! If you are a big fan of Hainan chicken, it's no doubt that you have heard of the famous Savoy Kitchen in Los Angeles. However, Vegas doesn't serve very tasty Hainan chicken but Big Wong definitely will satisfy your craving if you cannot make it to Savoy Kitchen instantly! 

I always order the Hainan chicken rice and seasonal stir-fry vegetables. I also really love the salt and pepper chicken wings, chicken curry with roti, and the sweet roti with condensed milk. There are quite a few things I don't particularly like from here, such as the beef noodles thatt tasted very bland when I tried it. However, the good things weigh out the bad and you cannot beat the price of their dishes! 

I don't suggest coming here if you are someone who is looking for a spot with excellent customer service, as many authentic Asian places don't carry that to begin with. Give this place a try and I'm sure you'll enjoy the food and won't leave with a hole in your wallet!. Kudos for being another 3am joint. They fulfill orders fast and stay open late and the food is good. Great theme idea for a college campus. They also have veggie burgers, which is cool.They definitely have to work on building a cohesive image and planning their interior to bring the theme to fruition. Nevertheless, the food is good. I'm bumping up a star because the service is really great.. I called so many people about my laptop fan issue, and the prices I kept hearing were over $100. I could not bring myself to pay that much. I bought the fan already and all I needed was for someone to install it. 

I finally found this company which was right in my price range! I was so happy, and drove straight to them. He told me it would be a hour or so to install it. I walked around the plaza, which has tons of shopping. 

Did my shopping and returned to pick up my fixed laptop. It works just fine and I know which company has my business from now on.. Four stars for delicious margaritas and cornbread.
I wasn't a fan of the mexican food here, to be honest.  I did enjoy the pork tenderloin stuffed with sausage though!. Very good!  Had the three taco combo - chicken mole, asada and carnitas.  The mole was great.  Loved the green salsa on the asada.  Carnitas was pretty good, but not my fave of the three.  Yummy chips, but wish they'd given a few more.  Watermelon juice is delish!  Will definitely go back for more.. The food is very good. I wasn't particularity thrilled with my fish, because I like a little lighter fish, but the mixture it was cooked in, Monterey style, was delicious. And my friend's fish was quite good, along with the Caribbean style. The appetizer platter was fabulous, and I now understand why they are known for their crab cakes. The service was fabulous! April, our waitress, along with another gentleman that serviced our table, were very patient and kind with all of our needs. 
And the view.... Wow.. One of the best japanese I've ever been! It's not cheap but you must go! The rice is amazing and something simple as salmon nigiri could become astonishing! Nice atmosphere and good romanian wine!. Dog friendly. No extra charge. Resort fee 25 bucks but includes bikes you can use to cruise through old Town scottadale. Pool is awesome but the gym is not well air conditioned. Happy hour 3-6 everyday but the margaritas are half ice. Good service and a cute coffee shop in the lobby.. The smells coming from the stand are amazing - then the tacos are yummy and authentic. Love the Strip District eateries.. I Love this place! Very friendly environment with great service! They have delicious brisket and they are very generous with the side portions :). I had a very different experience here, but I did not order from the buffet I ordered to go I had takiki Marsala, Channa Marsala and some lovely veg samosas. This was the first time I went to this place the food was good...some of the best that I have tasted. I will definitely go to this place again the staff was friendly and I guess I am going to have to try the buffet.. So many great finds in this place! From cute cards to kitchenware, to in-house made sandwiches and croissants, you can find a great gift for anyone in here. The prices can be a bit spendy, but this is a locally owned business with unique items--prices will be a bit higher because of it! 

My only complaint is the winter hours, but I get why that's probably necessary.. OMG Delicious.......+GREAT SERVICE +......The Best Las Vegas has to offer !  
Their Pizza is GREAT, their service is great....friendly service, + delicious Pizza and the Manager Matt is A W E S O M E.   Our family will be steady customers of this Location on Lake Meade.   It's hard to find a great pizza out here in the Las Vegas Valley....BUT WE FOUND IT !  Thanks Matt for your great service and great crew and GREAT PIZZA!  Now go see for yourselves.....you will love it!. Have you been searching for a cozy little coffee shop in the Spring Valley area? One with a vast selection of quality drinks, comfortable environment, inviting ambiance, and convenient hours? Oh, and staff that are genuinely friendly and accommodating? 

Well, Aromas Teas and Coffee IS the coffee shop you're looking for (no Jedi mind trick required to believe it)!

Feda, the owner, took my order and made my caramel Shakerato (their version of flavored iced lattes) one dreary Sunday afternoon. It was the perfect pick-me-up: sweet, but not too sweet (don't you hate overly sweet drinks that make you feel like you're melting the enamel right off your teeth with each sip?), milky, the perfect size, and served with a smile. 

After chatting with Feda for a bit, I learned that they are almost ready with their bakery (opening somewhere on Sahara Ave.) which will be their source of locally made pastries! I will be back...

Take some time to check out this family owned coffee shop!. This is my favorite pool on the strip, I love all the palm trees and the waterfalls.  This place is so peaceful and tranquil.  I love coming here first thing in the morning with my coffee when it's not so crowded.  You have to show your room key to get in.. This is a super friendly little place.  I know the category says it's Brazilian food, but it's actually Colombian.  And apparently the Colombians don't believe in small portions.  When I first saw the prices on the menu I was kind of surprised, they were more expensive than similar places I've been to.  I had a to go order and I understood the pricing when the waitress brought out four separate boxes with all my food in them.  

It was really tasty stuff too.  I had never had Colombian food before and was pleasantly surprised.  A little on the salty side, but still really good.  The restaurant itself is really cute too.  It kind of looks like an old Spanish country house.  The waitress was very helpful and sweet.  She gave me some really good suggestions.. Crust is around the corner from my house and we felt like grabbing a bite to eat last night so we thought we'd give it a try. Boy are we glad we ventured over there! 

You walk in and it's very nicely decorated with some high top tables, some booths and some regular sized tables. There is also bar space where you can sit and enjoy a drink and appetizer or even dinner. The service was great. Very attentive. They gave us plenty of time to look over the menu and it was much needed. There were so many things that I wanted to order! 

I narrowed it down to the skinny guy sandwich which is Grilled chicken, sauteed eggplant, roasted peppers & fresh mozzarella drizzled with extra virgin olive oil & balsamic vinegar. I got it on whole wheat and the bread was fresh and soft. The fresh basil and fresh mozzarella definitely made this sandwich. It was amazing. I also had a small greek salad and the tomatoes were farm fresh and the dressing was light and flavorful. 

My boyfriend had the steak sandwich which was Filet mignon, mushrooms & onions with melted mozzarella servedon garlic bread. He barely spoke the entire meal because he was shoveling the sandwich in. He even went so far as saying that it was the best sandwich he's had in a long time!

The portion sizes were huge and the appetizers looked rather large as well. The wine was a little pricey but they have monthly wine selections on special and they also had a wine special for the day for $5 a glass which was great! We will DEFINITELY be back and plan to make this a frequent happy hour stop. I can't wait to try the chicken francese served over linguine. It looked amazing!!

Oh, and the canolis are 1.25 and a perfect way to round out the dinner. It's tiny but well worth the 1.25 and to me a perfect size for a little sweet snack after dinner.. I have been to this then-new-ish very dark venue a few times since '13 to support local bands or larger bands who have come to Phoenix.  I have never eaten here and I will just review the first 2 shows to begin with during my visits...
I first came here in November 2013 when the 1st-generation Los Angeles band, X, came to town to perform their punk music hits they released since the 1970s, with fellow punkers, The Blasters, as their opening act.  The following year, I came back to watch the 3 local bands on one night: Cherie Cherie, Man Hands, and French Girls.  Every one of them all gave a solid true professional performance each.  I believe, again, the way a venue treats a band influences the bands' level of conducts when performing a gig.  The ticket prices were fair.  The shows started on time (thanks for not being too loud).  The staff was professional and organized.  Security was there (for 'X') but not that sorely needed (there was this one guy who kept trying to get people to move a bit out of the way, as if he's worried about fire exits- one attendee did get a bit mad at him for repeatedly touching him to move.  Putting down a rope like in a movie theater might've avoided this hassle).  I am impressed that everyone was well-behaved and got along(!)  This makes my evenings leaving me feeling pleasant and relaxed- which is why I go out, to have a nice time away from the everyday antics (wink).  The bleachers were a cool idea (my preference, too, instead of on the floor/pit for my safety's sake), and I stood on it to take great photos, as well as so I could see the performers more.  They usually leave tables / chairs for small acts, but for the larger ones, you only have the bleachers if you want to sit, and of course, if you sat down, it is very unlikely you would view the stage since attendees on the pit are standing (and dancing and cheering).
I especially appreciate that upon entering the eatery/venue, that it smelled good- either food or 'sweet' like liqueur and not dirty or old.  A bonus is no smoking is permitted.  I do not drink either so I bring in my own water bottle.  I also appreciate that we're not being searched upon entry like the bigger venues- it's like visiting a club owned by a family or relative.  My paternal grandparents owned an Italian bar & restaurant, so it almost felt like the venue used to belong to them before they retired and sold to Crescent.  And, the fact that Crescent is located downtown and near the light rail stop is convenient for most.
I still return when I get invited, and I hope I continue getting A+ treatment each time (wink again).  Maybe I'll even sample the food.  Thanks for the good times Crescent and band members (thanks for enabling me to take great photos and also for the sample CD(French Girls)).  See you again soon.... Most of the time, this place rocks!  The happy hour specials work!  The Bahamarita is, by itself, a reason to come here.  One recommendation that is a have to if you like this place: sign up to get their emails.  Once or twice a year, they have free parties.  You can RSVP for up to five people.  They serve free food and drink.  The last one, they only gave you one free drink (in the past it was unlimited).  BUT I won a gift card to come back and dine.
For regular dinning, the coconut shrimp or the seafood paella.  Yum!. Awesome hole in the wall bar/restaurant in the South Side Works area. It's a nice change from all the other restaurant options in the area. Great food, and very friendly people working there. I always try to order something from their specials of the day and they are always great!. First time here, staff was very friendly! Love the reggae music in the background :) the breakfast burrito was delicious! Cute little cafe, will definitely be back soon. Let's be honest. Last Chance is not a place to take your date, your parents, or anyone else you're trying to show a good time. Yes, there are shoes and shirts strewn about - there are hundreds of pre-menopausal women clawing through the doors each day. No, the people there aren't always friendly - they're not trying to earn a tip from you...they're on a mission to clean up the 38,039 pairs of shoes and shirts left strewn about by said pre-menopausal women. Yes, there may be a line to the dressing room a dozen people long. Yes, there may be a checkout line 3 times longer than the dressing room line. *This isn't the place to linger with friends and admire the latest fashion - this is for die-hard bargain shoppers only.*

As far as the actual clothing goes, it's hit or miss. I've gone there many times without finding anything, but I've also left with $500 worth of clothing I paid less than $50 for. IMPORTANT: Carefully inspect everything before you buy it. Everything is sold as is, and there are no returns or exchanges - no exceptions.

Best advice? Get in, and get out. Best times are weekday mornings, though the last time I came I unexpectedly timed it just right when I thought it would be awful. I came in the early evening on a weekday, around 5:00. I had to wait over 10 minutes for a dressing room (it would have been much longer if I hadn't taken the open changing area), but once I was out there was no checkout line. The store was packed full of people, but it seemed that everyone had just arrived and wasn't ready to check out yet. If you can avoid it, DO NOT WAIT UNTIL LAST CHANCE CLOSES TO LEAVE. They will not let you keep looking around once 9pm hits, and you may have to wait in the checkout line for 30 minutes while the dozens of people in the store are pushed together all at once.

Know that everything is hit or miss at Last Chance. Some people are friendly and helpful, and some are not. Sometimes the lines are horrible, and sometimes they're quick. Sometimes you'll find incredible deals on beautiful clothing, and sometimes you won't.. Just off the main drag is this gem. We had the spiked lemonade and the half chicken bucket. The spiked lemonade is just like what the other reviews say, delicious. The fried chicken bucket came with 5 pieces of fried chicken,  corn bread, coleslaw and potato salad. Everything was amazing. The chicken, although harder than most fried chicken, was  double fried and had a great taste to it. We loved the flavour of the sauce they used over it. My personal preference would be that the batter wasn't as hard and crunchy but it was still so tasty that I wasn't bothered by it. The coleslaw and potato salad were top notch; both very tangy and flavorful. I'm not usually a cornbread liker but even this was good. Not as dry as most I've tried. The vibe was cool, hip, upbeat and different. The service was friendly and helpful. We had a really good time and would definitely go back.. The people at Discount Aquarium Fish and Reef were wonderful.  They were willing to help my class of 3rd grade students who were interested in learning about fish. I would definitely recommend them.. I totally understand this is a hate it or love it place. Well I love it! It's really small so no matter where you stand you have a good view. And the sound system is pretty good. Drinks are reasonably priced, and made really strong which is nice. Get some pre-show pizza it's really yummy for 3 bucks a slice!. Many gluten free options!

Have been here several times and have enjoyed each time.  Would have to agree with some of the other reviews that the gyro's are not the item to order.  The french fries are very good though.  The mixed grill is a great way to go.  You get 3 different meats, hummus, pita bread, a small salad, and rice.  Yes it sounds like a lot, but actually the portions are a bit small.  All items were very good and worth a repeat.

The restaurant can be very noisy at times making it hard to have a conversation with the person you came with, but they also have outside seating when the weather permits.  

Will definitely return and recommend to friends.  Love the open kitchen!. I just moved to Vegas with my 6 month old in June 2012 and am a stay at home mom. I never had anything like this back home in FL and found it to be a really great experience for my daughter who is very active and gets bored easily. We go twice a week to Music on Mondays with Ms Nicole who we love and Saturdays play and learn. Most of the staff is great, some are a bit literal when it comes to keeping the babies on their activity schedule. I do wish they would change up the classes a little bit more to keep the kids more interested. I also wish during their holiday parties they would offer 2 separate times for the 12-months and older group, instead of grouping them all together in the 0-16 months. When my daughter was learning to  walk I moved her up to the next level class and she was walking in 2 weeks!! My daughter has never gotten sick here. They keep the facility VERY clean. I do NOT think this place is over priced. I have a cousin who pays 25% more at her Gymboree in Chicago and they are more strict on make-up-days and class times. I pay $99 a month for both classes 2x a week which ends up being  $12 a class plus you get unlimited open gym. Highly recommended!!. Highly recommend trying this restaurant out! Me and my husband stopped by for our anniversary and couldn't have asked for anything better. Everything we tried was delicious, from the food to the drinks and the service was fantastic. Do yourself a favor and give this restaurant a try.. Delicious shrimp pud khana! Clean place, very friendly servers. Good portions. will definitely be back to try different dishes.. 5 stars for concept, atmosphere, vibe, and the layout of the place.
3 stars for the food and coffee.

A pinch of Starbucks, a bit of Einstein's, a dash of Dotty's, sprinkle in some Lodge-ness - mix it all together and you get this neat place.

I was pretty impressed with the layout of the Lodge CH&T - the outdoor covered patio is very nice, the inside is roomy with a living room set up on one side with free-standing video poker units (like Dotty's), a full service liquor bar, and of course the coffee counter with a pastry case.

The menu has alcohol, coffee, coffee with alcohol, paninis, salads, and breakfast items (well 2 but whatever) and a drive thru. Dining in? You order at the counter and they bring it to you.

My husband ordered the Cafe Lodge Panini & a hazelnut latte. I had the bacon, egg, & cheese sandwich with a white mocha (total 19 and change). The drinks were nothing spectacular -probably middle of the road average. The coffee prices are comparable to Starbucks (4.25 for a 16 oz white mocha). I was told the breakfast sandwich I ordered was new... it was okay - fast food-esque served on a plate. For 6.25, my husband considered his panini priced just right for the taste. Nothing we had was bad, it just wasn't great.

This would be a perfect place to meet friends in the morning for a latte on the patio or an adult beverage in the evening before a night out. It actually wouldn't be a bad place to hangout before or even after work. I was surprised there wasn't a TV behind the bar, it would be perfect to catch a game without the big crowd of a sports bar...
Note: they have ashtrays on every table and at the bar--- so it's smoker-friendly all over (this may bother some of you)

I'm definitely coming back to try out their adult coffee beverages....the chocolate martini sounded delicious.. I come here every so often whenever I need to pick up something that I can't quite get at the grocery stores closer to me. Because it's Vons, there are cheaper places I can go, but I really like picking up their soups and desserts.

I also enjoy that it is 24 hours because I tend to come to this Vons late at night. Even then, the desserts like the cake slices and cupcakes are still moist and delicious. Also the prices for the desserts are just in my range, especially the slices of cake, and the slices are a good size so I don't feel too bad buying one or two when I'm craving sweets.

The store tends to be clean and organized whenever I come here and the cashiers up front are friendly. Sometimes parking sucks, but that's because of people who like to park in two parking spaces, not because of Vons.. If you love wellness and yoga, you'll love TruFusion!  

After years of attending a wide variety of studios, 
here are the things I LOVE about TruFusion:

Environment - the space is warm, inviting, innovative and they have thought of every little detail to make your experience attending a class or workshop more relaxed and enjoyable.   From the reception to the locker rooms they have a great attention to detail.   The heating, technology and space flow are cutting edge.

People  - the instructors are excited to help EVERYONE!   Yes, everyone!  Whether you are new to yoga/pilates/kettlebells/TRX or any one of the other classes that support the wellness of your body, they are welcoming, supportive and encouraging!

Philosophy - wellness of body, mind and spirit are the principles they have incorporated into how they operate their business.  You might call it wellness of the space, the well thought out operations and ease of attending, and their friendliness and graciousness for all who step through their doors!

Oh... and they'll "bend over backwards" to make it a positive experience for you!. A group of 6 of us decided to try this for lunch today. The owner was enthusiastic and gave us a great run down of the menu and what everything was. I had the pollo sandwich with pulled chicken, mushrooms, potatoes, and onions on a focaccia type bread. The bread was delcious and the sandwich alone was enough to fill me up. Most of the other people in our group also got sandwiches and also said they were great along with the grilled corn. Someone got a salad and added shrimp to it. She said the shrimp and dressing were delicious. My only complaint/observation about this place is that there is very limited seating. There is almost no seating inside, so while it was great to eat on their patio during August, I'm not sure how much business they will do in the winter months. I think the food is great and the employees and service was exceptional, I just hope they can find a way to keep it running without seating in the winter.. Came here with two friends--it was my first time. I can understand why my friend asked to eat there for dinner. It was delicious. We got two rolls to share and they were both wonderful. I will definitely be going again!. Love the variety of food options! Sea food, pizza, salad bar, bakery, frozen yogurt and much more! It's reasonably priced and it's good quality food. It's nice to have a food court that actually has good food and a little for everyone. I've been coming to watch the Panther's here since the stadium opened. My dad is an original PSL holder so I've had the opportunity to go often. I love this place, it's kind of a happy place for me as I love football!! Anyways first of all it used to be a ridiculous walk to get to your seats and if you were in the top tier well bring an oxygen mask because by the time you hiked up there you were going to need it. Now however they've installed escalators and I had a chance to check them out last year. It makes a huge HUGE difference. The steps to the top are still super steep (scary) but doable. The lines here are fast moving, the food/beverage options are pretty good, and everything is clean etc. I've rarely had to wait for the bathroom and honestly it's just a good easy experience. There will be a lot of non-Panther's fans as this is a melting pot kind of town, however I have found it to be mostly good natured and peaceful!! GO PANTHERS!!!. I am in love with this food every time I see one I have to stop in and get the combination plate  .  The chicken is delicious there customer service is awesome always happy the place is always spotless. Surprisingly good burgers here.

I'd be weary of the mushroom flan, it looks and tastes a little like bacon grease.. I recently took the Banger Brewing tour!  What a treat!  These guys know what they are doing with beer!  What is most impressive is their list of beers breaking down the "hoppiness" of each brew.  If you try a flight - you can give them an idea of what you like and they will bring you a little bit of beer heaven!  I'm really hoping they add food or offer to have food delivered??  And do so well they extend their hours.  Welcome to the neighborhood Banger Brewing!!  I'm so glad you're here!. Overall experience was good. Really enjoyed the atmosphere, we had seats right next to the canal. Service was timely and the food was pretty good. Really enjoyed the pineapple margarita that was recommended by server.. Hands down this is the BEST food. Everything was cooked perfectly, and their sauces are to die for. Portions are big and they don't skimp on any meat in their dishes. Their appetizers are amazing. And when we ordered a big takeout order they offered a free two-liter of soda. Definitely going back on a regular basis.. I love the choice selections on dim sum here, as well as the freshness of the food. Dim sum runs from 10:30 am- 4:30 pm. I love the fact that this place doesn't get heavy traffic on most days. Other dim sum places I've been too takes time, and is always busy with people. I mean I guess that's the vibe that any dim sum place should have. 

Pork buns are amazing! Shu mai, har gow, shrimp rice roll, and egg custard are good as well. Big portions for dim sum, and the shrimp with the honey mayo sauce is awesome! For two big plates listed in Group A, and a few Group Bs and Cs, we managed to burn a $42 hole in our pocket for TWO. But, that's us though, being the vultures that we truly are. I'd assume average tab for two would run about $30. Also, if you ay cash you get a 5% discount. 

Only thing I wonder is if the interior is having a midlife crisis. So it seems it was going for a more westernized and modern look, with touch of traditional Asian flavor. But! as long as the place is clean, then it's all good with me!!! :). I have found many great deals here on everything from sweatshirts to blouses to accessories. I highly recommend you check out their accessories. They have metal, wood, headbands - all great statement pieces for next to nothing. If you're in the market for a new outfit or just want to do some shopping without breaking the bank, head into Name Brand Exchange.. This is our go-to pizza takeout.  The wings are nicely sized and always loaded with sauce.  The pizza is always tasty with a crispy crust.  Giant pizza and loads of wings at a great price.. I was very impressed with the service I received last night at this Outback. I have many food allergies and am always hesitant to go out to eat. I explained to my server that I had food allergies and asked if they could accomodate, she understood completely saying that she herself has many food allergies too. She brought me a Gluten-Free menu and I made my adjustments from that.

After placing my order the manager came out to ask more specifically how I wanted my food cooked wether it should be cooked on its own, what spices were acceptable and she also offered different options for sauces to which I was able to choose from.

My food was perfect, I can't complain about anything, they went above and beyond my request and I am so grateful. I never felt like my many requests and substitutions were a burden. I highly recommend the Outback at Southern and McClintock if you have food allergies.. Ballast point on tap. Great food and knowleable servers.. This nightclub seems a bit small, but worth the time spent. Take the elevator up to the rooftop and are kindly directed to the proper direction. Voodoo has a indoor and outdoor portion along with a bar inside and outside.

I like this club because its different and you have a chance to dance your night away to a spectacular view of different color lights and Vegas. Sort of a romantic spot while dancing away. Don't forget to get the witches brew at the main bar! Worth the bucks!. Where to start with Gilley's??  The girls in their cute little cowboy hats and tiny bikinis drew me in but the food kept us there and left us satisfied. There are posters all over TI advertising the place, with the girls in their (tiny) black bikinis front and center. My husband and I were looking for a bit to eat on our last night in town and got tired of walking around so we settled on Gilley's. I am an avid country music (and western wear) fan, so I felt right at home. You walk through the bar and dance hall section to the restaurant in the back, which has a completely different feel than the front of the establishment. I immediately regretted our choice when I realized Yelp's average was an unimpressive 2.5 stars, but since we were hungry we decided to stay anyway. And boy, am I glad we did!!

 My husband had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of the two-cheese mac & cheese, and I had the Gilley's chili with a side of mac & cheese. The chili wasn't at all anything to write home about - a little too thin and runny and the texture of the beef reminded me of Taco Bell. However, the chili came with jalapeno corn muffins which were AWESOME... cakey and dense but not dry with the perfect amount of jalapeno flavor. I ordered two more on the side for $1. My husband made a complete mess of himself eating the pulled pork sandwich, declaring with confidence that it was easily the best one he had ever had. While I make dramatic declarations like this all the time, he does not, so this is quite an impressive comment coming from him. The mac & cheese was excellent, and service was very friendly and prompt. Lona, our waitress, took care of all our requests very quickly. I did leave with an empty plastic boot, which you can get filled with a margarita for $17. Since I wasn't up to being three sheets to the wind 16 hours before needing to board a plane, I opted to take it home empty. It was cheaper than the cowboy boots I had been ogling at Boot Star in Fashion Show the day before! For the first out of two times on our trip, I was glad I didn't heed Yelp's advice and miss out on this one (the second location I almost passed up was Sammy's Beach Bar & Grill at McCarren Airport - see review). We've been here several times and have never paid a cover. They use to open at 6pm and cover started at 7 on weekends, they now open at 7. I prefer the 6pm open time and they are missing out on valuable happy hour opportunities in my opinion. If you make a reservation for 2 or more they waive the cover, not sure how long that will be. Honestly, a cover is unnecessary for this place, if it's to pay the musicians, they seem to be doing just fine, every time we've been there, they are tipped heavily. I've never had bad service here, everyone from the door, the guy going around picking up empty glasses, people bringing the food, wait staff to the bar have been outgoing. Saturday was slammed, standing room only around 9 so the wait staff was busy but, I always had eyes on her and was able to grab her or motion when I needed a refill. We like sitting in the bar area, it's not as loud and if the wait staff is busy-turn around and go order directly from the bar. The manager even bought one beer for us posting a photo of the Big Ass beer cup on Facebook. 
We ordered the Quesadilla & a Veggie burger from the kitchen and nothing was left on our plate they were so good. This and 4 drinks ran around $47. The mixed drinks have always been poured like I make at home, never a disappointment there.
Some musicians are better than others, they all are good with working with the crowd. Starting with warm up slowly working the crowd into joining in and getting dirtier with the lyrics as the night progresses. Don't be bummed if they don't play your requested song, there are some that for artist copyright reasons, they aren't allowed to play. If you don't like simulated sex acts on stage or vulgarity this is not for you. Really, I think most people that go here are going just for that! There were at least 5 people celebrating their birthday this night and they were treated to all kinds of shenanigans on stage, fun to watch! Come with an open attitude & tip money and you'll have a good time.. Before getting my first tattoo I checked out many shops before getting a recommendation to check out high noon. The atmosphere of the shops I had previously visited don't even compare. The staff are professional,  accommodating, and friendly and the place is clean and comfortable. I got my first tattoo here about five years ago and they have nearly tripled in size since then, which clearly speaks for itself. I've had work done by Mikey, Jeff, Manny, and Luke and all of them are awesome. Don't be detoured if the artists listed above have a significant wait time, the wait is well worth it for the quality of work and service you'll receive. Hands down most awesome shop I've had the pleasure of being in.. This is such an ethical and truly genuine rescue. They go above and beyond for their animals and it really shows. All they want is to give their dogs a wonderful forever home and they do everything in their power to ensure that. 

Karen, the owner, is very responsive, thorough and helpful. She has devoted herself to these animals, which is amazing in and of itself. I worked with Karen as a foster mom for a beautifully wonderful dog. She coached me through the process, helped me get the medical attention the dog needed and gave me so much advice. 

This rescue is filled with genuine people who go above and beyond. There aren't enough kind things I can say about them. 2 Da Rescue all the way!!. Great show.  Started out as a one man show in downtown Manhattan and has expanded to this Vegas extravaganza.   Loads of fun for every age, language, gender.  Must see!!!. I've been coming here since it first opened and I'm glad to see business is still going strong.

The best part for me is the space.  Each different room has a sort of "tea theme"  There's the Japanese room, the Moroccan room etc. etc.

The owner is extremely knowledgable and passionate about his tea.  He is a very kind and caring guy he just doesn't put it on display in a bubbly sort of way.

Great little tea cookies--my favorite are the basil lemon kind--they have real chunks of herb baked into them.  

I've yet to have a disappointing tea.  Last time I was in there I asked for a recommendation for a black tea and what I got was fantastic!  It was malty almost like a beer or miso soup.  So unique and delicious.

Things they used to have and I'm sad to see went away:

-pillows in the japanese tea space  --they made it so comfy that I'm sure people (me) wanted to stay all day.

-stamp cards for frequent customers. My friend and I were only here for the drinks. Havent eaten here yet. Met the owner who was bartending and he was a total sweetheart. This place is newely opened and is definetly in need of more servers. Seems as though the food is good but the service, not so hot. Definetly need to hire some more servers. Im giving 4 stars because the drinks were great and my overall service at the bar was good and I enjoyed the atmosphere. I think this place just needs some time to get in the groove and on its feet. Definetly plan to visit again soon and try the food and see if service has improved.. Happy hour! Pineapple cheese wontons, viva vegas roll, yellowtail nigiri and rainbow roll! Good food, good price!. Delicious food!  Anything can be made vegetarian!!  Friendly staff!  Local business!!. Cheba hut is awesome! Salads, toasted subs, and other munchies to top it off. Casual and clean.. My husband and i have been living in las vegas for two years and havent seen any vegas shows! I was browsing through MYVEGAS rewards and found a ticket to t o k s for like 28000 points, which i had, so i said to myself what the heck! And since u can use up to 3 rewards in a month span we also took advantage of a 25 dollar night stay at excaliber as well. We arrived about 30 early which was perfect they had just started letting people in. We found our seats easy enough and we picked norway for heritage purposes but i recommend sitting in dragon or russia they are right in the middle. Our section seemed to have a very long wait for everything... drinks, food an  dessert. Our dinner was ok the best part was the cornish game hen and broccoli with parmesan. It also came with two baby reds and a soggy biscut. An  our dessert was basically a toaster strudel. But the entertainment was so fun and our king was cute an  charming. I would go again with any out of towners visiting!. Recently moved into Palacio Apartments after selling my Condo and so far am very happy with my decision. 
The price for the size of the unit and the amenities of the complex make it worth it for me. Besides that the leasing staff is WONDERFUL. 
I have never met a group of ladies so helpful. I was more than a little spazzed when it came to moving and looked at many many MANY apartments and Palacios staff is by far the best in the valley. 
They also paint for a fee which for me makes my apartment experience feel more homey.So far i'm glad with my decision!!. I absolutely love this place.  The food is amazing and best yet it's organic and they cater to vegans too!. What an absolutely fun place with great food. Nothing like it in Vegas really. We had the chili cheese dog and the hot dog plus beef sandwich meals. They tasted perfect!  I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves this type of food. Worth the drive, although I wish I lived a little closer.. Awesome pho and super busy restaurant!  It's so hard to find good pho anywhere, and this place is amazing.  The soup was minty, the meat was excellent, and the noodles were perfectly cooked.  We also got the bun cha gio thit nuong, and the meat was a bit dry but overall, the dish was pretty good.  I would only get pho the next time I come, as this place left me gave me a great impression.  The service is pretty fast and friendly, so we'll be coming back here during our next Vegas trip! :). This is my favorite place in Las Vegas right now. It has some of the best and most fresh tasting food as well as an extremely welcoming and accommodating staff. I have had a positive experience EVERY time I have eaten there
I have even tried their lunch buffet. I was a bit apprehensive about a buffet but, Mint did not disappoint. It was such a lovely collection of foods and I was totally satisfied. 
I am getting hungry just thinking about how great everything is at Mint!. Ended up here after seeing a show and had a great time! Didn't get bottle service or Hooka, but were still easily able to dance on the patio with awesome dj...all hip hop, just what we wanted. $10 cover, very nice door man, no line. Wonderful to get into the open air to dance and away from smokey casino, and true its pretty thick with cigar smoke inside. Nice bartenders, normal prices for Vegas. Highly recommend!. Hier gibt es volle Punktzahl- mit einem Geheim-Tipp aus dem Freundeskreis habe ich in Judys Café meinen Geburtstag mit 25 Personen gefeiert: über dem schön eingerichteten Café ist ein großer, heller Raum mit einer gemütlichen Sofa-Ecke und weiteren Sitzgelegenheiten. Von der persönlichen Abstimmung (Essen und Getränke, Ablauf und Anzahl der Gäste) mit Judy bis zum Ende dieser Feier war alles perfekt. Sehr lecker gegessen (Putengeschnetzeltes und das vegetarische Thai Curry sind zu empfehlen). Der Service mit einer immer freundlichen und zuvorkommenden Bedienung- es waren alle Gäste sehr zufrieden. An dieser Stelle kann ich mich dem Lob meiner Gäste nur anschließen und herzlich DANKE sagen!. Brandon was a perfect server, he was quick and attentive. The food is wonderful! Cheese dip portion was huge and black bean dip was same size. Plenty of food - large portions. Great drinks. There is a TWO TOP TABLE THAT HAS A OUTLET TO CHARGE YOUR PHONE. It's right around the corner on the wall. I love to be able to charge my phone while dining! Superb service!!. wow! this place is freaking huge!! saturday night and the long is ridiculously long! but we were sooOoo damn fortunate to bump into our old middle school friends in front of the line and they let us cut!! (and the bouncer was okay with it.. kekeke)  cover is $20/girls $30/guys... i didn't wanna pay cover but what the hell i wanted to check the place out..

i like the whole outdoor thing with the pool. but i guess it wouldn't be too nice during the winter.. haha.. one thing that i love love love about it being part outdoors is that you dont suffocate with all the cigarette smoke (like tao) AND there were plenty of places to sit and rest your feet.. dipping your feet in the pool also helps. 

theres tables in the center to gamble.. which i thought was kind of weird.. who wants to pay cover to go gamble at $50 minimum tables? ehh.. i guess its for the guys who got dragged to go clubbing lol

the only downside is that the bar gets wayyyyyyyyyy crowded. Great atmosphere, excellent massage (55min) and customer service. Everyone I came in contact with was very helpful and nice. Only thing I would change, wish I did the 80min!. Not bad. Had a pepperoni pizza with anchovies and bell pepper. It was hot and the crust was nice. Delivery was as promised. It was a little pricey and the guy in the phone was hard to understand but I would order it again. Taste trumps convenience every time!. I'm liking this place right now.  Been there about 3 times in the last month.  It's much busier when football is on as Old Town is starving for more places to watch the games.  They have a bloody mary special on Saturdays (maybe Sundays too?) that has a mini grilled cheese on top...seriously....grilled cheese..that's amazing.  
The melts are good, the variety and changing beers on top make it fun and interesting each time you come in.  

Servers are non memorable so far, but the greeter is super friendly and makes you feel welcome.  

They need to add more appetizer options to the menu.  When groups are drinking and snacking, they would sell more apps with more options.. We've been wanting to stop by Umami and try their gourmet burgers in SoCal, so when I saw the Umami Burger Bar at the SLS, I had to give it a try!  The Ahi Tuna burger was so delicious, I brought my hubby the NEXT day before we drove back to CA.

The second lunch was even better than the first! Since we don't eat beef anymore, we split a "Greenbird" (turkey) burger and an Ahi Burger (seared with fresh ginger & wasabi sauce) and both were outstanding. The sweet potato fries were good, although they were more than we could eat.

Mandy was our server and she was great !!   Not only was she super friendly and attentive, she genuinely made sure everything was to our liking and the food was cooked to perfection. She even put our tea's in "to go" containers for our trip home. 

Excellent service and innovative, tasty burgers,..especially for a chain restaurant in Vegas. Umami is definitely worth trying, and we'll be back.. Besides the typical Vietnamese talk the salon does really good work. I pick my feet really bad and they always repair it without any pain. Also the lady is very nice at going beyond and putting cute designs on my toes. Also her waxing eyebrows are amazing!!! ^_^. This Harris Teeter is tiny and not the best as far as prices and selection, but they have by far the best deli of any of the Harris Teeters I've been to in the area.  I'd eat a Harris Teeter sub over Subway any day of the week, and especially from this location.  Instead of squirting mayo and mustard from a bottle, one on each side, they lather it on with a knife, creating this unbelievably magical sauce that I would eat on their fresh white bread alone.  Add to it great cuts of meat and fresh veggies, and you have sandwich perfection.  However, don't come here if you're looking for a deal because its one of the more overpriced Teet's I've visited. (Which is why it lost one crucial star from me.)   But if you're in uptown and craving a good sub, this is the place to go!  Not to mention it's in fourth ward, one of the most beautiful areas of Charlotte.. Authentic!!!! Its the real deal! The chips and salsa...ORDER IT - a MUST HAVE! The only thing I wished for was a Corona beer to drink with it...but I was happy with the fresh cold jamaica.Great flavor...great service... VERY good local food...not fancy..but definitely worth the stop! The breakfast burritos are great as were the carnitas...! Will definitely be back!. I only wish we had found this place sooner!  My husband and I moved here from Michigan 5 years ago, the Middle Eastern food in MI can't be beat!  One of the things I missed the most was chicken shawarma sandwiches.  I spent almost 4 years searching for a good Middle Eastern restaurant but it seemed every restaurant I found around the Phoenix area was Persian style which I personally don't like.  

One day a friend recommended Al-Hana inside the Baiz Market.  My husband and I decided to give it a try and we were blown away!  This is how chicken shawarma should taste, and the garlic sauce is perfection.   The meat, cheese and spinach pies they sell are also incredibly good.  I think you can get a dozen for $9 or $10 dollars.  We usually buy a dozen to take home and eat them for breakfast over the next few days.  

The best part is they're located inside a Middle Eastern market so you can buy specialty items for a really great price while you're waiting for your food!  You can buy jars of tahini for less than half the price you would pay in a normal grocery store, and get specialty spices like Sumac for a very cheap price ($1.99.)

I also have to add that both of the girls that are usually behind the register are very sweet and always strike up a conversation with me, and if I ever order anything special the cook always double checks with me before making my order.. This review is a bit delayed so I apologize!!!! Here goes:

To start our cross country trip from California to South Carolina, my husband and I wanted to start our trip in style and not only celebrate our big 3000+ mile journey but also my husbands 50th B-day so, I booked our 2 night stay at the Four seasons. When I made the reservations, I mentioned that this was a celebration and the representative told me she would make sure and have a little surprise awaiting my hubby upon arrival.

Being an experienced Las Vegas traveler, but never staying at the Four seasons I was very excited and hoping not to be disappointed. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the valet who sweeped us away, took our bags, gave us water and showed us to our NO LINE waiting check-in area. The entrance of this hotel is beautiful, clean and classy. Check-in was a breeze. When arriving at our room, which was a suite, let me just say this was the most amazing, beautiful room I have ever seen let alone stayed in, in Las Vegas. The furnishings, the fabrics, the colors, amenities, bathroom toiletries, etc etc amazing. There is nothing left untouched in luxury here. There was even a K-cup machine in our room with free k-cups daily...seriously? LOVE IT! so, our little suprise arrived shortly after check-in and it was a beautiful plate adorned with a luscious slice of cake that looked too pretty to eat. Also, for "liking" their Facebook page, I also received another chocolate treat. The desserts were delish and well presented.

The room easily accomodated visiting with my family who lives in LV in the living room area as it had a lovely couch, 2 chairs, a large TV and a view to make most people swoon. This room BTW was the 1 bedroom suite, sorry don't remember exactly the name but I think that was it.

We enjoyed Charlie Palmers one evening and followed our meal with the Michael Jackson Cirque show...AMAZING. Everything was simply top notch. The cafe for breakfast was great. The coffee was some of the best I have ever enjoyed and the service equally impressive. Also enjoyed a drink at the bar one evening which was during happy hour and it was handcrafted nicely and reasonably priced. 

The pool is cozy, private and well maintained. I didn't see any of the treats being circulated that they advertise such as fruit etc, but they do offer chilled water at your lounge area and the attendants are quick to get your towels and daybeds ready for you to be as lazy as you like.

Check-out was smooth, quick and painless.........I wish I could say the same for our remainder of hotels along our 2500+ miles from there ...LOL. Excellent small dishes with nice level of spice. I've been here several times and have been pleased each time. We had a vegan and a meat connoisseur in our party. This pleased both.. Wonderful food with fantastic service! I loved the frozen custard and the burger was great too. 
Only cons= no trash cans, as this is a place where the staff takes care of you and clears the tables for you after eating. This is only a problem if you don't know this and walk from corner to corner in the restaurant looking for a trash can. Also, sometimes this place can be a ZOO with unruly children running amok, this is not the restaurant's fault just the rude parents who visit with their undisciplined children.. Good chain restaurant, salad was good proportions with meat added (Two dollars add on). Grilled Chicken burgers are good but a little watery, fried chicken is crispy. Smash fries are good with anything. Black bean burger is good but very soft and not really burger texture.

This location is attentive, friendly and new people tend to work with managers.. Based on breakfast/brunch:

WHY DID IT TAKE ME SO LONG TO EAT HERE?!

When it comes to buffets, it's mostly misses to me. Other than the Wynn buffet, no other buffet has made me take more than 2 trips (2 plates) for food. But this evil little place had me up and about 4 friggin times! Now granted I didn't eat everything that I took back to my table. I just mainly sampled and put it aside if it wasn't to my liking. Once again, if you have a problem with that, read my review for the Wynn Buffet and then you can shut up about it. 

Anyways... they don't have a huge selection of food, but the food they do offer is scrumptious and the presentation is seriously unrivaled. Foods have their own little container/pot/serving. I'm assuming for aesthetics, but it's also great for me cause there's some kind of portion control. Instead of grabbing two ladles of mac&cheese, you just grab a mini sized pot of it. Very smart, Wicked Spoon. Very smart. 

My favorite part was their Nutella gelato. If you follow my reviews, y'already know how much I cry for Nutella. So please believe I had two cups of that chocolatey nutty goodness. *drool*

It's weirdly decorated. Well it's supposed to look "wicked." They definitely accomplished that. Everything was set off with an orange backdrop of light. Tis a plus in my books seeing how I'm from the bay and my boys, SF GIANTS, just won the WS so bonus mothaeffin points. 

Ps. I believe you are entitled to a free mimosa. Free drank? Yes, please. 

TIP: If buffet's aren't really your thing, they do have a to-go option here. I believe it's about $16 and they give you a fatty ass container and a free bottled water, you stuff as much food as you can in the box, and go on your merry way. I haven't done it myself, but my friends have and they seemed quite pleased (and full). 

I will most definitely come back for lunch or dinner. Can't wait to get fat.. FABULOUS hotel.  The hotel is modern and well-decorated, without being gimmicky.  My friend and I stayed in a standard room, but it was by far the coolest room I've ever stayed in.  A lot of space, modern technology, lovely decor.  Only thing that's lacking is a coffee machine.

Everyone at the hotel was very attentive and friendly.  At the identity counter, the woman working there apologized profusely for letting me stand there for a minute.  No big deal, but it was nice that she cared.

The food selection is obviously one of the best of the Las Vegas Hotels.  You really don't even have to leave the hotel if you don't want to, they have everything-shopping, dining, pool, etc. 

I will definitely stay here when I'm back in Vegas!. I've been looking for a Thai place here and I think I've found the one! I tried a few dishes and they were all stellar. The chicken panang, the lamb panang, the pad see ew with shrimp and the Thai fried rice with shrimp were all great! This is definitely my new favorite Thai restaurant!. I like Ichiza.  It's a cute place to eat.  I went there after work with a friend.  We ordered salmon skin salad, wasabi octopus, Red Snapper Carpacci, chicken gizzard skewer, and beef tongue skewer.  The wasabi octopus is raw and it gets worse tasting after a while.  I loved the beef tongue skewer.  It was warm and the outside was a bit crunchy. We also ordered the honey toast.  There was nothing special about the honey toast.  It was normal.  The honey was sweeter than normal, though.. The food is great but be prepared to wait for drinks and food to come out. Everything we ordered was fantastic! Bone marrow and box tail are great if you're a fan of that type of thing. Muscles, tuna, and drinks were all fabulous. The only issue: SERVICE IS SLOW!!! Super slow. There were not many people in the restaurant when we went and it still took ages to get out drinks. If you're in a rush for a show, this is not your spot. If you have the time, go to the patio, it has a great view.. Amazing! I am new to the area so I wanted to try something new. I was greeted and asked what I would like to eat. I told the cashier that it was my first time there. I wanted to try the tenders. He explained that their chicken is fresh and never frozen, and all tenders were hand breaded to order. I ordered 3 tenders and chose Garlic Parmesan sauce. I also chose fries as he said they were hand cut. He threw in one of their fresh breadsticks for me to try. I chose their homemade ranch dressing. When my food came it was piping hot, fresh,  and the chicken was spot on - tender, juicy, and well seasoned. This is definitely my new favorite place for fresh chicken tenders!!!!. Ah the i-pod and the MP3 player!  You can take hundreds of songs with you everywhere!  And they're so convenient too!  Never again will you be bored by the drudgery of

--Listening to a WHOLE album's worth of music.
--Having to go to a record store alone or with your friends.
--Discovering an artist you never heard of.
--Being overjoyed at finding that old, rare, obscure album or hard-to-find import.
--Having something you can call yours and actually hold in your hands.
--Building up a music collection that you can proudly display.
--Finding out about an in-store performance or autograph signing.

Me, I'll take the inconvenience any day.  I guess I'm old school and proud of it.  I was here this past weekend and found a copy of Poi Dog Pondering's "Pomegranate".. Love this store, love the people who work there.  Always so pleasant and helpful.  I work nearby, and they always seem to have what I need.. Pizza crust was a little too thick for me, but there poutine and suicide fries are killer and garlic knots are to die for. FYI they don't have booster or high chairs for kids so come prepared for that. Overall it was good good and nice atmosphere.. I'm actually really keen for the banter in here, so I'm not sure why I don't come here more often. I think it's because we're all a bit too set in our traditional ways down in the new town, so it's about time I coerced my friends into coming up here more often.

Assembly is quite student orientated, given the location near Edinburgh University, but if you class yourself as young then this is a pretty snazz place to have a few drinks. This is a really good looking place to sit and have a drink, I've always been keen on the modern, slightly edgy look to it, and the cocktails are really good, and so reasonable in comparison to the skyscraping prices in the new town. Certainly a cool place to have imbibe some beverages, I recommend.. If you haven't been to the Biscuit yet, you have done yourself a great disservice. I have been here about a hundred times and have had just about everything on the menu and I never had a bad meal here. The steak and eggs are nothing short of phenomenal and the biscuits are out of this world. Run, don't walk to the Biscuit for breakfast. Make sure to get there early, or you'll find yourself waiting in a long line!  This place lives up to the hype.. Excellent Korean food- I recommend the Bulgogi. I would like to personally commend Fox Chapel Family Dental for their excellent response and attention to treating my son.  My son, who is away at college, called early on a Saturday morning and told us that both of his front teeth were severely damaged, and as you can imagine my husband and I were extremely distraught.  We knew he must see a dentist as soon as possible, but were unsure how that was going to happen on a Saturday.  Thankfully, one of the nurses at UPMC gave him Fox Chapel's number and Dr. Marc Johnson called him back immediately to schedule an appointment for that day.
We sincerely appreciate the immediate response and dedication to treat our son off hours. Dr. Johnson went above and beyond and it is an indication of his professionalism.
We never would have thought that by the end of the day he would have temporary teeth in place. He currently has an appointment scheduled for the permanent crown repair.
Once again, we are really appreciative of Dr Marc Johnson's and Fox Chapel's commitment to their practice.. I love my lashes..I had Kim and also Crystal do them..they are full and long. The atmosphere is so relaxing you can't help but cozy up and take a nap. I have had extensions from other places doesn't compare to what I get here.. First off, let's get the obvious out of the way- Okada is expensive, quite expensive. If you can get over that little detail, then Okada is excellent! 

My boyfriend and I went here for dinner for an amazing teppanyaki meal. The restaurant itself is beautiful; I'm in love with the entrance, as well as the water oasis outside. The teppanyaki area is beautiful as well- simple, nicely lit, very clean, and a great view of the garden/waterfall. 

We were seated at a Teppan grill where three gentlemen (businessmen to be exact) were already sitting. On a completely unrelated note, one of the first things I noticed was the giant stick, actually, block of butter laying next to the grill. Anyways, to start with, we ordered a bottle of cold sake. I don't remember which one, but my boyfriend mentioned its ridiculous markup rate (Something along the lines of a $50 bottle of sake priced at $125). Anyways, I thought the pitcher they poured the sake into to keep it cold was lovely, and I noticed that the sake glasses had the signature Wynn logo imprints (Steve Wynn really likes his last name...).

We ordered from the Teppanyaki menu, which comes w/ 

Mizuna & edamame tofu green salad- delicious, I especially enjoyed the fried sweet potato chip on top and the fresh green tofu. Perfect, refreshing way to start the meal. 

Miso soup- No complaints

Your choice of Oshinko & Jidori egg pilaf (or Wasabi ochazuke for $10 extra) or Steamed rice (or Fried rice- shrimp, chicken or beef for $10 extra). 

Wasabi Ochazuke- a baked rice ball immersed in a savory broth made from tea and topped w/ an assortment of items. A simple dish packed w/ flavor and quite refreshing to eat before the main course. I enjoyed the side of Tsukemono and Umeboshi (Japanese pickles) that came w/ the dish. 

After looking over the menu some more, I chose the Maine Lobster for my entree, and my boyfriend chose the Colorado Lamb Loin rubbed in Japanese pepper and a side order of American Kobe Beef Tenderloin. 

Showtime! Our Teppan chef arrived w/ meats & an assortment of vegetables in tow. I was feeling friendly, so we started chatting. Our Teppan chef moved to Vegas from Hawaii, and has been working at Okada since it opened (I knew from that little fact that the food would be good). His favorite place to eat in Vegas is Ichiza, he isn't on Yelp...Okay, I think that's enough chef background for now...

The chef gave us three sauce options for our entrees: Teriyaki, Wasabi cream & a sauce for seafood. 

We started w/ Rock Shrimps & Japanese Mushrooms w/ Sudachi Sauce, which was great. 

Shrimp Fried Rice- buttery, flavorful & so good. I loved how the fried rice had little nuggets of Japanese pickles in it, which actually worked, contrary to my thoughts before tasting the rice. 

Lobster- fresh from the tank, the lobster was so sweet & tender. Nothing more to say about this entree.

Lamb- tender and perfectly-cooked

Tenderloin- so tender and flavorful

By this point, we were stuffed, but we saved room for dessert (part of the Teppan course), which was a parfait of sorts made from chunks of mango & vanilla bean cream studded w/ tapioca pearls. A nice, light way to end the meal. 

Service was great, the food was delicious & the atmosphere was perfect. Overall, a memorable experience. I would come back to Okada if I get the chance.. I will totally be back!!

The service was great! They were pretty busy for lunch and our server was very attentive. 
 

The food was great and so were the prices. I wasnt sure if it was family owned, but I totally got that feel.. One of the best Thai restaurants ever!!!! I really really really enjoy the Padang, crab fried rice, pork jerky, pad se ew, tom yum. So far that's all I ever order. You see when I first went there I only ordered the panang, and every time I go I would try something different well I started to realize that all that food was too much for one person. I cant just order one thing I have to order all of it :( so I'm afraid if I order something else I'll just add that to my list. Every taste is yummy I can't even express it. Just try it. The servers are super nice!!!! The only time one of them made me feel awkward was when I went to pick up dinner and the cashier said " Hey, it's you again!!! I thought you may have forgotten something earlier today from lunch" :( lol.. Finally writing a review after my third visit!  Twice for lunch and once for dinner. AWSOME food and love the patio. Rachele was our waitress and she honestly was probably the BEST server we have had!  Great personality and amazing service. Food is so fresh and drinks are great too. Can't wait to go back!!!!!. Been to the Egg countless times.  It is consistently good. I must add that my review is based solely on breakfast food as i've never ventured to the lunch side of the menu. I love those protein pancakes and have yet to meet a person who didn't thoroughly enjoy them. Since i am a fan of savory foods at breakfast, lately i get the Half & Half. This way i get 2 good-sized protein pancakes and half of a scramble. The sausage & bacon scramble is good as well as the chicken & avocado scramble. Their breakfast potatoes are yummy, i like mine with syrup! Its great hangover food and you can usually get a table within about 10 minutes. The service is consistently good here and food is out so quick, which is prob why the wait times are low. It does get busy on wknds after 10am, so be prepared for crowds waiting.. Ok so we went to Vegas for a 3day weekend in Aug of last year (2012). Well this was my experience once we got in about to head in the check in line we were bombarded by a film crew asking for us to star in a short scene, I was eager to check in since it was a long hot drive, so I said "No" but my friend said yes I'll do it so that held us back a good 20 min. We got in line checked in with no problems but when we got to our room our bathroom door was broken, it off the hinges, as one of our divas called front desk to let them know what was going on they had asked "are you sure it's broken". As much as we are comfortable with each other I think we like our bathroom moments private :p. sooo as soon as my little diva got us another room, it was smooth sailing from there. The man made beach is freaking awesome loved it, and the lazy river need I say more just sit back and let it float you away!! We did have a awesome trip and a awesome stay. Hoping to do Vegas trips yearly!! :). Working just a few doors down I was excited to see a drive thru high quality coffee shop coming in!  I've been twice so far, and love it!  If you pull to the drive thru and there's someone at the window, a very friendly staff member will walk out to your car window and greet you, take your order, and it it started inside!  The first time I had the iced Jamaican coffee with a shot added to it (a staff recommendation) and it was fantastic,,,slight hint of maple sweetness!  Today I had an iced hazelnut latte, again delish!  Friendly customer service, great quality, a drive thru for chilly winter days...I'm sold!  Look for it in the building shared with Forward Dental just before Whitney Way!. This place is amazing!!!! They are so friendly!!  We chat every time i come in!! Very clean and they do such a great job! I'm there right now getting my nails done for my wedding. If you don't like something (which never happens) they will fix it to make it how you like. I wouldn't go anywhere else. By the way..they always keep homemade cookies which are delicious.. The diner's decor is truly it's claim to fame, but the food is pretty good. I ordered the Meat Lover's Omelette--3 eggs with diced ham, sausage, bacon, and Jack cheese. I had the red potatoes and an English Muffin on the side.The yummy meat-stuffed omelette was "bear" sized and I couldn't finish it. The potatoes were a bit dry, so I moved on to the English Muffin. My hubby seemed to enjoy his Club Sandwich and we were totally full by the time we were finished. Really no room for dessert.....but who could resist trying the Strawbeary(uh-huh) Cream Pie? It was to die for! The diner gets pretty crowded on weekends with a wait time of 5-20 minutes. But you can spend that time looking at all the bears!. My husband met Tonapah Rob at the central phx famer's market back a year or 2 ago and we have been out to his farm.  He has wonderful veggies!  He will ship to you also.  Check him out:-). Celebrated a birthday- the outside was full on the only dry night in Pittsburgh so we opted to sit inside- good move! 
Not only was the staff (ask for Mark) and service fantastic but the food was flavorful and spot on.  We were able to watch every preparation and catered to by the chefs themselves!!!!  What a special night!
Recommended starters:
Angry snapper- spicy tuna, snapper?tempura, cucumber and jalapeño
Barely fried shrimp
Peppered tuna

Small plates:
Dumplings!
Tempura shrimp
Shishito- Brussels sprouts

Sablefish!!!!!!!!****** fantastic!!!!!

Bowls:
Drunken noodle!
Pan pho- can make as hot as you would like


Dessert: avocado creme brûlée- light slightly sweet and maybe healthy

We will definitely be back to try more options but were very happy with tonight. Love The Living Room! Two visits so far and we were not disappointed. Great vibe/decor, food, drinks, and service on both occasions. The staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome. The music was also fantastic. The patio is large and inviting. Our out of town guest, who is a well traveled foodie, can't wait to return! Note that this is a wine bar/cafe and the menu reflects this as it is geared towards apps/finger food with a bit of a twist/drinks. We love the overall ambiance and will be back!. Clean restaurant!
My boyfriend and I came in to eat around 1:00am on Thursday morning.
One waitress working-holding it down.
Doing a great job but didn't say her name or have a name tag.
I ordered 2 eggs, hashbrowns, sausage, biscuit & gravy AND chocolate Oreo pancakes.
 Everything was scrumptious but my eyes were bigger than my stomach. 
Big portions! Perfect for family size or take home.
This was my first time. 
I usually go to IHOP but I will be returning soon.
(My boyfriend left satisfied as well). This place was GREAT!  So much to do, we couldn't get it all done in the time we got there.  We should have gotten there when it opened.  The kids didn't want to leave and we didn't even do the Planatarium.  They had games that could be played, a bed of nails you could lay on, a section on the human body with a ton of things to do, a water, ball and tubes in an outdoor section.  It was worth the money.  My kids are 11, 10, 9, 8, and 6.. The buffalo chicken wings are tremendous.
the crab ragoons really could have been better

the buffalo chicken po-boy and thee Argentinean po-boy we had the next morning and were very good cold though we recognized that warm they would have been absolutely delicious.

(see my reviews of the other green location and nami for more about the menu!). So much fun! It was almost like karaoke and pizza combined. We got a seat at the bar, and had fun bartenders. I am partial to east coast thin dough pizza, and ours was perfect. We sang along as we ate, good times!. After an absolutely horrible experience with another local swim school, we found Katrina with All Star Swim Academy. Katrina was patient, yet consistent and firm with our four-year-old. After a few lessons she was able to completely earn his trust and make incredible progress with our fearful little guy. He now loves to swim and can't wait to go each time. 

It's too bad we moved out-of-state as we were looking forward to another season of swim lessons with Katrina in her new facility. 

I strongly recommend All Star Swim Academy, especially when compared to other swim schools in the area.. Le Thai is just opening up.
I went in for the spicy Thai soup on Sunday and it was a warm and welcomed treat on a cold Las Vegas day. 
The staff were inviting, and my beer cup never got empty.
I am by no means a Thai afficionado, but this food was yummy.
I welcome this spot in a sea of overly fancy Las Vegas "Top Chef" restaurants.
Sometimes, quality and positivity go a lot further than a "rating" that was given by someone I have never even met.

I encourage you to make up your own mind and quit using yelp as a crutch.

Cheers.. Went there for pre Valentines dinner. 
My new favorite sushi bar on my side of town.
Eric is the best sushi chef in Las Vegas. And all the servers are super nice. Of couse sushi is so fresh and food from kitchen are top notch. Best of all, soon they will open until 4AM. I'm so glad good business is growing.. The Epicurean experience is fabulous and should not be missed.    Delicious different and entertaining.    The chefs are inviting and it's fun to watch this well orchestrated kitchen working.  Get there at 5:30 and enjoy.. So enjoyed the courteous service and pleasant atmosphere here. The food was delicious and  plenty of it! We definitely plan to return soon.. I've been to numerous bridal & evening gown stores in the valley. I've hated all of them. I found a dress on line by Marys Bridal, the informal collection. I called all 12 stores who are suppose to carry it in the valley, Prescott, Flagstaff, and Tucson looking for this dress. Not one store had it. By this time, I've already tried on 45 dresses. I've hated 44 of them. I really liked this dress a great deal. When I called Molina Bridal, I spoke to Heather. She said she had a similar dress with the identical cut. No one out of the 11 other stores suggested this to me. She said if I tried it on and liked it, she could order me the Mary's Bridal dress I was looking for. I went in the next day. Heather was very nice, honest, and understanding. My attitude wasn't pleasant because I've tried on so many crummy dresses and nothing fit right. She didn't give up on me. I liked her and the other people a lot. She also called the manufacturer and found out they have the dress in stock in my size and I could get it in a week. I ordered it the next day. Their staff is very personable and not because they are putting on a front. They genuinely care about your concerns and make suggestions to help you out. The price was very good and at the low end of the price range for this dress. Their alterations are inexpensive. For body alterations: $40. For a hem: $40. This is nothing compared to the other bridal stores. These alterations would be $150-$200 somewhere else. My dress comes in, in a week. Their dresses are very reasonably priced. Their formal gowns & bridesmaid dresses are priced from $79 on up. Very reasonable. I would highly recommend this store due to their courtesy, knowledge, helpfulness, and prices.. If you like blues, this is where you go.  Period.  There's really not much more to say.  Blues and jazz bands play here almost every night of the week.  Drinks are cheap and the music's fantastic.  Check out local favorites Andy Walo and the surf rock band Thee Swank Bastards playing here.  They won't disappoint.. I LOVE LOVE LOVE THEHotel!!  Here are my reasons... 

1.  If you want to avoid casino floor on the way back to your suite, or after checking into your suite, this is the place. 

2.  If you want a quiet peaceful suite to rest after a marathon of heavy drinking, gambling, partying, pool partying, this is the place.  

3.  If you are looking for luxury stay while having all the fun you can have in Las Vegas, this is the place to stay.  

4.  If you are looking to stay at one Las Vegas Hotel for the majority of the weekend trip, Mandalay Bay and THEHotel offers enough choices for entertainment you don't really have to leave the hotel, except for shopping.  

5.  If you want to avoid smoking gamblers and confusing casino floors, this definitely the place to stay at. 

I cannot tell you how much I enjoy staying at their suite, I have stayed at other major Suite hotels, in comparason TheHotel offers a different lodging experience that everyone can enjoy.. My go to Lebanese take out, I've never actually been inside the restaurant. Their online ordering is so easy and efficient, and they deliver really fast. I absolutely love the selection they have in this store. 

I love the furniture and decorations. There are some really funky things from lamps, chairs to glasses and fondue sets. Really neat stuff. It's pretty fun just to look around and see everything. 

I have the most amazing necklace ever, thanks to them. They have some really unique pieces of jewelry. I  like that I can get a piece that nobody else in town will have, but I don't have to spend a fortune and don't have to sacrifice quality. 

I love the clothes, too. I've bought some of my favorite tshirts and sweaters there. Last time I went, I found the most awesome, vintage, Illini sweater. If you like cook, vintage Illini clothes, they had a ton last time I was there.

It's worth it to go in and take a look. Lots of fun things to see and buy!. In a nutshell, this place is fuckin bomb. The service was a little slow today, but they were swamped with people and only one cute Mexican lady was working. My boyfriend got the flammin pulled pork samdwich, I got a small, I repeat SMALL order of pastrami chili fries with grilled onions. It was actually pretty fast for a little joint and one cook doing register AND drive through. People are just impatient. This place is the awesome.

Edit: I vaguely temper getting a terrible stomach ache after this......one that hurt so bad I was doubled over in pain for hours. Coinsidence....or nah?. Loved it! 
My first try was with their fresh lemon curd cupcake and was amazing!
As recommended by the staff, the salted caramel brownie is also very good.
Both goes well with a cup of coffee :)
Can't wait to come back for their mostly recommended breakfast sandwich!. I had a hankering for an egg roll one day. Sometimes these things happen. If you don't judge me, I won't judge you. I poked around on my Yelp App until I found a decent place near to where I was lurking that day. Soho Bistro has a rather fancy website that I found I couldn't resist!

I ordered a few things, because you can't just get egg rolls. What about when you are also craving crab rangoon? And, hey, look they've got honey walnut prawns on the menu. Seaweed salad? That sounds healthful, and I tend to like seaweed. Let's do it!

- Egg rolls - straightforward. did the job.
- Crab rangoon - really really mushy and had.. carrot in there? shredded carrot? I can't say I liked it.
- Honey walnut prawns - No. They were fried and came in a thick brown sauce with vegetables. This is not what it's supposed to look like. These were definitely NOT the droids I was looking for.
- Seaweed salad - Awesome, if a bit plain. I could have done without the pointless bed of shredded lettuce on the bottom. But the seaweed itself was awesome.
- Sauce - The sweet and sour sauce that generally comes with the fried goodies was really weird here. It was really dark red and syrupy, and did not taste very pleasant. I can't recommend it.

Huge bonus points for 
1. having a great website 
2. having a menu on the website. 
3. being able to order online. 
4. having a REALLY awesome staff person answer the phone, answer questions, and even brought my food to the curb before I even slowed to a stop.

The place is definitely different, but I'm willing to give some of the other stuff a try. Being Chinese, I'm really picky about my Chinese food, and I've already rejected most of the other joints in the area.. Reminds me of the deli's in Italy where you eat among the groceries. Awesome desserts, Good Sandwiches and the Gnocci is outstanding. Nice to have a good meal with a glass of wine at relax on their patio.. Bartender---Howard is cool, cocktails r great n the spot is super-chill.  The best hummus I have ever had, and it is free with check in!. The food is yummy and the service is great!. This boutique is absolutely amazing! Cathy and Greg and so nice and have a beautiful store. They have a huge selection of clothing and jewelry and I always find something I love! Diva Divine is definitely worth checking out and you'll be hooked after your first visit!. Best dehydrated lamb lung dog treats anywhere!. My favorite dining establishment in all of Pittsburgh! The food is amazing -- I brought my family here because it was really the best thing I'd eaten in the entire city.  I love their sandwiches (not really a fan of crepes, but that is not their fault!).  The coffee is also truly fantastic.  

The salad they serve with sandwiches is well above typical side salad fare.  The day I went for the prix fixe breakfast, we had the best caesar salad I've had at an eating establishment, incredible pulled pork crepes, and a nice dessert crepe.  Honestly? I could have eaten that salad all day -- and the amount they served of it just about let me.

This is easily my favorite place to get away from campus and school and study, eat, or just think. I'm truly sad that I haven't been able to get out as much as I'd like to this semester.. The Alaskan New England Clam Chowder was amazing.  With chunks of lobster, crab and shrimp. The soup was very flavorful and rich.  I don't like my chowder spicy so I got  a 2 which was perfect, I would say 2 is less than mild. The combo pan roast was also very yummy with chunks of seafood in it too. We got ours spicy level 4 which had a little punch but I would still consider it mild.  We had 3 people and it was more than enough food, they charge a $5 split fee. 

The wait was long! Almost 2 hours. We got there at 1015 PM on a Saturday and got seated about 1215 AM. You have to stand in line for to-go orders too.  There is no sign in list, you just have to stand and wait. The food is great tho! I've had equally amazing pan roast at the Kettle Bar at the Anaheim Packing House so not sure if I'd do it again. I've never had better Chowder tho. Vegas has so many great food options so I probably wouldn't do the wait again, but I would recommend everyone trying it once, just be prepared for the line.. We have eaten here many times and always had a great meal!  Love their salsa bar.  The green lime/guac sauce was a big hit. Just got our AC serviced thru Flores AC today. Our AC went out in the middle of the night and I called Flores around 9am after reading good reviews on Yelp. We have a very old ac unit, but not the funds to replace the unit right now, they fixed for 380 bucks, replaced the condenser motor. They were fast to get here, quick to fix, explained the process, and even came in and took the time to let us know the air filters we were using were bad(whoops!) Only reason 4 stars is I am wondering if we could have gotten slightly cheaper....but it was an emergency call and looking on web I think we paid around the range of what we were supposed to. Would 100% recommend!. First of all, best Mojitos! It's hard to find a good Mojito in this town for some reason, but Sol does it right. The tacos are great and the ambiance is way cool. The service was a little slow and we had to ask for our server a couple times. We were there on a Monday night and it was not very busy so I'm not sure what the deal was there. I have been in on the weekends as well but have only sat at the bar, which is cool as it's one that's inside/outside. They're typically packed on the weekends and I would recommend a reservation. Overall great spot in the Quarter for Mexican with an upscale feel without the upscale price!. Our Labradoodle loves going to Always Unleashed! We take him there once a week for playtime and always have him stay there when we go out of town. The facilities are amazing!!! I can not imagine a place being nicer than this. Awesome pool, misters, play area, plenty of shade, fans, toys, etc..... All of the staff we have interacted with are so nice and love Charlie!!!! So happy to have this awesome place so close to our house!. Day trip to Phoenix.  We asked a girl at the car rental counter for a good place to eat.  She recommended Comedor Guadalajara. 
The place was packed and it was Tuesday at 9am.
I ordered the Chilaquiles, Machaca and Huevos. 
it was delicious.  Last time I had chilaquiles this good... I was in mexico.  
The beans were delicious...the flour tortilla was huge.  
I definitely will be back!. I have been going to Dr Perez for almost 2 years and I brought my 4 year old in this past week. I was worried that the exam would be too difficult and couldn't be done but we were there for about 2 hours and everything went so smooth. He is very thorough and I feel so relieved now that my daughter has glasses now and this is her first pair. They have a few children frames that are very stylish and priced very reasonable but I do wish that they had more. I'm worried that they might not be very comfortable since they had none of the glasses with the soft flexible tip thingies on them. Regardless, the glasses were ready in 3-4 days and my daughter loves them and that is all that matters.. Ginormous portions us an understatement. I ate an appetize, that was filling. My husband had breakfast for dinner. Easily all the dinner meals that we saw coming from the kitchen could be fir two or three people. 

It was a little loud fir my taste shock us the reason for the four stars, and our waiter forgot my drink refill. Other than that pretty good food.. It was such a treat to be out here after a couple of days of rain in AZ. The dessert was in bloom and there is absolutely nothing like running dessert trails in the beautiful state of Arizona. 

Because of time constraints, we opted to loop around Treasure trail for a short run/hike. I was really sorry not to have brought a real camera. It was so beautiful out there. Like any other state farms, I would not go on a weekend to enjoy the park more.. Because of the wonderful "Hell's Kitchen" I have "get a cooking lesson from Chef Ramsey" on my bucket list. Unfortunately the man is a very busy man, so going to his restaurant is the closest thing I've got. 

Service: They definitely lost a star because of the service. Our reservation was at 10:00pm, got there at 9:45pm and they weren't ready until 10:20pm. We waited at the bar area until my boyfriend went to ask about our table. And the hostess that followed him back to the bar laughed & said "oh I thought it was just him, I didn't know you were waiting with him". My boyfriend & I looked at each other with the "um, okay?" look. The waiter was also not very good. The only person I liked a lot was the server Devon. He helped me take pictures, refilled my water & checked up on us. 

Food: A-MA-ZING. obviously the restaurant is in Vegas so the prices are pretty expensive, but the main entrees are bomb! I ordered the King Crab legs and even though it was 4 pieces, it really fills you up. We also got the asparagus but it didn't taste as good as ones from other restaurants. Same goes for the mash potatoes. 

I'd recommend this place! BUT I would skip the sides and go straight for the gold. We definitely could have done it without the not-so-bomb sides.. Delicious chicken wings!!!

It's all I eat from this joint...

They are not breaded (naked) and definitely meaty!!

I'm there once a week. Neighborhood dive bar with amazing wings!!. Had carryout. But the food was really good! Had been wanting to come here but never got the chance and now that i went im glad i did. been wanting new taste of food for while. The restaurant has a Great Atmosphere Ben though I didn't eat there. Will def be coming back to try something new.. Stopped in to buy some yarn while vacationing.   Very sweet, knowledgeable and helpful staff.   Fantastic selection! Can't wait to move to Scottsdale.   This will be my new LYS!. Amazing customer service and family friendly!
The staff always pays close attention to detail and I am always pleased with the work they do on my car. Not only am I happy with the way my car looks when I leave but the kid and family friendly experience makes going to the car wash fun for my kids. They have a water gun for my kids to spray the incoming cars as well as a gaming system and balloons for them to play with.. I have zero complaints about this place. I always go through the drive thru and my drinks are always made exactly how I ordered. The customer service has been great every visit as well!. Ordered the whiting fish dinner and it was a much better portion than my last visit. I think I ordered the sandwich portion previously.  I got my money's worth and the fish was good. The sides were just ok the cornbread was also delicious!. I took my one and two year old here.  They had fun.  I think the "big kid" area was a little overwhelming for my two year old.  It was very clean.  Four stars because its a bit $$$.  It was $18 for both my children.. Fresh and excellent sushi! I've been going here since 2005 and always get great service and excellent food. I especially enjoy going for happy hour from 5pm-7pm and sitting at the sushi bar.

This place is tucked away in the corner of a strip mall and has an intimate vibe. It's great for a date night or for a night out with some friends. It's best to make reservations on the weekends, though, because it gets quite busy. 

My favorites: pan-fried gyoza, spicy tuna roll, Shimogamo roll, panko roll, spider roll, tsunami roll, caterpillar roll & rainbow roll.. The Spicy Noodles and Pad Thai were excellent! The portions were a good size too and I got two full meals out of it. I wish they served alcohol but at least now I have a great local thai place that looks super easy to pick up from.. I went here with 13 other women for dinner.  The waiters told us we could stay when the place turns into a night club, but we didn't.   Rumjungle itself was a beautiful place.  I guess you have to be to compete in Vegas.   These places in Vegas are used to accommodating large parties and were attentive and patient to all our demanding needs during the course of our meal.  That part was a huge plus.  

About half of our table ordered the smorgasbord of all you can eat fare, where they just bring out tons and tons and tons of food kind of like cafe de brazil or whatever.  I was one of the fools that didn't order that option.  I ordered the seared ahi tuna instead.  It was good, but that all-you-can eat was scrumptious!!!  I have never regretted not ordering all-you-can-eat in my life!  I was nervous to order that all you can eat b/c I didn't think I could eat that much.  The price difference was something like $4 so what did it matter?  

Anyway, in vegas, they don't care if you didn't order the stuff your face meal.  1/2 the table did, so the staff encouraged us non-all-you-can- eat ppl to dig in too!  That was kind of surprising and another plus.  Boy was it good.  Fried plantains.  Coconut rice. Pulled pork. mmmm.

yeah. order that all-you-can-eat stuff.  don't be a fool like me.. If only it were closer but it's well worth the drive.  It's tucked away in a plaza in Cave Creek.  The interior is very geriatric but the food is amazing!  

We split a sausage pizza and I can't remember the last time I had sausage that fresh!  Yummy!  Everything is made from scratch so you don't have that bloated feeling after you devour half a pizza packed with preservatives.

Next time I will try the tasty desserts that were staring me down as I left.. I am a retired gymnast who suffered with a pinch sciatic and achy back until attending this facility. Scott is fantastic and is truly skilled and knowledgable, able to diagnose and alleviate my pain. I recommend going if you are living with any type of pain. It is worth it!!!. Stopped by last night for dinner. Immediately I knew I would like this place when I saw the exposed brick and wooden accents and heard Hozier and alt J over the speakers. I had the "eat the rainbow" which was literally that. Rainbow colored veggies over a bowl of lemony greens with three different homemade dipping sauces - pesto, ginger, and some kind of yellow ranch tasting sauce. The veggies were crisp and fresh and the dish was filling - lots of different colored cauliflower, broccoli, and baby squash. I really enjoyed all the colors visually too. My boyfriend had the fried chicken which was moist yet not greasy and the sides of mashed potatoes and kale salad complimented really well. It looked so good I had to steal a bite. Try the Lee Trevino cocktail! It's got a unique flavor and a surprising kick from the habanero. Can't wait to explore this place for breakfast and lunch.. This was one of the best brunches I've had anywhere. The servers were very knowledgeable and eager to share their opinion on what's best on the menu. Honestly, everything looked appealing. The portions are fair, the prices even fairer, and the food all excellent. My waffle with two slices of bacon was the best waffle and best bacon I've had. Bacon was thick, not too fatty, and perfectly charred. Waffle had texture and crisp. Real maple syrup on the side :) The special chorizo, jalapeno scramble was nice and hot and spicy! Definitely coming back.. Food: Interesting mix of Asian and Spanish-ish dishes. Fantastic vegetarian options for both, we got the stuffed eggplant and it was amazing.

Drinks: Best Sake I've ever had. Good wine selections, way more bottles than glasses, well-priced mixed drinks, limited beer.

Service: excellent.

Atmosphere: decor and lighting are romantic, tables are really close together though.

Overall: I would return, especially for specials like half off appetizers from 4-6:30. I love this place so much! I live within walking distance and by my third visit, I was already clearly a "regular".  Their breakfast burrito is the BEST breakfast burrito in town, which you can customize to your exact preference.  The ingredients are fresh and the burrito is HUGE -- it's my number one go to "brunch" order when I know I probably won't eat again until very late (and skipped breakfast).

It's cute and quaint and 100% local.  My kinda diner.. Holy cannoli.  I was expecting the cheez, but they brought so much more.

Not so easily bemused girls will be.  Guys are hot, chiseled, and athletic. Not enough skin? Turn on a damn computer if you want to see dong. You get enough here. Come on ladies, it's hotter during the leadup than the real thing sometime. If you watch this and don't wish you were the audience member being laid down on a picnic table by a muscular guy with no shirt on listening to the crowd cheer her on, then you have no soul.

The audience really makes it, though.  Make sure the bride wears something like white, a veil, a sash, a bullseye, whatever - get her on stage.  Nothing beats seeing one of your best friends have to fake an orgasm on stage alongside another bride with a giant inflatable penis named, "Sergeant Pecker." Nothing.  And the free Hypnotiq-flavored lip gloss from the grab bag you win for not having the best fake orgasm is not that bad either. Be prepared to lose your voice from screaming and your mind from visuals.. been going here for 20 years great place to eat. watched George grow up through the years good kid. This location is closer to the strip which is a plus, however, I feel like the one on Decatur had more extra stuff. I'm pretty sure I was able to get halo-halo at the one on Decatur.

Anyway, I ordered my usual adobo omelet and it was just as good as I remembered. I love eating it with some sriracha. Since it is massive in size, I had leftovers for lunch the next two days. The portions are large, which is always enjoyable. You get your monies worth!. My friends had been raving about the breakfasts at The Bluebird for months - so finally I was in the city early enough to go and check it out.

Everything about the place was just lovely. From the cosy space of the cafe itself to the friendly staff - it really lived up to its great reputation.

I went straight for the stack of buttermilk pancakes, bacon and maple syrup and was not disappointed. The pancakes were fluffy and sweet, the bacon crispy and smokey. I promptly smothered it all in the maple syrup and happily inhaled the lot.

The only thing that was wrong was that I was too full to eat the sourdough toast I had also ordered. 

Next time for sure.. Broth is DELICIOUS!! And they give soooo much meat! (Got the combination beef pho) tuge definately revived me after last night lol. I quite enjoy the atmosphere of this mom and pop shop. The waiters are friendly and serve attentively and the music is pleasant to listen to. Pasta nights are nice because you can get most of the pastas for under $10. You can add a salad for $2 more and it is worth it. I love the dressing it comes with. It is a tart flavor with olive oil over it and a bit of cheese. The initial meal starts with their bread which is usually warm and fresh out of the oven. It comes with a vinegarette that is just divine. The broccoli and pasta dish was quite light and did not make me feel bloated like most Italian places. I liked the veal combo as well where it came with a side of pasta and your choice of sauce. I think the veal was well done and thinly sliced to retain the perfect texture. The pasta on the side was a bit overcooked but not to the point of mushiness so it was negligible. I had a cannoli and it was pretty good. The sweetness was not too overwhelming and there was a balance of crisp to cream and chocolate sauce. The meal here seemed very light and balanced and the place is cozy.. I come here every morning for my coffee and bagel.  They know my order and are SUPER friendly.  It's not the closest D&D to my house, but this is the one I go to for their service.. Previously we would only stop in the Pass for the budget breakfast in the diner on the way to Boulder City. A couple of months ago, a friend told us about the Steakhouse. I never would of imagined there would be such a thing. We decided to make it our "dress up date night". To our surprise, it was VERY nice! The food was amazing. You really do get your money's worth too! A couple played the piano and sang making the ambience very pleasing. The best part was our waiter JUSTIN. He was very professional and showed he loved his job.  
My birthday just passed, and when asked what I wanted, I replied "let's take the family to the Steakhouse so they can have the same experience we had". Again, another GREAT experience! The best part? JUSTIN was our waiter again! This definitely will be one of our " nice go to places" and one to refer to anyone!. Wow this place has gotten a LOT of bad reviews! I am surprised. I do not consider this a bad place. I was stuffed from the 6 meat sauce plus homemade noodles, my husband had the Oso Busco. It is small, but they do not force you out or make you feel uncomfortable talking over your meal (unlike some other restaurants). 
My food was lovely and a generous portion, we did have desert and coffee as well. 
For those of you who had a bad server or a bad run in with "the boss" I did not have that experience at all. The service was friendly, and the boss was helping some VERY nasty people at a table near us and trying to be accommodating as best as he could. I never am one to complain about decore or seating, if you are giving me good food, I will sit on a stump, so the plastic chairs do not bother me. I would say give it a try..... Wow! This place was amazing! It beyond exceeded my expectations. The lobster ravioli (homemade), the beef tenderloin and the specialty cocktails are all incredible. Oh, and the mac-n-cheese was amazing too! Please check this place out! It's to die for!. Although Monroeville is local-ish, I am a total tourist when strolling The Strip!

I love the shops and never leave empty-handed (or hungry!!), but destination is not typically narrowed beyond "The Strip".  

Great art shops, many cultures, bustle? puts Miss Kitty to shame!, fantastic smells, seafood galore and 100% Pittsburgh.

My rating math is this:  6-stars minus one for parking!  Five it is--

Hoping that another benefit of empty-nest is becoming a Strip regular!  Wish me luck!. I came here for lunch during the work week last week. Bonsai is located inside of 7th Street Market. Haven't been to 7th Street Market yet??....put down your computer and go, like, now!

I decided to order the sushi burrito. After I ordered, they gave me a card to put on the table I was sitting at so that they can bring it out to me when it was ready. Took about 10 minutes or so, which was very quick.

The sushi burrito was in a spinach wrap and had spicy tuna, edamame hummus, lettuce, msc veggies, rice, some kind of sauce, and jalapenos. Great size portion and very filling. Next time, I am ordering sans jalapeno because that thing was spicy!! This burrito was so tasty and I thought the spicy tuna in it was very fresh tasting. Definitely will be ordering again!. We went to a baby shower this t skinny fats catered a few months ago and loved the food so we have been dying to come eat at the actual restaurant,  we finally are it here today and my daughter and I just found one of our new favorite places!!!!  We ordered the Tu-nuts and it was delicious I loved everything on it we also ordered the Ahi taco-San and they were so filling and I loved every bite,  the place is up beat and cute and I can't wait to come back and try several other things on the menu!!  Well done skinny fats!!!!. ***FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE ONLY*** 


I say speak to Brandon when you check in and out! I've been going here for years for basic oil changes, the service technicians tend to screw up here and there but the oil change is cheap($31.00 [get a punch card and it's $26.00] and they rotate your tires for free. 

Up until last Monday I would only go on Saturdays when I needed an oil change. But this one time I went during the week and received the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE I have ever received at THIS PLACE. Not only was Brandon courteous and polite- he didn't bullshit me. I asked how long it would be w/out an apt - he said an hour- and an HOUR it was! at check out- he said "Your car looks great, just get a new air filter" PLAIN AND SIMPLE- whereas the other times the CHECK OUT GUY is always telling me whats wrong with my vehicle and always trying to sell me useless products or upgrades that I don't need (My car is brand new BTW). 
Only thing about this particular auto shop is that they always screw up something. One time they lost the air screw to my tire- this last time- they didn't put the hub cap on right and it came off while I was driving! But the only difference is that this time when I called Brandon and explained my situation- he was completely understanding and did not hesitate to replace my hub cap free of charge- PLAIN and SIMPLE- NO BULLSHIT. In the Auto business, mechanics/Techs never admit they're wrong nor do they take responsibility for their mistakes and then offer to pay- nothing is free. So I was very impressed on how well he handled the situation. BRAVO!. I totally forgot I saw this place on Buffet Paradise from Travel Channel. I can definitely we why because they had such amazing service, super great tasting food and a lovely interior. The price for dinner was expensive but it was worth it. I definitely want to come back when I return to Vegas!. We had caramel ice cream. It was the best ever as it had nice flavour but not sickly sweet. We also had the macaroons which were delicious. Raspberry ice cream, coffee and chocolates were delicious also. Friendly service and relaxing to sit inside or outside and people watch. Highly recommended.. Best pizza in Charlotte. The reasons:
1. Generous toppings
2. Flavorful, robust sauce.
3. Gooey, delicious cheese.
4. Creative menu.
5. Fantastic specials. 
6. Terrific service.
7. Awesome locations.
8. Good beer & specials. 
9. An A+ to-go system.
10. Consistent excellence.. Love this place!!! Great place to listen to music. Come and hear Krystal and Elise sing!!! Amazing!!!. This is, without a shadow of doubt, my favorite festival in Pittsburgh!  

Where else can you be entertained, check out unique art and stuff your face with oh so bad but oh so good fair food?!  At the Three Rivers Arts Festival my friend!  Nothing kicks off the start of summer in Pittsburgh quite like a trip down.

It's been so interesting watching the fest evolve with the times as well  as the change in venue.  For ages the fest was completely down at Point State Park.  The park then was closed in 2006 for remodeling.  Those were some sad times in terms of placement.  

I remember the one year they had the stage right in the middle of the intersection of Liberty and Stanwix.  It had rained (which some say is an Arts Fest curse) and the whole thing was a mud pit.  Throw in that it was a tiny space with a lot of people jammed in and you've got some issues.  I didn't mind them switching the booths to Gateway Center, although it can definitely get more crowded than when it was completely in the park.  

When the park finally reopened in 2008 they kept most of the art booths in Gateway Center and the concessions at the park along with the stage  The one change was that they were all located at the beginning of the park.  I'm not really a fan of where the stage is placed.  I miss it being on the inside of the park instead of being on the outside edge.  From what I understand, and this could be a total rumor, they didn't want too many people walking and trampling the grass inside.  That's lame if that is the truth....it's a park!

And although sadly I can't afford a lot of the various pieces of art on display, it is really interesting to see what people come up with.  I'm a total Pittsburgh nerd in the fact that I love seeing all the Pittsburgh themed artwork.  It's a fun way to see an artists interpretation of the city.  I also love watching the different themes that come in over the years.  This year it seemed as if glass Mosaic artwork was popular.

My all time favorite booth is the Illustrations done by Greg Stones.  He's been here for the past couple years and I'm proud to say it was my first piece of artwork I bought from the fest!  Yay!  He does goofy little illustrations with penguins, sheep and zombies just to name a few.  You MUST check out his site.

The music varies from year to year but they've brought in some great artists.  Some even before they broke out into the "big time," like Norah Jones and The Black Keys.  I've also enjoyed seeing Aimee Mann and an incredible 3 hour set by Wilco.  

Of course, who can go here without indulging in a kielbasa and kraut dog or a fried Oreo?  Glutenous or culinary creation?  You be the judge!  Either way, I always leave happy, stuffed and just a little bit more cultured!. LOVE the food!!!!. Strange little place, but I liked it.  I found the food to be fresh, hot and delicious.  I would go again. The portions on the fries were huge.                                                      I fear for this business, I never see any cars there.. Love love love this place. I can always rely on a good breakfast from them. Thank you.. What a great place! 
Friendly servers,  amazing pizza, great wine selection! 
Cory, Maddy, Adrian and Ryan are amoung my favorites.
There is always a new pizza to try.
I love the bright fun atmosphere and wonderful food!. The guy (cashier)who helped us was awesome. We tried the vegan chili. Yummy. The tree of life pita...oh my. So good. My brother who is not vegan loved it. I got all kinds of bake goods too. All of them good. I recommend the brownie chocolate chip cookie. Everything was awesome. Definitely coming back. :) Thank you to the cashier guy who was wonderful. :). Dr Misty is a great Chiropractor!!  A lot of great things have already been said about her and I agree with all of them!!!

I do have to share on ething,  I have been wearing a tommy Copper ankle sleeve for about a year now to help with the pain in my foot, due to bad arches.
D r Misty took one look at the sleeve and asked what the problem was and adjusted by foot!  I am now sleeve free and when the pain comes back, I go back to Dr Misty!!!
I love feeling good when I leave her office and standing a bit taller as well :-). such a great place, our waitress and the manager of the restaraunt was so nice and welcoming. amazing and fresh food. the fresh squeezed orange juice was fantastic.. My grass is greener!!!  Call Ryan, dependable, professional & on time.  My rental property needed a major clean up.  Ryan went over the same day, gave me a reasonable quote and a few days later DONE!  I hired him for monthly upkeep as well.  Nice to find hard working people that have pride in what they do.  Don't settle call Vegas Valley Lawn Care.. Dined here with my fiancé and had a really great meal with attentive service.

We tried several dishes including the steamed dim sum selection, sesame prawn toast with foie gras and silver cod roasted in champagne. All were tasty!

In particular I really liked the ambience of Hakkasan- the tables are far apart and the decor separates the dining room into sections which creates an intimate dining experience.

We found out that if you dine at the restaurant you can return later with your receipt and access the nightclub through the Hakkasan lounge area, bypassing the line. Dining here meant that we gained access to the nightclub for free which was an added bonus!. I love anything the Aiello's do in the culinary world (awesome folks in every other way too).  Love the restaurant on Central but a tad bit far and expensive for frequent consumption so this smaller different twist on classic Italian is just right for me.  I usually get the eggplant parm cause it is the best in the Valley, but wandered off the traditional path and had the featured sandwich, Aiello's House Salumeria.  All the ingredients complimented each other so nicely that the result is a masterpiece of a sang-which!!!. It was ladies night last night and it fell on Taco Tuesday. Loco Patron was a huge hit. The ladies and I filled up a booth with laughter and fun without breaking the bank. From 3pm-Midnight you can score great tasting food and margarita's for an affordable price. $1.00 Tacos, $4.00 Wings in various flavors, $4.00-$5.00 Margarita's and much more. The ladies at my table enjoyed the Strawberry Margarita's at $5.00 a piece. Freshly made and brought to your right away they helped wash down our $1.00 Tacos and upgraded Steak, Fish Taco's for $2.00 bucks. Even though we were given Chips and Salsa to start our food came so quick it was quite the surprise not having to wait long for our food. 

Service was great. We started at the bar and were served by a friendly bartender then we headed to a table near the DJ booth and was served by a server who was on the ball. I mentioned DJ because they have one from 7pm-Midnight. DJ Matt in the hat took our request and spin the night away. 

You don't have to be a starving student to enjoy Taco Tuesdays. We were a bunch of business woman who needed a night out and it was worth every penny. Will do it again!. My friend and I came here for lunch one day...  This place is amazing! Gluten free, vegan AND it tasted delicious.. My brother recently moved to Pittsburgh so my family and I were visiting him and looking for a place to go to breakfast. We settled on Dor-Stop. Walking in, it looks like your typical hole-in-the-wall diner, very small with not a ton of seating which is ok because they get people in and out fast. We put our name in and waited about 15 minutes then seated at our table. My mom ordered a egg white omelette, my brother ordered a sausage an cheese omelette, I ordered one banana chocolate chip pancake and a Western omelette, and my dad ordered some pancakes and eggs with some sausage. 

The pancakes were amazing. Very delicious, fluffy and large. . Everyone else was satisfied with their meal. If I were to get here again I would order just pancakes or some of their french toast. My omelette was good but nothing amazing. If you want good pancakes and french toast then I would go to Dor-Stop their eggs and other menu items weren't terrible by any means just nothing to write home about.. We've used SumoMaya twice so far (within a week) for Business meetings.  The food was excellent, everyone who ate with us has been raving about it, and the service was top notch.  They went far over and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed to host a successful business meeting, and not only do we plan to return for future business meetings, I plan to eat here personally as the food was so wonderful, as I'm sure everyone else that ate with us will do.  Best service in town.  Jason, the General Manager, went way over and beyond to accommodate us (very successfully so), Chef Jo (Joanna) was a delight to chat with and listen to describing the amazing dishes they served us, and Lucia was absolutely amazing and so helpful.  The presentation of the food was carefully put together making everyone's mouths water before even taking a bite (and then it tasted even better than it looked).  Fantastic all around, we definitely HIGHLY recommend using SumoMaya for your personal AND business lunch or dinner meetings.. A first rate way to spend an afternoon with the family.  This zoo is run entirely through endowment funds, and is free to the public--though donations are appreciated.  Great exhibits, with new ones being added.  The surrounding park and arboretum are beautiful.  Bring a cooler and a grill and make a full day of it!. Early dinner before the Chaparral High School football game.  Got right in with no problems, well I guess so, it was 5:30.  Our server was very sweet, she asked if we wanted a sample of Pinot Noir. We didn't.  She gave me a good recommendation for wine and she was very personable and seemed to enjoy her job.  So nice to see happy employees!  
My dad knew what he wanted, he orders it everytime, the chicken tequila fettichini with extra limes.  I usually do a pizza but splurged and went for the pesto cream penne.  I enjoyed it but I was confused with them calling it pesto. I didn't see much if any pesto. And the cream sauce was hardly there the penne was dry on the top. It looked like the sauce was not mixed in with the pasta.  Some of the penne tasted undercooked.  Overall, the dish was ok. Probably won't order it again.  Might just stick with the pizza next time.. I went in for a facial and hair cut and color. I am always nervous trying new places but I needed to find a place downtown since I just moved there. The facial was amazing and I had my hair done by Staci and LOVE what she did with my cut and color. She did exactly what I asked and it turned out perfect! The salon is beautiful and the entire staff was nice and welcoming! So glad I found a salon downtown that I love!. I've been trying to decide whether to give this place four or five stars and it's a pretty close call. Last night was my first time at Pho Mailan as I'm new to the area. My first impression was a good one; clean, airy, comfortable atmosphere. Service was quick and I had nothing to complain about. There also seemed to be a lot of regulars which is always a good sign. The broth was fragrant and light, and was topped with plenty of greens and vegetables which I love. Pho is one of my favorite things ever, so I've had quite a bit in my day. I like to feel good about myself when I eat Pho, so I'm bummed when I get broth that is dark and oily and I feel disgusting afterwards. This had none of those qualities so I am assuming they don't use MSG, can't swear to it since I'm not an expert, but I felt nothing but happy about having a belly full of hot soup. My only complaint is that they only have two sizes for Pho... I would be thrilled to see an extra large on the menu. I also didn't see an "extras" section on the menu where you can double up on meat, get add on's etc., but I will definitely be asking the next time I go for Pho because I'll be back for sure.. Love love love Biscuits!  Always good when we go and that's usually 1-2 times a week.  Chicken fried steak is delicious and so is the almond crusted French toast! Service is great,  people are friendly and never a long wait!  Would recommend biscuits to anyone and everyone.. This place has an amazing happy hour after midnight! Their steaks are half off and very good. The atmosphere is fun and great to when your on a date of with a big group of people. I didn't expect this place to be as good as it is. I was definitely impressed by the food, service and atmosphere.. You can often get this hotel pretty cheap on websites like hotel.com, and it's nicer than other options in its lower price range. One big draw for me was that the casino wasn't smokey or smelly. It actually smelled good if you can believe that, but it's true. 

POOL: The pool area was busy, and there were several pool options, including a wave pool and a lazy river. It had a family-friendly-Holiday Inn vibe to it, even though there were a lot of drunk twenty-somethings wandering around. The hot tub was dominated by people who would've been great models for Ed Hardy swimwear. 

ROOMS: Our room was nice with traditional decor. Mostly simple with white and gold decorations. Our room was clean, and the bed was very comfy. On our floor, it was a mix of people wanting to party and families. 

FOOD: The location of Monte Carlo is convenient to a lot of food options, but if you ever get lazy, the buffet is good and the food court is convenient. 

DEAL OR NO DEAL: There is the most amazing slot machine ever--The Deal or No Deal Slot Machine--and there is always a long line to play it, but once you get in, it is really fun and pays out well (for the most part.) This elusive machine isn't found in many casinos in Las Vegas, but there is one machine at Monte Carlo.. I think I found my new favorite sushi joint.  The pricing was very good and the sushi tasted great! Sushi was fresh and can't wait to go back.. Incredible food! If I still lived near Surprise I would probably be there right now, eating delicious pho, spring rolls, and calamari. 

The owner and all of the people who work there are SO friendly and fun to be around. Sometimes I'd plan to get food to go, but when I got there and got talking with them all I found that I didnt want to leave. 

Definitely a place to dine in, get to know everyone, and enjoy the best vietnamese food in all of the Phoenix Area!. I totally get why there are poor reviews for Planet Hollywood, however if you take into consideration the other options for this price range that are this central, this is the better choice. The self parking is a little bit of a walk, but that helps incorporate some work out into the Vegas experience, it can't be more than a quarter mile at most which is five minutes. Check in was fine, can't wave the resort fee, but that's ok considering they let you hook up two devices to their wifi which has a decent connection. Our room was a little wreck-tastic, some dings and scrapes on the furniture, but come on it's Vegas what do you expect for Sin City. 

Why you should stay here: Central location, but not obnoxiously popular like its neighbor Paris hotel. Britney, you need to see her! the Spice Market Buffet! M mall which has Panda Express and a Vladimir Kush gallery. It's across Aria :) also near the ghetto oasis, .99 tall boys on the strip whoa! PH used to be the Aladdin hotel (which was my favorite, sad they closed it), but they kept parts of Agribah at the shops.  

We had the buffet of buffet pass which was $60 after tax on a weekday, supposedly the prices go up on the weekend or holidays. You can use the buffet pass up to five times on a handful of buffets within 24 hours, it averages to $20 a meal if you use it three times, we managed to use it five times! We only went to Spice Market and Le Village. Don't forget to tip your server! Spice Market is huge, they're open until 11pm and there's never a line (weekdays that is)! There's an Asian section, Mexican, Middle Eastern, Seafood, Soups, Salads, Desserts, Italian and American (prime rib, ham roasts, turkey etc). We grabbed dinner after the Britney show, classic Vegas madness. 

While most will disagree with me that this is a good hotel, I suggest coming here and seeing it for yourself! 

Tips: Check out the Container Park which is on Fremont and 7th just three blocks from the casino madness. Also check out Neon Museum, book your tour in advance. Downtown Las Vegas has a lot to offer and is in a way more interesting than the strip. The strip will always be more fun due to all the shows, clubs bars and gambling... but if you're a graphic designer, artist or just into that stuff then you'll appreciate downtown specifically the container park and NEON MUSEUM.. Adobe Animal Hospital was recommended to us by our awesome dog trainer Andrew and we are so glad we found them. I love everything about them-their front office staff, the office decor, the doctors! Everyone is so friendly and really seems to care about my dog.

We recently moved out of state and have been having a hard time finding a new vet for our dog but Adobe Animal Hospital saved the day by expediting a shipment of our dog's meds to us in our new city.

I highly recommend Adobe Animal Hospital!. Very fun it's a great place to take children it has a ride for all ages and for people who have a 1-10 scale of exhilaration it's good for people who like people live like it very very fast!!!!. This high-ceilinged, old-looking, wooden-furnitured pub, located on the Royal Mile has a really convivial atmosphere. I must admit, the first time I went in, it was only because it was pissing it down in Edinburgh, I wanted to get some shelter and pint to warm me up. But I've returned since, so it was really quite a fortunate situation. This pub has a decent array of ales, but it's got nothing on Cloister's or Doctor's or the Blue Blazer. 

Apart from that, it's got all the pub stalwarts, but the atmosphere and the room itself make up for it. The clientele are generally quite mixed, since it's on the Royal Mile, so you get your mixture of regulars, suits, tourists and students. If I could have afforded it I would have eaten, since the food looked pretty tasty from where I was sitting and it seemed people went out of their way to eat there, but I'm normally a bit on the poor side of the money spectrum. 

There's a modern extension out back that lacks the character of the main room, and I wouldn't recommend going there, but it tends to be quite busy so you might find you have no choice in the matter.. I love Cosmopolitan. we got free comps so we stayed here Tuesday till Thursday. the rooms are so spacious and i love how all the rooms have outdoor balconies. we had an amazing view of the Bellagio water show front. our room included a japanese soaking tub which was super relaxing, definitely a great room if you're with your lover/husband/significant other. Theres convenient parking in the garage that is close to the hotel elevators near the East wing of the parking structure. The only negative I would say about the room is that there is no refrigerator, or at least not in the suite we were staying at, only a minibar. I would stay here all the time, but only if we got comps. Otherwise, at $300/night its way out of my budget. :T. I may be a bit biased because i did experience my very first "real" class here, Blue sky is home. Cheryl created an environment that allowed me to grow, encouraged my physical practice, and exposed me to what living my yoga could be. We were in a teeny tiny room upstairs, that was literally black from floor to ceiling and it was so incredibly special that  It then became a place that I wanted to teach at someday. Now we have a much bigger room downstairs with local artists displaying their work on the walls. Very Authentic! A donation based studio in the heart of Las Vegas. All different types of classes with very educated teachers. Very hands on with yummy adjustments. There is a lil something for everyone. There is Mysore in the AM and beginner classes, strong flows, to sweaty slow flows and yin. The teachers are all genuinely passionate about delivering a beautifully inspired class, their students and of Blue Sky itself. Sitting just off the strip within the Arts Factory it is very accessible to tourists, and many workshops are offered throughout the month. I highly recommend! It may not be the prettiest of studios but beauty is only skin deep!. The lunch special is such a good deal. It seems like the portion is so small, however, it really does fill you up. The salad and miso soup on the side was very tasty. I ordered the beef teryaki and it was very chewy. In addition to the food being great, the servers were very kind and welcoming. The atmosphere of the place is clean and petite as well. They also have a sushi bar area. Other than that, i enjoyed lunch. I look forward to trying their other dishes. Oh, they also serve free ice cream when you check in on Yelp! So don't forget to check in :). Second stop on my first night in Montreal (but First Cup. ha ha).  I didn't realize it was a chain coffee shop, until later in my trip - but nonetheless, this is a lovely place for a cup of nice espresso and fantastic selection of pastries (and cheesecake galore).  

I figured hey.. let's go for a cappuccino, although typically I'd run for a latte.  Maybe I thought a cappuccino was more French, in my sleeplessness from the travels.  Anytime after 2pm, and it'll be decaf.  Yeah, blasphemous, but I don't like to please the insomniac in me.  I asked if the pastries are made there, and he said no.  But there were a bunch of these mini loaf cakes in a jar up front.  They looked perfect and cozy.  "Almond shortcake"...  sold.  

Let me tell you, it was one of the best desserts I've had.  Barely sweet, very buttery, and moist as can be.  My kind of dessert.  I almost went back on my final day to pick up a bag of just these.  

Prices are reasonable, and probably $6-7 (I forget exactly).  Great seating up front to catch the view of passers by, heading to and away from Crescent St.

Although it's a chain, I think it's limited to Canada.  Not sure.  If you want a decaf that doesn't taste decaf, and a nice selection of something sweet that isn't necessarily homemade but still quite yummy, give it a try.. Food is just what we expected, great! The service was super slow! 

We just happened to hit this restaurant on a Friday night and they got slammed right after we ordered drinks. They said it was due to surrounding events that caused them to be unusually busy. It took way too long for us to get our drinks and that was right before the major rush hit.

The atmosphere was casual and a bit on the noisy side. Very brightly lit! It is in the middle of a main shopping area. Kind of fun for people watching. I didn't care for my Moscow Mule cocktail. I sent it back. Not sure how they make theirs and couldn't keep the waiter long enough to find out, but they replaced it with another drink. We understood how busy it was, but the waiter didn't even try to explain and or apologize. Nor check back with us on how our food was. We had to ask for the manager. They did comp one of our beers for the wait. We had Alfredo, Pizza and Eggplant. All of which were delicious! 

We recommend Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria! Just check to see how busy they are before you sit down! Vegas can be so unpredictable!. This is one of my favorite places to bring the kids when hubby and I need a night out . You can stay or leave. My kids loved it and had so much fun!. I like how the menu crosses continents.  It's nice to have options.  My husband ordered the ramen.  It's definitely tasty comfort food.  Nothing like the packaged stuff were used to.  I ordered jap chae.  It was a little salty do I marked them down a star.  It would have been nice if my noodles weren't swimming in soy sauce.  The waitstaff is nice but it took a while to get our check and I was starting to get bored since we already ate all of our meal.  To leave this review on a couple of positive notes, I liked the warm bread and sweet baguettes they bring out while you wait.  And the eclectic style of the restaurant was cozy.. Harrah's is where you come if you want to be near the glitz and glamour of Vegas without actually having to pay for it. I've stayed here twice and would stay again - the location is just so perfect and the rooms are great value.

On both occasions (September 2013 & 2014) the rooms were spotlessly clean, nicely sized and very comfortable. The beds are big and the windows seal out all outside noise, so it's easy to get a good night's sleep (if you must). The rooms were serviced every day. 

The first time I stayed here we upgraded to a room in the Mardi Gras tower, which gives you a view of the pool and the luxury of a TV in the bathroom - which, of course, is awesome. However, my regular room was just as comfortable during the second stay and was still close enough to the action despite being at the back of the hotel (it's not a particularly huge resort). So it's up to you whether a TV and nicer view is worth the extra $20 (I think) per night.

Harrah's is not one of Vegas's glamorous resorts, but nevertheless I really enjoy spending time in the casino here. It's laidback but lots of fun, the waitresses are friendly, the drinks come often and are strong and tasty. Everything is clean and comfortable. BUT the best part is you have Caesar's Palace, The Venetian, The Wynn, Mandalay Bay etc all just steps away. There are some great shops and restaurants around this area too. It's my favourite part of the strip, without a doubt.

The pool at Harrah's is nice - again, nothing hugely fancy, but it got a makeover in 2014 and boasts some plush looking beds and loungers (which you need to reserve and, I think, pay for). There's a fun atmosphere around the pool and I enjoyed starting my days here.

I also highly recommend KGB Burger - having staggered in here at 4am I wasn't expecting anything special, but it was a really great burger. All in all, Harrah's is a perfect choice if you're looking for maximum fun on a reasonable budget.. O no I have acquired another habit, The macaroons of Le napoleon , I love them. The location is a little hidden but noting a true foodie couldn't find and this place is well worth it. My favorite flavors that I tried were pistachio, raspberry, coconut, and lavender. I tried other flavors but I though it might be over kill so say they are all my favorite. The texture is light and airy and when I bite into one of these cookies I think this is what a cloud taste like. The chef here told me he had been making macrons for 44 years and it shows. People are born with many talents and his is to bake. I will be visiting here to try different desserts but if the delicacy, artfulness, and skill he posses all shine through in these cookies I don't think I can handle a cake or chocolate made with that level of skillfulness I would 400 pound. So to say this is a five star bakery would be a disgrace. Stop in for your self and taste the 10 star flavors.. Ally & Angie are the best!! We seriously don't go anywhere else now. And Angie is gonna hate me for saying this but.... We bring Pinterest pics in every time and they NAIL them! 

-Ally H. & Rachel. There exists in a quiet small spot in the heart of Scottsdale a little slice of Switzerland!!!  One of the most enchanting shops in our city only equaled by their platinum service & technical expertise!

If you need a clock or timepiece serviced.....this is the only place to go!!!  Expert repair on site by very knowledge people.

If you are looking for a gift what a treasure trove..........some of the most interesting pieces you will find anywhere.

In our city of unparelled shopping this charming store stands alone.  Get out of the heat this summer & take a stroll through Europe!!  You must go just to sit in the mermaid chair as well.

Melinda Schechner
Scottsdale, Az.. We sat at the bar and I had the shredded beef enchildas. Man, that was a lot of food. My husband had the pork tacos, so we traded bites of each others plates. I just loved all of it. Even the rice. The consistency was great, as well as whatever flavoring they add to it. A few nights after eating there, we stopped in for happy hour margaritas (only $4!), and I have to say, those were pretty damn good, too. I only wish we'd done a repeat dinner there instead of barfing up cash at Koi that night.. AMAZING..

I knew the show was going to be good.. but I had no idea how great it was going to be.. the performers are so graceful with the way they portray the various animals on Pride Rock.. 

I loved the ensemble scenes..

The even were in the audience to add to the greatness..

I knew the story getting into it.. so the plot line isn't anything surprising.. most of us know the story of the Lion King movie.. but I was amazed at how well they adapted it for the stage..

Disney really did a great job with it all.. 

I'm glad I got to see this before it goes away in December.. 

The theater is relatively small and our seats, though a few rows away from being completely in the back, were amazing and we were able to see everything at a great angle... I dined here last night. I live nearby and am always hoping to get a great neighborhood restaurant. It's finally here!!! Please check this place out. The decor is simple, it could definitely use some more, to spice it up, but the food was perfect. I wasn't that hungry and ate my entire plate because it was so good! I'll definitely be back!. I can never knock a place that caters to the ladies... Rock Bar makes sure that the gals get their share of free entries and drinks! During my visit in July, the DJ was pretty consistent and played a great variety of Hip Hop and Pop Thursday thru Saturday. It's a great place to stop before or after leaving the PH Casinos. The only drawback is that drinks are measured depending on which bar you go to and can be pretty pricey at times. Ladies should always check them out on Thursday for ladies night where the well drinks are $1!. Nice place, variety of food.  Excellent service.  The menu is a little long and several pages.  It was nice to see the managers making sure the food was going out correctly before the customer received it.. Loved loved loved this cute and cozy place! Tried coconut nigori sake and that was simply delicious.. This store is freaking AWESOME. Its like a zombie preppers Disneyland lol. Hella awesome. If you're visiting Vegas it's not far from the strip at all, definitely recommend taking the time to stop by and check it out. They have quality products and the staff is friendly and helpful. Ill be back next time I roll through Vegas for sure!!. We love this place!!! Best Margarita ever! One of the main reasons we visit Las Vegas!. I've been to the Lanc on several occasions, and have even visited their takeout location at Hogtails. I've been impressed with their service each time - attentive and thoughtful, but by no means hovering or intrusive. 

The food is amazing. It's the best BBQ I've had in the region, bar none. I especially enjoyed the rib special, which was well priced and beautifully prepared. On my last visit I had a shrimp po'boy - delicious! This restaurant is well worth the visit.. Good choice of ingredients, a bit out of a student budget, but it was WORTHY all the way. I was drooling with the flavors! Good environment and good service and good music (bistro style). I'm not much of a pizza eater, but this has a good place in my list! Forget about your papa dough or cheap Sunday pizzas...this is a real one!. LOVE this place. Happy hour is unbelievable. My boyfriend and I go there at least once a week and typically like to sit at the bar when they're not too packed. Certain bartenders usually remember what our drinks of choice are (saki bombs) and you can't beat that.. Its one thing to have a great meal, its another to have it consistently every time... The guacamole is a must and my favorite is the smoked chicken enchilada...heaven.. I love getting coffee and a muffin here on Sunday mornings.  The muffins are as big as your fist, the coffee is fresh and there are several varieties from which to choose.  Prices are more than reasonable.  

I also recently placed an order for two loaves of rye bread for the super bowl (we did our own bread bowl dip).  We needed to order ahead of time because we wanted the large loaves, but the price again was extremely reasonable, especially for fresh, local, delicious and *large* loaves.  

Did I mention they're open 24 hours to satisfy your cravings any time of day or night?  :-). A Humane Society store at the Biltmore?  Interesting.  I had seen an adorable chihuahua mix at the Humane Society's webpage, and headed over to check out the little dog and the store.  They sell a variety of toys, treats, leashes, collars, and foods- in short, they sell a little bit of everything.  There's no tax, and if you adopt a pet from them they will give you 10% off the price as a thank you.  When I went there were 4 dogs up for adoption, a rabbit, and a wall of cats.  The little chihuahua mix was hanging out in the store with another little dog, so we got to play with them for a little bit.  The staff were friendly, and weren't pushy or hovering.  

In the end, we did end up adopting that little chihuahua mix from here.  He's the sweetest little dog ever.  Thank you Petique!. Always clean, in and out, professionally managed. Easy to pay. Shaded dry area. Vacs nice and strong. 
Good for a quickie! 
Thanks!. Quite possibly the best bar food I have ever eaten. 

Cod tacos? Bacon and cheese burger? HOLY MOLY. 
The burger was, by far, my favourite... ever.

Bar food prices for amazing quality, I was very impressed. The service was great, our servers were helpful and so kind. The bar wasn't too packed, but pleasantly active. 

I will definitely be coming back for more!. Delicious popcorn! So many flavors to choose from! If you have to get a gift  for someone, this is unique! Boss's Day, Teacher's Day, Secretary's Day, Valentine's Day, Holiday gifts for the person you know little about or the person who has everything! Sport tins to choose from, or little bags that fit into gift boxes. Add some sweet taffy and well la! You are a thoughtful gift giver!. Any bar that can spin Neil Young with electronica has my vote. The gin cocktails are fantastic, the place is always packed at night and the service is top notch even though the place was bursting at the seams. This is definitely the place to be when it's cold out and it's not too full of hipsters, thank god.. The brunch has delicious options!  Be warned the portions are large. I don't expect to take leftovers from breakfast but that has happened. We have learned though it's best to order just one breakfast meal and add 2 eggs then it is a meal filling enough for 2 people.  Our savory suggestion is the crazy biscuits it is so good because one biscuit is covered with a white sausage traditional gravy but the other one is covered in a green pork chili they are both really good. The second suggestion for the sweet side is the bacon and blue pancakes deelicious!  Or if you can't decide which pancake you can get the option where you pick to 2 different pancakes.   They have wonderful syrup.  The the only downside is there's usually a wait.. I have eaten here a few times and pretty good. The best item hands down is the bacon appetizer... It's a must have. The only thing better is as dessert with ice cream! We got a few appetizers and were good. The ravioli were a little disappointing, just not a ton of flavor. But not bad by any means. Overall I would go back, service is always great.. Hands down the BEST dentist I've had! I knew from my very first visit which was very unexpected/emergency visit, that Dr. Waldman would be MY dentist. He's amazing and Jessie his hygienist is just as amazing!!! I heart them :-) They are extremely professional, thorough, clean and comforting. Yet, so fun and personable. They go above and beyond to make sure IM okay. They work with my budget and I have options! I always have options!! The whole team is fabulous and I would not recommend going anywhere else!!! Gahhhh love them all!!!. Went to dinner for my birthday.  We had a small group of 4 people and we all had a great experience. Our server knew the menu and details of each item. Even knew where it came from and exactly how it's prepared. She was attentive but allowed us plenty of time to enjoy the evening. Food was amazing. Would recommend to anyone for a nice dinner.. This Fry's is wonderful. Always great stock of fresh food, produce, everything. We never have to wait in line more than a minute. There are always lanes open and moving fast with friendly staff to meet you when you get there. We shop at this Frys every week and wouldn't go anywhere else. Especially Walmart here!! 

The only drawback to this location is it is PACKED. If you find a parking space, get it and go in because it's wall to wall filled most days.. If you like things overdone, then the Cheesecake Factory is for you.

The menu is HUGE.  The positive is that it offers tons of choices so even the pickiest eater can find something.  The downside is that it can be very difficult to choose unless you are in the mood for something in particular. 

This location has a large seating area and also offers outdoor patio seating.  We went on a Thursday evening and were able to be seated right away.  

Service was friendly and efficient.  She was attentive but not intrusive.   

We tried the Buffalo Bites and the fried macaroni and cheese.  The Buffalo Bites were more than enough for a meal by themselves.  There were a lot of them there.  The flavor is spicy but not over the top.  One of my favorite items on the menu.  We also tried the macaroni and cheese balls.  They were tasty and although it doesn't seem like a lot (especially compared to the number of buffalo blasts) they are filling and worth ordering.

Entrees were pasta and the chicken bam bam.  Both portions were HUGE and enough to serve at least two or three people.  The positive on that was leftovers for two additional meals.  Both were flavorful and we would order both of them again.  

Not that either of us had the room for it, but we both ordered cheesecake.  I went for the red velvet cheesecake and my husband ordered the cherry cheesecake.  Topped with a generous dash of whipped cream, the size of the pieces was substantial (as they should be for $7 a slice).  They were tasty and stood up well to being eaten several days later as part of our leftovers.

I was disappointed they discontinued the salted carmel pretzel drink, but other than that, this was a top notch visit to the Cheesecake Factory.. I used to go to the 24hr when I lived in Cali. The place was a total meat market and was a little skeptical when looking into this one. Luckily my concerns were put to rest when I walked into the place. When I entered the girl at the front desk was very nice and set me up immediately with a person to talk to. The guy showed me around the facilities. He was polite but seemed like he was just going through the motions. I decided to try to make conversation with him and he seemed to loosen up a bit. We went through the paperwork and he asked me if I had any questions. He answered all of them as best as he could and even looked into the other facilities to see if they offered what I was looking for. 

The facility is clean and well organized. The locker rooms are well kempt and the place doesn't smell like a dirty gym socks soaked in b.o. which is a plus. There are always plenty of machines. As long as you avoid the 4-7pm after work crowd you'll never have to wait. 

Overall it's been a good experience. It would be worth your time to at least print out the 7 day free pass and try it out. You might be pleasantly surprised :). Great chinese food.  This restaurant is fast, without sacrificing quality.  We are always well taken care of when we come in, or call for take out.  We have had the emperors chicken, sesame chicken, orange chicken, and egg drop soup.  All are winners!. I discovered I-naba maybe in May of 2013, not quite sure the exact date but nevertheless, I love this place.  

Every time I am in Vegas I have to come eat here.  

5 stars for the food.  I love their soba, it's delicious whether you get it hot or cold and their udon is good too.  I mean who doesn't love a good soupy dish when you're nursing a Vegas hangover?  Their salads that they give you before the meal is really good too.  I love the sesame dressing and unlike other Japanese places, all the times I have been here the lettuce was never wilted and the salad was always fresh.  You know when you go into a restaurant you can obviously tell when their salads been sitting there and they try to cover it up with dressing?  Yeah, never at I-naba.  Their combination specialities that they have on a separate  piece of paper when they give you the menu  are probably your best choice.  It comes with salad, choice of udon or soba, hot or cold and an entree.  

So far I haven't had anything bad here.  I love it and force everyone that comes with me to Vegas to eat here.. Vegas experience is incomplete without a Fat Tuesday. I was told this was one of those things I HAD to get, and it totally is.. All of my experiences here have been amazing. Fast and professional waxers. This establishment is always clean and the prices are great as well!. I finally made the great Breakfast pilgrimage.  It was worth every minute of the wait.  We put in our names, and walked over to the downtown market to kill some time.  We still had to wait about 15 minutes after that, but it was a great way to go.  Highly suggest it.  

The best pancakes I've ever had.  Ever.  And the home fries?  I could eat just a big bowl of that and be happy.  Great rosemary taste.  Really loved the coffee. Yummy peppery bacon.  One of our companions said the ham was the best she'd had since she's lived in Tennessee more than 15 years ago.  

Right before we left, we saw someone served a hamburger and we could hardly move.  It was the best looking burger I've ever seen.  We will TOTALLY be back just for lunch. Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmmm...  

But Matt himself cracking jokes with the patrons and chatting with downtown neighbors walking by was awesome.  While the food felt made with love, the big guy's personality totally put it over the top. You love supporting him supporting downtown.  Its the kind of business you would almost like to go even if it wasn't that good.  But thank goodness - it is that good.  Can't wait to go back.  

Very.  Very.  Soon.. Absolutely delighted with the service from Sterling Plumbing.  Mike and Nick were professional, courteous, and thorough replacing my tub.  I couldn't ask for a better resolution.  I've already recommended Sterling to my neighbor and will continue to recommend the company whenever possible.  Excellent job!. Awesome food!  I got the Truffled Cheeseburger, and it was possibly the best burger I have had!  My husband got a miniburger sushi combo, and he was impressed by both, and will order the sushi roll again.  Best sweet potato fries i have had anywhere, and the Tomagoshi shrimp were very tasty!. Beautiful new Spring Training home for the Cubs. 

 My friends who are Cubs fan and go to Wrigley field say Chicago dogs are amazing and are always talking about them.  Finally got to try one and loved it!

Beer and food is a bit pricey but aren't they usually at any athletic facility? Tailgate/eat/drink before you enter the park .

And The District and Toby Keith's I love this bar & grill offer shuttle service to and from the game. Might be a way to avoid the $7 parking fee and the post game traffic.

Make sure to bring sunscreen, sunblock, sunglasses and a hat if sitting in the lawn.. Just returned from a fabulous dinner to celebrate our anniversary and my birthday. Manager Todd and server Nils and the entire staff went out of their way to make our evening special and surprise us, including working with our relatives back East. The short ribs were succulent and tasty while the scallops were the best we have had in town.  Try the chocolate cake and creme brûlée for dessert. It was made to share. Waverlys never disappoints and always surprises with their attention to detail. It is one of our regular haunts and we will be back. Thank you.  Ask for a booth with Frederick or Nils.. I do not often write reviews but I have to agree with everyone on yelp.  They are definitely the best!  I found Gustavo on yelp and he came to the rescue!  We had flooded our tub and the water went into the carpets, which we tried as best we could to get the water out with towels.  At the end of the day, it was still wet and the next day, there started to have an odor.  Another carpet company recommended replacement, but Gustavo came, took it out, dried out the padding and replaced the carpet and cleaned it, leaving it looking like new!!!! You will not regret calling Carepro for all your carpet needs!!!!. The cracked egg is my favorite new breakfast spot. I love all the options, you can order just about any egg plate your mind can think up. I love the southwestern green chili scrambles. Their daily complimentary coffee cake is amazing, I especially love the peach.. Ok. Going to update my previous review. Just came back from a Vegas trip. Flew out from Ohare 02/02/14 at 15:40. Flew out on time. Flew back to Ohare at 09:15 02/04/14 (Vegas time) without any problems (AND we were expecting a snow storm in Chicago at around the time we were expected to land). Again, no problems. No delays. Even got to Chicago an extra 15 mins early! 

About the prices...people reviewing on here are crying about the added fees (i.e. Carry on luggage, seat assignments, food and beverage). IT IS ALL OVER THEIR WEBPAGE BEFORE YOU CLICK TO CONFIRM!!!!! 
Upset about the price of food and beverage? Get yourself a damn combo meal at McDonald's before boarding and QUIT CRYING!
I flew out as the Superbowl was happening and the pilot was even giving updates about the score. 
Do the research. Even with all the add ons, you will still save yourself $100s! 
Spirit, you will always have a happy customer flying with you!. Very good food, first time here. Had breakfast. Best gravy we've ever had. Food was awesome, service was awesome. Will definitely come back, will probably become regulars and highly recommend this place.. It's hard to get excited about an airport, but I really have no problems with YUL.  Personally, I prefer it to YYZ, which is the only other Canadian airport I've visited.  Free wifi, which is more than I can say for most of the other airports I frequent.

I've been to Montréal on two business trips now, so I've spent approximately six hours chillin at YUL, allowing an hour for the two times I arrived, and two hours for both departures. The four or so hours I waited for departing flights to LGA or JFK were spent in the transborder area off the main terminal, and if I'm really being honest, they were all spent watching sports and drinking beer at Le Bar Sportif.

The beer selection here is not amazing by any stretch, but generally they'll have one or two local microbrews on tap.  Score!  The televisions here are huge and plentiful, showing basically all the sports games in the world that you can possibly imagine.  This place smells a little like sour soap.  Like maybe all the rags they use to wipe the bar and tabletops had gone bad.  Or maybe it's something in the drains or the sink.  Eh, they've got beer, though.  What's truly amazeballs is that they'll pour you a beer or mixed drink in a to-go cup for you to take on your flight.  I carried on a rum and coke on my last flight.

The food at Le Bar Sportif looks absolutely disgusting.  Nothing at all vegetarian.  However, there's a little sandwich cart just outside that sells pretty rock 'em sock 'em sandwiches, including the veg one I had with roasted red peppers, goat cheese, spinach, and pesto.

All of my trips through YUL have been smooth and easy.  The signage is all accurate and straightforward, the place is clean, the WCs are plentiful, and the staff are friendlier than in some other airports up north (I'm from the southern US where we're known for our friendliness).  And there's someone watching the luggage screening area, helping you put your stuff on the belt wrong-side up (I got yelled at at YYZ for putting my luggage zipper side up on the belt, although there were no signs or anyone helping, etc.).  So, yeah, as far as airports go, this one is solid.. Great night life ..music and  atmosphere are off the hook! this is why its Vegas baby!. If you have a chance to upgrade to their Prestige Floors, then do it!  Yeah sure you pay a little extra, but my hubby and I loved it!  It was nice to feel spoiled!  With the Prestige you can enjoy perks such as:

My hubby and I loved the fact that we had our own private front desk area on the 23rd floor and did not have to go down stairs and wait in line to make changes in our reservation or to check out.  It was really nice and convenient.  We also loved the fact that we got endless cocktails which we could enjoy at the Prestige Lounge on the 23rd floor or we could take them down to our suite to enjoy.  Breakfasts were pretty decent and the cocktail reception always had different items on their menu daily.  We particularly loved relaxing at the lounge and sitting in the chairs by the windows which overlooked the Vegas Strip. Bathrooms at the Prestige Lounge were very clean and offered patrons mini bottles of Scope mouth rinse, I guess so you can get rid of the alcohol on your breath.  LOL!

As for our room, we stayed in their Siena Suite (24-705).  We absolutely loved it.  It was 1200-1300 sq ft in size and had two bathrooms and a separate living room and bedroom. It was well kept and clean. I loved the openness of the suite and the view of the mountains and Wynn Pools.  My hubby and I love the Siena suites!!!!. In order to retain my highly favored status with God, I'm going to give Elevation a 5 star review. Know it's really a 4.2, but I give extra credit for the good deeds. My experience here was extremely positive. There was plenty of parking on site and the facilities are shiny and new, which is an added bonus. As far as the service goes, if you haven't been to elevation before all I can say is you have to be ready for the Elevation Experience. 

Upon entering their property you WILL be greeted with a smile and feel welcomed. Volunteers line up at the entrance to form a hall of people that you go down. Everyone will smile and many will say "welcome". If you don't feel welcomed at Elevation, it is certainly not due to a WHOLE Hearted effort on behalf of the team. Think of the line that's formed by a basketball team when the starting lineup is being call, where you slap hands with folks on both sides. If the spirit moves you, run down and high five everyone. I'm sure no on will mind. It's good that they want you to feel excited going into church. That is only the beginning of the elevation experience.

Next up, going into the sanctuary. Not sure if they call it that, but you get the point. You will be ushered to a seat. When I was there, we did not get to choose our seat. The positive thing about this is that with every seat filled, there isn't all of that scooting down and crossing over folks with latecomers. The negative is that you have to step out of your comfort zone and make a request if you want to sit elsewhere in the event you know you have to leave early for whatever reason.

Service starts with praise and worship. Listen to me because this is very important. The music is LOUD. I repeat: THE MUSIC IS LOUD. The decibel level rivals that of a rock concert and that's because what you are experiencing is a Christian Rock concert Every single Sunday. The band gives their all. You can always ask for earplugs. I have to when I visit because it's too much for my ears. The ushers have them handy.

Then there's my favorite part of the service, the sermon. Pastor Steven is a great orator and man of God. His messages are usually 30 minutes. He is not live at this location, so you'll be watching the sermon on a screen. That's a visit to elevation in a nutshell. I'm leaving out some details such as the VIP experience because I'm tired of writing. However I will say that this church is doing great things in the community in serving God and regardless of your beliefs or preferences for church styles, you cannot knock that. Lots of folks getting saved and baptized here. That being said, if you're looking for a church, give Elevation a try.. Great service and great hobby!

Drones Plus is an authorized DJI dealer.  DJI is a great drone product.  
Definitely a fun hobby to get take up.  Service here has been excellent every time we stopped in.  Randal and Mike were both helpful and professional.  They were quite knowledgeable of the products.  

The store is definitely clean.  There aren't too many options on the display tables but I guess you only stop in this store for one thing.  

My husband is one happy shopper which makes me smile.  Do you want a new hobby?  It's definitely a fun one!. SUPER great food. We were in town for Spring Training and stopped by multiple times just because it's AMAZING! I loved everything but especially loved the roasted vegetable thin-crust pizza with nut (vegan) cheese. It absolutely hit the spot. The ambiance is very relaxing, the starters and wraps are great... what can I say? If I lived in Arizona (ANYWHERE in Arizona!) I would come here weekly. But for now I just have to wait until next Spring :). Stopped in for a quick drink & instantly fell in love with the place. Loved how they had fresh ingredients. I can't remember the name of my drink (it had kale, cucumber, ginger, etc) but I loved it - very refreshing! (Although I think it would be an acquired taste for most - a little too much green ingredients for some?). The Pomegranate Ginger cider was really good too. I took a peak at what people were ordering for their meals - it looked pretty good & their menu sounded promising.. Had so much fun last month we had to return. We were upgraded to a suite which was nice...although my hubby's blackjack losses more than covered the upgrade I'm sure. :) Everything was perfect as always and we are already planning our next stay.. I've been very sick lately & eating Thai food really hits the spot. This is my second time at Pinkaow & I got take out this time. My takeout was ready when I got there. Food is flawless, no complaints about this place. 
Staff is extremely friendly. Thanks guys! Will be returning :). I've been her twice now and both visits were wonderful. We have tried most of the menu, everything is so great. I love the yakitori items. Service is about the best in town.. When my husband and I moved to South Phoenix from the Bay Area, we were used to having Asian food three or four times a week. In an average month, we'd get Thai takeout five or six times, have Chinese delivered, enjoy Vietnamese for a casual lunch, fill up on dim sum on a weekend morning, and splurge on tons of sushi and grilled fish/meat at a Japanese restaurant. 

Needless to say, since moving to south Phoenix, we haven't had Asian food with nearly as much frequency. Although we have found some great Asian restaurants outside of our area, our options within a 10-15 minute range have been limited to Canton Wong #8 (a good but standard to-go Chinese joint) and Sun Asian Kitchen (a Chinese restaurant that bills itself as fine dining but is low on taste and quality). 

Enter Pan Asia Sushi Chinese Fusion, which just opened this past week in the new center on the southeast corner of 24th and Baseline. We've been eagerly anticipating its opening but were afraid to get too excited. After all, it could have just as easily turned out as bad as Sun Kitchen. Based on the very generic name, we also feared that it might be some sort of buffet (as if we don't already have enough of those in this area!). Well, we tried the restaurant last night, and it totally blew us away! 

The place definitely has some kinks to work out - the timing of food service was a bit off (we got our Chinese entree before our sushi), the communication between the bus boys and the servers was a little off, and the menu was a little confusing - but the decor is thoughtful and attractive (we especially loved the crystal light fixtures and the patterned wash basins in the bathrooms), the employees are friendly, and most importantly, the food is freaking incredible! 

For our main dish, we ordered the Mongolian Beef ($9) off of the Chinese menu. Even though they had some much more interesting dishes (one that stood out was the Crispy Beef with Plum Sauce), we like to start with something simple so that we can determine whether the ingredients used are fresh. Well, Pan Asia passed the test on that count! The beef was literally the best quality beef I've ever had in a Chinese dish - it was tender and super-flavorful. We were left wondering if they used filet! The vegetables were also bright and fresh. Best of all, the brown sauce was spicy - it's rare for a Chinese place to have a brown sauce be spicy by default, but we loved the kick and appreciated that they didn't dumb the dish down for an Americanized palatte. 

As if the entree weren't good enough, our three sushi orders (Las Vegas Roll, Philadelphia Roll, and the Yama Roll) were made with fresh and high-quality fish, well-rolled (a lot of places don't bother to actually roll the rolls well!), and artfully presented. We especially loved the unexpected touches on the dishes - swirls of eel sauce, dots of mango puree, and thinly sliced scallions. If you're not into the sweeter, fancier rolls, you may want to avoid these rolls and stick with some of the basics on the menu (they have a large nigiri/sashimi section, as well as some simple/more traditional rolls), but we really enjoyed the more inventive rolls, and from the freshness of the ingredients in the rolls we ordered, I imagine that the simpler, more fish-focused sushi items would also be really enjoyable. 

We are so glad that this place opened in our area - now we can go to one spot and get both high-quality Chinese and sushi! This combination may prove useful for groups or couples with varying tastes. According to our server, a liquor license is coming soon. Since we love cocktails just as much as we love good Chinese and sushi, that's great news! In the meantime, though, we'll definitely be back as often as possible. Pan Asia isn't just good for the area - it's just plain good!. We ordered a few things, a savory crepe from the specials, red velvet pancakes and kalua pig benedict from the regular menu/ The special wasn't too special, but the pancakes and benedicts were the BEST! The red velvet pancakes were very rich and the cream cheese syrup went perfect together! Though it was quite crowded on the weekend, it was worth it! MMM I may just head there right now.... We used a deal chicken which was a very good value as the menu items vary from 15-33 dollars.  Rather expensive for a Mexican restaurant.  We had a wonderful reception when we arrived. We were greeted by two different people.  Seating was timely and very pleasant.  Our waiter came immediately to our tables, got us started on our Margaritas and brought the included Fundido appetizer which was very good.  Contrary to other reviewers we did get a basket of chips and salsa as well as fresh tortillas within a few minutes of being seated.  The Margaritas are big and really good.  Again, to get 2 each was a great deal.  Our waiter, Trent, was very pleasant, efficient and nice.  No bad attitude about the deal chicken voucher.  I had the taco plate, shrimp, beef and chicken served with beans, rice and 3 more tortillas.  Good but a lot to eat!  My daughter had a spicy chicken dish, she really liked it but, like me, said it was too much food.  It seems the reviews here are based on the poor service as opposed to the quality of food but I have to give the establishment 5 stars because I can't fault to service in the least.  They really went out of their way to make sure we had a good time.  We sat inside, too hot outside, but there were 20 or more people enjoying the evening on the beautiful patio under the mister system.  Would I go back?  Yes, with a deal chicken.  Had we paid full price the dinner would have been over $100 total  including the drinks which to me is too pricy for a Mexican restaurant.. We were going to a Cirque du Soleil show and came across BLT Burger. The service was a bit slow, but the burger and milkshake were great! I had a Tex Mex burger with a vanilla/Oreo milkshake. Highly recommend both! I would definitely go back!. I love this place!!! All of the drinks that I've had there so far are awesome, and all of the flavors are pretty interesting. Yes, they are very sugary, but that's not really a bad thing. I would say try the Thai Tea if you're new to bubble tea. Yummmmmmm. My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary. Everything was wonderful and the food was great. We were even seated outside as requested; though, we had to go back inside because our table was infested by little bugs coming from the bush next to it. The inside was just as nice. As you may read from the previous comments, the decor is beautiful and gives a nice, fresh, contemporary vibe. 

We had the caramelized onion flatbread, prime tenderloin and for dessert, banana, chocolate and peanut butter cream pie. Everything was delicious and cooked very well!

Service was good; however, we asked for a top-off for coffee after the server took our payment, but the server never came back. That was a little disappointing. Other than that, everything was great!. I'm not downtown often but some friends mentioned I had to try this place! A group of friends and I went for happy hour on the grand opening. Collectively we tried the Matilda beer& Pinot Gris to drink. The flatbread and fried cheese for the appetizers. Which I would definitely order again.They had complementary chips that were really good. We tried the fried chicken, airline chicken, risotto, fried rice and cauliflower for entrees which were all amazing. We also got the fried wedges, a soup and drunken noodles to try which I don't think I'd order again but it's always fun to try something new and unique. For dessert we had a blue berry scone, a mixed berry muffin, brownie cookies, biscotti, and Bombay brownies! Delicious! Enough said. Drinks were very affordable. Conveniently located on Fremont near all the casinos. We got here a little too late so the DJ had finished playing. LAME! We did order drinks and prices were cheap. Clean bathrooms even at the end of the night. Reminded me a lot of LA's Griffin except a lot smaller.. Delicious. Fresh. Not greasy. Yummmmy.

You know how some mexican food places have great tasting food, but its really greasy? This is not that kind of food. The food here is fresh, tasty, it's just so beyond your average taco joint. Fish tacos are great, tacos dorados are excellent, chicken taco, carne asada taco are good.  Comfortable place to eat with plenty of booths. You order your food at the counter, pay at the counter, and pick it up at the counter.. I've given up my high-maintenance nails and went in to have them removed today.  The shop has new owners...they have redecorated and the place is much cleaner and more welcoming.  I've met the owners and it's clear that they understand and appreciate customer service.  They are both very nice and intent on making sure their clients are satisfied..  If you give them a visit, you'll be impressed by the pricing and expertise.  I'm a big fan of Julie and Jessica and  they always do a great job for me.  Give them a shot!. great service but the lunch I ordered we so so. Heeeere's Johnny's! With a menu that is virtually the same as Lobby's, Johnny's serves up the same high quality, superb Chicago style eats. I think the only differences in the menu are the additions of salads and the slightly different buns for the burgers. 

We stepped in and ordered a mushroom burger, vanilla shake, fries, and Italian beef. The burger was a heavenly concoction of juicy, well seasoned beef, crisp lettuce, sliced tomato, red onion, with flavorful sauteed mushrooms. The sesame bun it was on was lightly toasted and provided some nice texture balance with the sesame seeds, slight crispness around the bun's edges, and the soft bun itself. The Italian beef is as good as ever, with the broth soaked bun, expertly flavored, thinly sliced beef, and added toppings (We added hot peppers and onions). Oh so good. 

The shake was creamy, thick, and delicious, and the fries were crinkle cut and crispy. Service was excellent and we were greeted with a smile by the cook and Johnny, who was manning the front when we were here. He even came by during our meal to ask if everything was OK, and thanked us for coming when we left.

Here's hoping Johnny's is here to stay for a very long time!. Love this place!!  I like their taro with boba snoh the best, and you can go wrong with any of the glazes.  Some of the snohs are really sweet so you have to be careful to pair them with less sweet toppings unless you have an intense sweet tooth.  I've only had their boba once but it was fantastic.  Recently I went with a big group of people that were not familiar with the flavors and they stayed with safe things (fruit snoh with chocolate toppings) but they also loved it.  

In addition, workers are always friendly and helpful, and most will give you samples if they have time.  They play cool indie music usually, have cool art on the walls and have a nice artsy nerd vibe. They have Jenga and some other games, so it's a nice place to just chill and eat/drink something delicious.. This was my first time! Great place love how my nails came out! They were friendly and helpful!. I've been going here most of my life and it will forever be my favorite place for breakfast. Every menu item is delicious and the staff is consistently pleasant, quick, and correct! The owners are kind and remember their regulars. There's a reason this restaurant has been around for so long...don't skip out on this gem! It's an east valley essential! 

My favorites: passion fruit tea, the greek fetash (reduced portion...2 eggs instead of 3?), their homemade jam on the English muffins or a honey bran muffin in place of the English muffin!. Did you know that Ten is owned by SRG?  Sapporo Restaurant Group... you will notice the similarities in the restaurants if you've been to both.

Ten Sushi Asian Fusion is the full name of this restaurant... and that is exactly what they have to offer.  I've been on several occasions to dine in and I've also picked up food for 'take-out.'  As Josh said almost a year ago, the service can sometimes be disappointing.  However, if you get a good waiter / waitress, you'll have a great experience.  Minus one star for the gamble...

On to the food...
First, if you are watching your spending, you may want to take advantage of Ten's daily happy hour from 4p - 7p.  They offer deals on drinks, sushi, and appetizers.

I recommend starting with lobster dumplings - steamed just right and served with a yummy dipping sauce.  However, Ten offers regular edamame and spicy edamame too - I'd never seen this before!  Their house salad with ginger dressing and their seaweed salad are pretty similar to what you might order at any other sushi restaurant.

If you're making a meal of sushi, there is plenty to choose from... I love the Ten roll  and spicy scallop handroll, but I'm sure there is something for everyone... 

If you choose to go with the asian/fusion selections, I will recommend the KABAYAKI SCALLOPS.  The dish has not let me down and the scallops are prepared in a wok with fresh asparagus and shitake mushrooms.  For the health conscious, you can choose from white or brown rice!

There are plenty of vegetarian options and a special 'ten and under' portion of the menu if you bring the kiddies!  This is a good place for groups and I've never had to wait for a table here either!. Yes! Go here!!! Free to enter Calton hill but to climb the monument you will have to drop £4. You get a certificate stating you climbed all of the stairs and such. 
It provides an awesome view of edi. 
I enjoyed this one as much as I enjoyed Scott's Monument. 
Very friendly woman at desk and the little museum at the bottom was pretty interesting giving the history of Nelsons monument. . 
Go to Calton hill or watch from princes street. At 12.50-12.55p the ball raises to the top and drops at 1p. It was designed for the men on the ships to see time since it traveled faster than the speed of sound (the castle canon). 
Very interesting and worth it!
Bring camera and walking shoes.. Okay, when you're paying less than 10 dollars for two traditional rolls, you can't expect top shelf seafood so please, lower your expectations fast.

That being said, Sushi Express is generously priced and the rolls are amazing considering the price.

I've had a pleasant experience eating in and ordering carry out from Sushi Express. I know some people have mentioned poor delivery services so maybe instead of having it delivered, pick it up yourself the next time you have a hankering for super cheap sushi.. I love this store. It's colorful, warm and inviting. They have food, wine, soda, bracelets, furniture, etc. I could literally spend several hours here.

Yesterday we stopped by hoping to find a non-traditional coffee table. We walked out with chipotle chocolate, silverware, ice cube trays and a bench that we are using as a coffee table. Their prices are very reasonable, I think they could charge more and people would still shop there.

Did I mention that I love this store?. I had a great breakfast with my husband! The coffee was awesome, the omelette see ordered came out fast and the service was great! Everyone was friendly and personable. I would recommend this restaurant to all my friends going to Vegas.. Guys, I totally wanted to give this place 5 stars.  Heck, yelpers are ranting and raving about how awesome this place is.  However, I had to peel a star off.  Here's why.
First of all, we walked in and guys were screaming at each other.  Literally, being completely obnoxious. They continued to do that while the chefs and owner looked on with disgust.
Anyways, food wise, takowasa, awesome (better than Honda-Ya's), sea urchin custard (wow) and everything else was ok.  Honda-Ya has better yakitori.  
I recommend going with a big group.  It is absolutely not a date place.. Everything is so delicious! I ate here twice, while I was in Vegas. The waiters are alright, but overall, the food is good and decent priced!. Best brunch place in Las Vegas!!  Food is always tasty and I have tried almost everything on the menu. Service is great - always friendly and happy to help. This is a must go to restaurant!. This restaurant is awesome!  We couldn't figure out where to eat, and decided to give this place a try.  This is one of the decently priced restaurants in the venetian.  

I had the mediterrainean mahi mahi. So filling and absolutely delicious.   My husband had the filet with carrots.  Wow!!  An amazing filet for 30$ on the strip!!  

Seriously cannot say enough good things about this place.  The ladies sitting at the table next to us had fantastic things to say about it too!!

We will be back several times....for sure!  Way to go Grand Luxe Cafe!!. i love putters! my friends in vegas live right next to this bar so we come here often. its more of a locals bar so the bartenders are super fun and friendly. if you tip them well they will hook it up and take care of you :). Love this place, been coming here for years. Food is fabulous and the price is right. We've actually gotten to know Moon, who now gives us hugs when we walk in the door.. I stopped in to witness the Chamber of Commerce ribbon cutting with Mayor Hafen and was pleased to get a quick tour with the manager. I was impressed with the decor which is very upscale for a poker bar! Lots of great touches such as photos from days gone by of Henderson and the coolest restroom signage! 
There is the standard poker bar (smoking permitted) with a cool lighted tree and a large dining room. They have a promo of $20 play when you earn 100 points on their players' card. 
The dining room has a garage type door that separates seating areas and can be closed depending on the atmosphere. One seating area has funky black "furry" benches that stood out. 
The menu includes standard lounge fare and the sliders were so tasty! Much better than I anticipated and better than a competing poker bar chain which also has initials in its name!
With food like that, this second location should have no problem securing a place in the Eastern corridor/Gateway to Anthem lounge scene!. Business trip=loser, trying amazing restaurants while on a business trip=WINNER! This place was beyond outstanding! 

First this is not Mexican food, which I was glad about because really, I live next door to Costa Mexico (Mesa) so I don't need to fly to Arizona to eat Mexican. But I will fly to Arizona to have this amazing food from New Mexico! In fact I may move here to eat this food, this is how much I loved ever single bite.

I had a margarita and loved it. I ordered a plate that had the chili relleno, tamale, enchilada and rice and beans on it. I never, ever order chili rellenos but this woman next to us kept raving about it so I figured if I got it as part of a combo plate, I would not be stuck feeling sad I didn't order something else. My god I am so glad I listened to that big mouth customer; it was the best chili relleno I have ever had in my life.
I don't know what the boss ordered but whatever it was, I tried it and it was equally outstanding.

The boss and I tried to quit eating when we were full and we could not so we rolled out of the restaurant, down the tarmac and flew back home in our food comas and lived to tell about it.... This is my new favorite pedicure spot! The inside is gorgeous and so relaxing. I walked in and was seated for a pedicure right away. Prices are reasonable, great massage and very clean!. After a lifetime of terrible experiences with tire stores, I give this an A+!

I went in with my request for two front tires, and that's what the salesperson sold me. He didn't try to oversell me on things I didn't need, or try any such tactics. He reviewed the pricing options with me and didn't pressure me on this either. 

The job was complete in the timeframe and pricing structure that was stated me.. This was one of the best massages that I have ever had!  My husband and I were walk ins and as soon as we got in we were taken to a room and sat in a comfy chair. The lights were dimmed and there was music playing. She showed us the options and I decided on a shoulder and foot massage and my husband got a foot, back and shoulder massage. The person who gave me my massage was Boweal. He started on my shoulders and asked if the amount of pressure was okay, it was a little to hard for me so he used less pressure. It was awesome!  I was super tense and at the end of my massage I was feeling great! The foot massage was the best! I actually fell asleep three times! We will be visiting again the next time we are in Vegas! We were both a little sore that evening and the next day but it was a good sore :) we highly recommend this place!!. I can't believe I have lived here over 2 years and just heard about this show.  My friend got tickets and I'll go just about anywhere for $5.  We got more than our monies worth!  If you live here and haven't seen this show, then I suggest getting to one.  Frankie is very talented, as well as his brother and the rest of the members.

What came across to me was how genuine and loving they all are.  It was quite touching and I am so glad to have gone.  I'll be taking guests when they are in town!. Dear Koi,

Thank you for understanding that I have shellfish allergies and I needed you to use a different knife when cutting my sushi. Thank you for your prompt service and coming to check on my Jager Bombs and Coronas every time I took the last sip. Thank you for understanding what really, really, really tasty food is. Thank you for your $20 unlimited alcoholic beverages in your night club, and allowing me a VIP pass after I ate at your restaurant to enjoy your club until wee hours into the morning. Thank you for playing fantastic music while in the club. Thank you for not being outrageously expensive, and reasonable. And lastly, Rock on. I will be visiting you every time I go to Vegas now.

Your biggest fan from California,
Ashley.. I love this place as does my shiba inu, Saki. The staff is so nice and remembers our names and just loves having Saki visit and run around the store. They have a great selection of treats, toys and food. Their prices are competitive with similar stores in Las Vegas. Recommend this store to all dog owners.. Went here on a Saturday night as an anniversary celebration dinner.  The meals we had here were superb.  From the lovely selection of bread, to our delectable appetizers, we started our meals off right.  I had the lobster with chorizo appetizer ($28), and my husband had the Caesar salad ($17).  The lobster was perfectly cooked and tender.  Strangely enough though, the chorizo was very mild and I couldn't really taste any typical chorizo flavor or spicy heat in it.  Maybe it was a more European version of chorizo?  My husband's Caesar salad came with a Scotch quail egg, which was perfectly crispy on the outside, yet light, with lots of flavor.

We had the beef Wellington for two ($100), which took some time to get served to us, but it was worth it!  I savored every bite of the beef, packed with flavor, and the flaky pastry crust with mushroom paste covering the inside.  

I decided to try the HK antioxidant cocktail ($14), which was smooth and refreshing.  The flavors were fruity and perfect together.

While I enjoyed the meal, service was off.  For such a fine establishment where you are paying a lot of money for your meal I really expect nothing but friendliness and attentiveness from the wait staff.  For the most part, this was true.  However, our main server seemed disinterested and wasn't very friendly throughout the whole meal.  When it came to ordering dessert, we were so stuffed we couldn't possibly eat any more, but really wanted to take something back to the hotel with us for later.  We asked for the sticky toffee pudding to go, and initially our server wouldn't let us order it, because the ice cream would melt, he said.  We told him that we were heading right to our hotel room afterwards and the room had a freezer.  After some discussion, he finally said he could pack it up to go, but without the ice cream.  Once again, our room had a freezer, so the ice cream wouldn't melt, but whatever, we were OK with eating it without ice cream.  Eating it later on, perhaps that ice cream would have helped cut the very sweet nature of the dessert, for it was almost cloyingly sweet for my tastes.

P.S.  If you have a Total Rewards casino card with any Harrah's-owned establishment, they give you a few dollars off each item you order, but if you pay with your rewards points, your total is based on the normal non-discount price.. this was my first las vegas buffet experience. crab, shrimp, tons of fresh veggies. I had no idea they were this good!. Love love love it here!!! Great service. All of the employees are genuinely nice and that always helps. I have recommended this place to many people now and come here every couple of weeks. Love it :). I love the ARC of TEMPE , I always find awesome trinkets and vintage frames at rock bottom prices ( go on Saturday or Sunday to get half off of EVERYTHING) They could be a bit more organized ( no Thrift Store odor thank goodness) but they have a wide selection, so go take a peek and leave with something neat. 

Another cool fact : 100% of the proceeds from The Arc Thrift Shop provide the majority of the funding for their Recreation Center for youth and adults with developmental disabilities , so shop for a GREAT cause.

My son and 2 of his friends who also stayed at this hotel had a taekwondo tournament the following day from our Initial stay, we asked an employee where we could go to get our last training session going, the guy gave us a conference room so our kids can kick and get ready for the next day WOW talk about going above and beyond Very pleased would love to stay again.. We are LGO frequenters and we watched as they built this place just across the street for a few months so I'm not sure why it has taken us this long to try it!

This past Sunday we met another couple for a late lunch around 2pm. Luckily there was plenty of parking spaces because as other regulars know, parking in this area during peak times can be a bit stressful. 

The inside is cute but pretty small with seats at the bar and only a few tables. Since it was beautiful outside, we decided to sit out on the patio and they definitely had more seating outside, though the gravel was a bit of an odd chose for patio flooring. When sitting outside, you order at the window on the north side of building and then take your number to your table where they deliver it.

I ordered the Ingo burger without the bun, with the yuzu berry iced tea. My fiance got the Paris Texas burger and the other couple both got the cheeseburger. We also shared an order of the shattered potato chips. The tea came in a bottle and was really good, it did taste more like a green tea though and I doubt there are free refills but I didn't ask. I probably would have ordered a Diet Coke in a can when I saw someone else with one but didn't see it on their menu, only a Coke with cane sugar so it would have been nice to have it listed. 

The cheeseburgers were delivered all at the same time and they were all really good. My fiance literally moaned every bite he took of his Texas burger. He said it was the best burger he's ever had. I had to try it after a comment like that and while good, I've had a few better so maybe he was just really hungry. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not the best ever in my opinion. The chips were really good and fresh and the accompanying dip was good too, different. 

One other note, several people brought their dogs. I am a HUGE dog lover and would typically be a fan of being able to bring your dogs to a patio but the seats are pretty close to each other and the couple next to us had a long leash and I definitely felt like the dog was part of our lunch. Not something I'm into at a restaurant. They did try and watch him but it's still interrupting when the dog barked at other dogs or  when others petted the dog, you could see the hair flying in the breeze...enough to make me worry about getting it on my food and that's pretty gross. 

All in all, I would come back here on a nice day and enjoy the patio and hope only shed free dogs were around.. Such great customer service! Mario walked me through cleaning my coils over the phone for $0! My refrigerator is working fabulously and it didn't cost me a cent. The other companies I called offered to come out the next day for a $65 diagnostic fee but never suggested I see how dirty my coils were! I'm a customer for life and Mario is in my phone. I'll never call anyone else!. Heard a ton about it and saw on anthony bourdain so had really high hopes. The service was excellent and although we had bar reservations they gave us a table instead which was nice. A downside is the impossible to read chalkboard menu which was behind me so either you have to awkwardly stand behind diners and stare at it or crane your neck 180degrees which is not comfortable at all. The bread was soooo good, best bread i can think of. The asparagus with egg and duck sausage was a great flavorful and rich appetizer and I was basically full after it but had already ordered the lamb which was succulent and fall off the bone. My boyfriend had the double down half which he did not think was the revelation everyone else seems to think. His lobster sausage was good but didn't blow his mind. Overall a hearty rich meal, came out to 120 with top which I guess isn't horrible but for no drinks or dessert is quite pricey!. I had my lashed done for the first time on Saturday and  Danyal was amazing!  She is incredibly warm and friendly and I was so relaxed that I slept through half the appointment!  My lashes turned out beautiful.  I am extremely pleased with my experience.  Thank you for doing such a wonderful job Danyal!. We had a group of 10, our waiter was great and the food was fantastic.   I will go back next time I'm in Vegas. My first visit here was a good experience. The wait-time is a bit long (an hour and 10 minutes) but once I was in, Dr Pardee answered all my skin care questions and gave me wonderful suggestions.. I usually run the other way when it comes to chain restaurants, but we've had a $50 gift card for P.F. Chang's that was given to us about six months ago and finally decided to bite the bullet.  I've been to the one on the Strip twice, but that was a long time ago, my only memory being grease, and more grease.  So I wasn't particularly looking forward to dinner tonight.  But 50 bucks is 50 bucks, so...

The economy must have gotten to PFC:  Saturday night and no wait for a table at 9:00 pm.  I settled on a glass of white zin (yeah, I know, Kool-Aid), and hubby ordered a Newcastle on draft.  I see-sawed between ordering a la carte, since the Spiced Lamb sounded interesting, and the 39.99 Four-Course dinner, until the waitress said that the Sesame Chicken on the dinner was really, really good.  So we went for it.

I was totally surprised.  The Hot & Sour Soup, while not overwhelmingly spicy, was delicious, not overly glutinous, and had a generous helping of both pork and tofu.  

The lettuce wraps were very good, and we were offered a second helping of lettuce, since the first batch didn't make a dent in the large portion of chicken and crispy rice noodles.  

By that time we were pretty full, so dinner tomorrow night will be our leftovers:  that excellent Sesame Chicken, and the Kung Pao Shrimp, which was terrific, but would have been even better if I ever could remember to have the kitchen NOT add any additional salt.  Even my husband enjoyed it, and he doesn't like shrimp!!  Best of all was the absence of the pools of grease that I remember from the Strip location.  There was even a lot less oil than we get at our usual New York Chinese Restaurant go-to, and the ambience is a lot nicer.

The Prix Fixe includes two desserts, and there are eight mini desserts to choose from, all served in shooter glasses.  I had the Lemon Tres Leche [sic], which didn't taste at all like the usual Tres Leches dessert, but was astoundingly good, so much so that the little shooter seemed much more dessert than I should be eating.  Hubby had the Apple Pie, and liked it a lot.  But mine was better!!

Our server, Nancy, was outstanding - everything a server should be:  friendly, helpful, patient, efficient, and accommodating.  

All in all, we had a terrific meal in an attractive place, and would have enjoyed it just as much if we actually had to pay for it!. Really outstanding crepes, scones, and coffee; friendly, helpful service; well-designed space with wonderful light.  I love that the food served is all fresh and local (and sourced on a chalkboard!).  

Public garage is right across the street, and there is a lot of metered (except Sundays) parking as well.

Good overview at http://www.thedailypage.com/daily/article.php?article=20902 .. Went there to get my brakes fixed and ended up getting more bad news about my car... I thought they might be trying to rip me off since I was a girl, but they showed me everything that was wrong with the car, showed me what things were suppose to look like which made me feel secure about what was going on with my car. After the breakdown on my car, they layed out the numbers for me! They were so nice they gave me a 10% discount and even helped me make a payment plan! Customer service was great and gave me a lot of extra little deals next time I want to come back and get more work done! I highly recommend this place, reliable, trust worthy, and very very nice! 5 stars for this place!. This could be my new favorite place to grab a drink and eat at the bar. There is something about eating at a bar that I really enjoy, and I loved the ambiance here. Had a groupon to use, my friend and I were dressed casual, when we arrived we felt slightly under dressed to sit in the dining area (I'm sure they wouldn't have mind but out of respect for the owners who were walking around) we decided to sit at the bar. It sat about 10-15 people, had two TV's, dark lighting with candle on the bar, a friendly bartender and a large wine list and specialty cocktail list. The bread basket was filled with soft, tasty bread and a side of oil AND vinegar (I appreciate it when balsamic is added to the olive oil). We ordered the prosciutto stuffed figs with arugula that went perfectly with my Sauvignon Blanc, it was delicious. The menu was extensive, filled with the usual Italian favorites, one in particular, cioppino, which I will come back to try. When the bill came, our bartender informed us that an 18% gratuity is automatically added to the bill PRIOR to the discount, which I don't think is a big deal like other people have complained about in other reviews, I'm sure it's to help prevent the cheap skates from not tipping properly. If you read your Groupon you would see prior to purchasing it, it states it plain and simple. Will definately return.. Outstanding!  Came to our house to replace & even put our parking sticker on the new window.. Stopped in this morning to grab a drink. There was a free drink with check-in offer which made things even better! I had a cup of their Christmas blend tea to-go. For this reason, I can't yet comment on the food, but the service was excellent. The baristas helped me pick out a tea and were very cheerful about everything as well. This place has a trendy yet accessible vibe, and I look forward to going back again soon for breakfast/brunch!. I honestly love this place! Not only do they have delicious drinks/desserts, but have a great service. If you're looking for a place to cool down, this is where you go!. Best buffet now in Vegas but don't like kiosk system for reservation you still have to wait in line and I just prefer to go when I choose and wait in long line.. Went there tonight, pretty busy on a Friday evening for dinner. We had to wait about 5 minutes to get a table for 8 of us but it was worth it. The food came out right away since 3 of us did all you can eat and the rest just had the combination plates. We ordered the 808 special roll and we liked it the best. Tried a little bit of everything on the appetizer menu and they were all tasty. Considering it was our first time there; we will definitely go back for more!. Good place to eat, I will recommend it to everyone , definitely going back to eat here... Brenda has been my nail tech for several years. She is one of the most creative nail techs that I have been to. I get compliments all the time about the designs on my nails. She uses quality products and is an all around great person. So pamper yourself and give Brenda a call!. Went with a group of friends for breakfast after a hard night of drinking (I think some of us were still drunk!). It was a Sunday morning and we were seated within 20min. The brought out complimentary french bread that was delicious! The order at our table: (2) Chicken & waffle, Sourdough Waffle w/Bananas and a side of crispy bacon, Corn-beef hash and the Bouchon French Toast. The Chicken (roasted) & waffle looked amazing and both friends that ordered it said it was! Gonna have to try that next time. The sourdough waffle was crispy, the corn beef hash was excellent (not greasy) the french toast had custard and apples and was amazing! Although very rich! The table next to us ordered the jar of smoked salmon served with croutons which I regretted not seeing on the menu. I have also heard great things about the salmon baguette, will have to try that next time as well!!!  For the quality of food, the brunch prices are very reasonable!. I'm the Volunteer Coordinator so I'm pretty biased...none the less, our team is amazing and we do whatever we can to help ANYONE in need. Come volunteer and see what we're all about!. Loved loved loved this show.  This guy is so funny, we laughed the whole show.  We had  a 15 and 13 year old with us, and they thought it was great.  I agree, he doesn't get the credit he deserves.  We thought he was way better than Criss Angel in so many ways. More entertaining, funny, better magic, and great sense of humor.  A must see!  We chose not to have our picture taken before the show, and now regret it.  There is a reason they take them, and it is funny, so do it!. Like others here I found Mr. Antenna and particularly Sabrina to be super helpful. When I was first considering cutting the cable cord she patiently answered all my questions, scheduled an appointment for antenna installation and we were set up in no time. Very happy with NO cable bill and over 50 channels. The HD was actually clearer and brighter than through Cox. After about six months we inexplicably lost reception of a favorite channel. I called and Sabrina came out, spent about an hour troubleshooting the problem and solved it. I can't praise her professionalism and customer service enough. I highly recommend dumping cable TV and contacting Mr Antenna.. Good selection of costumes for all ages. As long as you go a week before halloween there are hardly any lines & plenty of sizes. Prices are average for any costume store. A good go to for about any costume you can think of.. As we waited for our Brunch table to be ready at Coca Café, we wondered down the street to this cool little spot.  Since moving to the area, I've been dying to try it.  

I ordered a medium latte.  This was a substantial cup for a medium! I definitely wasn't complaining about it.  All I added was a wee bit of Splenda and it was perfect.  

The shop was almost at capacity on this Sunday afternoon.  Since I'm in the middle of studying for my CPA exam, I've been tempted to try this place out as a study spot.  This is the only reason I'm withholding that 5th star - just too busy and noisy to be able to study productively.  I'm glad I visited before I lugged my computer and books down the hill.  I'll be a regular at this place.. Great place to have a true fresh hamburger! You can tell they make there patties by hand! Very satisfied!. This is our new favorite since moving to Arizona in August. The atmosphere and location are good. The food is delicious. We have tried a few of the broths and they are all wonderful. The ingredients are fresh and there are lots of choices. Our favorites are the Shabu beef, the chicken and the spinach. The dumplings are the kids' favorite. Our only complaint is the staff seems overwhelmed at times. They might need more servers during busy times. We will be back soon!. Alyssa has been cutting my hair and my husband's for almost five years now. We love going to her. She is a wonderful person and does a great job! She is creative and knows what looks good on each of us. I highly recommend her. She also has a great reputation in the valley for her hair coloring!. Located in the Canal Shoppes of the Venetian, this Haagen-Dazs is a nice alternative to the fake gelato shops near it and does not have nearly the line. 

Good service and good selection of ice creams and sorbets. I went for one of the specialty sundaes - the Rocky Road Dazzler. They actually make it in a drink cup. Layers of Rocky Road ice cream, hot fudge, and whipped cream. So good. And don't think about the calories consumed. 

Takes credit cards.. I love this place!  Visited recently and had the Pesto Grilled Shrimp Salad - YUMM-O!  I've had several things off their menu over the years and everything is always fresh and flavorful.   If you go, you must save room for dessert!  Two words - Baby Cakes!!   If you can't eat dessert on your visit, buy some baked items to take home!  The granola is outstanding too!!

Atmosphere is charming - like visiting an old friends' home.  I can't wait for the weather to cool off because eating on their side patio area is adorable!  You really won't believe you are sitting in the heart of Scottsdale - like being in a villa in Tuscany!!  

There is a reason this place has been a Valley destination for "ladies who lunch" and just about anyone who has ever had or attended a shower (bridal or baby) has probably celebrated at least once at AF!  It seems like every weekend there is someone having a party here!  

Heard the waitress talking to another table that you can reserve use of the entire place for evening events!  Would be a sweet set up for a party - to have the entire place to yourself....like entertaining at home without all the clean up!  Nice!!. Tasty food and great service. All dishes were delicious. Our favourite dish is chicken 65. Bit costly. Can go occasionally and enjoy the food!. Went on the party bike this last weekend with some friends for a bachelorette party and had the best time! I did wake up with a sore butt from the bike seat, but I feel like that's my fault... I need to work on my technique.  We made several stops at good locations. I think you can request specific stops if they aren't too far away (this is a bike after all). 
Pedaling was really only required on small hills and after a stop, which I have to say was nice. I had feared that I would be tired out from all the pedaling which was not the case. 
We were also offered swag that included koozies and stickers which I took full advantage of:-)
Our driver Travis was the best!  He was a handsome devil that had good tips on how to maximize the time with the party bike and had a knack for picking out music that delighted us, as well as nearby pedestrians.. Wow garlic dip just like in Lebanon! Salmon fresh as can be! Family birthday party ,too. We were welcome even with three tiny ones. Service was great, food even better. We are repeat attenders. Healthiest menu and well prepared food. Friendly staff door to door!. Tried the chicken gyro, was pretty tasty.  Asked for a sample of lamb and was given a nice portion to taste for free, the lamb is delicious.   Prices are affordable and location is near my work, will come back.. This is a nice hotel. I just got back from veags last night and the trip wasnt paid for by me, so this is an honest to goodness review of the hotel itself.

They get four stars because of the staff. Otherwise, it would be three. (c'mon yelp, let us give half stars already!!) We stayed in the tower suites area of the hotel, which is the "VIP" section. there is a sepearate valet and check in area. There is also a private pool for the tower suite guests ( which after seeing all the pools at both Encore and Wynn) is nothing to write home to mom about. The best pool there was the european pool at the Encore which was filled with americans. The draw is that women can go topless if they want. EVERYONE had on a bikini top.  Weak!!! 

This is a 5 star hotel. One of four on the strip. (Wynn, Bellagio, and the Four Seasons) are the other three. Perhaps its just me, but 5 star means that NOTHING should fall through the cracks. We got room service the first night. Coffee, tea, and cookies. Thats it. $57. Thats crazy talk. That tea better be picked by the hand of Buddha, and Jesus better have made those cookies. DAMN!! The person who brought the table said he would send someone back in an hour to get the table. That table was there until the next day. Same thing the next night. No biggie, but if were VIP then wtf? If I was Mariah Carey, those tables woulda been gone asap.

The room was nice. View of the Encore Beach club which was empty the entire weekend. It costs $80 to get in if you're not a Wynn or Encore guest and $50 if you are. I'll just stick to the free pools thanks, although the ambiance of it from my window looked cool.  Bathroom was a marble delight. Super comfy beds. SUPER NICE valet and cleaning staff. Would i stay there again? Sure, on someone elses dime. On my dime, its ALL about the Palazzo hotel baby. See review for this one below..... Great service from the moment we stepped I in the door for dinner. Very attentive. Delicious food! We split the Brie appetizer, I had the famous onion soup and hubby loved the burger with the bacon and fried egg on it. We will definitely be returning!. Great place to hang out and watch Sunday Football.  Good food selection and excellent service.. The two times that I came here I have had a really good experience.They do a really neat and thorough job and my nails always turn out great. They will accommodate any requests for color/designs. Prices are reasonable as well.. Prompt friendly service is a must for me and El Palacio delivers. The chips with bean dip and salsa are yummy and my entrees flavorful. Great option if you want a sit down Mexican dinner.. i really enjoy this restuarant. but does anyone else miss bobby mcgees and its maze-like interior filled with would-be actors who honed their craft as servers? and there's nothing like scooping salad out of an oversized bathtub. that's all i'm saying.. Lavie Nails and Spa is always a welcoming place to go. They offer a variety of services including the new gel nails and I love all the shoes available for purchase. You must go and have a day of pampering!. Tiffany herself is such a beautiful person. She "slayed" everyone who sat in her chair including me. After my hair was done , I felt like I was the most prettiest I had been in a while. My hair was so silky, shiny.  I'm 45 yrs old. My self esteem was boosted. Go see her... She is worth the wait.. Went in on Wednesday 07/10 and saw Desiree Pittman. I can't tell you how long I have been searching for the perfect hair girl. Happy to report I found her!! This is the 2nd time I've seen her for my hair services (highlights and cut/trim) 3rd if you count the free bang trim in between :) she is professional, easy to talk to and best of all great at what she does. I won't go to anyone else in Vegas again. Not worth the gamble. The salon is quit and cozy, modern and fun. A perfect mix! I totally recommend Des at the loft!!. Hola, Paco. Gracias por la buena experiencia. 

Besides the food being good, their customer service is fantastic! My mom and her friend were in town and we wanted them to try Paco's Tacos. My mom ordered the brisket taco, but after a couple bites decided that it wasn't what she expected. Our server was very gracious and made the night out wonderful and got something my mom would enjoy...tres leches cake. 

I've been there a couple times and each time I've had a terrific experience. The staff are super friendly and the managers aim to please. The chips and salsa are delicioso and I have to force myself to stop eating them so I won't ruin my dinner. I've ordered the shrimp and veggie fajitas each time and they are yummy! 

Great location in the SouthPark neighborhood with a great atmosphere! When the weather is warm, it's nice to sit on the patio. The offer great specials during the week...por ejemplo, I think Mondays after 8pm their fajitas are half off.  

Thanks Paco's and staff for making our night out enjoyable!. Amazing dessert, wonderful food, and great atmosphere! My husband and I have been going there for years, and have always had wonderful meals.. Seriously top-notch! My boyfriend and I had an amazing two-night stay last week. This was our second experience with the Palomar in Phoenix. From valet to the pool bar, from the front desk to room-service it was absolutely amazing. T from valet was awesome--he remembered our names for the entire stay and was super sociable. Our late-night room service was delicious. We had an amazing bowl of chili and a quesadilla; our server was very professional and helpful. The room was gorgeous, the wine-hour and pool were fun. I cannot wait to go back!. For someone who drinks as much coffee as I do in as many cafés as possible, it's rare for a café to truly surprise me. Pourquoi Pas did, and in a very good way.

It started with ordering a latte. I was met with a simple question: what kind of milk? The options that followed were not the "skim, 2%, whole" that I'd expected, though, but rather, "house-made almond/coconut, soy, or cow's milk". Hearing "lait de vache" come across, with a slight prickliness to it, caught me off guard. (Of course I know milk comes from cows, but never when ordering a drink does that fact come to my attention.) I stumbled. I fumbled. "Regular, you know, um, milk." Herp de derp, smooth move, Katie. 

After tripping over my obviously non-vegan beverage order (callous carnivore as I am), I looked at the menu more closely and noticed that cow's milk carries an extra surcharge, and is indicated by a weepy broken heart on the chalkboard. I was tickled by their apparent display of ethics (and judgment?), and determined to try their lait maison the next time, so I could be a cool and compassionate coffee snob, too. I also noticed that their standard coffee was an Aeropress, which gets props from me (I love my home Aeropress), and also noticed the striking lack of other options on the menu. This is, uncontestedly, an espresso bar. A one-trick pony, perhaps, but that one trick is a showstopper.

The latte set before me -- made with creamy dairy goodness stolen from the mouths of bleating calves at their mothers' teats -- was phenomenal. Perfectly balanced, not bitter in the least, and made with a perfect microfoam swirled into lovely latte art. Mmmmm. 

The next time at Pourquoi Pas, not even a week later, I tried their house almond and coconut milk, and was impressed. It made great foam, and had a rich but sweet nutty flavor. But, for all that, even with the added bonus of self-righteousness for not exploiting our bovine friends, I regretted not getting cowmilk. Sweet, delicious, calorific, uncompassionate cow's milk. I'll placate my conscious by imagining that the extra charge goes toward buying the most wonderful, single-origin, free-range, fair-trade, grass-fed, eco-conscious milk from the happiest cows in Quebec. Or one can hope.. I love this place and wouldn't go anywhere else!  Great classes, beautiful locker rooms and the best and most inviting energy from the people there.  Even on days I can't exercise I go in just to say hello.  Body Heat is truly a family.  Love it!. Omg can you say yummy!!! Bought a groupon on a whim and this place blew my mind. Had the pizza and chicken parm both tasted amazing!!! Authentic Italian meal, great service and friendly staff. What else could you want?!?!. Absolutely love this place. I first found out about Body Heat when they were offering a free community class for their 1 year anniversary. A friend came along with me and we loved it! I returned a few months later to use the free week of classes that they offer but unfortunately I was only able to go one time during the week. I tried going to a class on the last day of the free trial week and the lady at the front desk told me that my week trial was up as of the day before. I'm pretty sure that a week was 7 days and not 6 days but whatever. 

I recently started going back because I received an email saying that they were offering free community classes (I feel like I'm starting to sound like a free loader lol) for the month of December (it's an opportunity to give the new certified instructors experience teaching a class). I forget the instructors name but she was phenomenal. She was very nice and you could definitely tell that she enjoys doing yoga. She was always willing to help with posture and form and show alternatives to positions if the normal positions weren't working for you. 

The only problem I have with the studio is the price of membership. They do offer a few package deals and a 15% discount for students, teachers, military and seniors. Like their family deal is $179 which can include 2 adults and one junior under 21. They also have a buddy membership deal which is $220 and can include up to 3 people who will all pay about $74 a month, which actually isn't bad at all. But being that no one in my family or in my circle of friends is interested in doing yoga with me, paying $119 a month is pretty steep. But I definitely think that if you can afford it then you should definitely join Body Heat!!. What an absolutely perfect and adorable collection of local gems!  The concept is fantastic - I love the "mini" versions of some of my favorite places.  My favorite?  The British Bicycle Company.   Those are the most insanely beautiful bikes that I have EVER seen.  And the owners of the shop are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet.  If you need a bike, don't go anywhere else!

I'm very excited to try out the restaurant and Royal Coffee in the future.  A return visit is in the very near future.. This is my favorite mall in Charlotte.  I tend to have kind of high class taste most of the time and this place makes me feel all lady-like.  There are a whole bunch of high end shops for all your needs.  From clothes to skin care to gifts and food, this place has it all.  It's even fun to just walk around and look at stuff since it's such a beautiful mall.  I definitely recommend this one to everybody.. I am almost embarrassed to say that we came here for breakfast/brunch all 3 days we were in Vegas. I also had dinner here back in March. 

Breakfast has lots of options. I tried almost everything. I really liked the chilaquiles (sort of like fried, chopped up enchiladas for those of you who have yet to try this deliciousness). The waffles, plantains, pizza, bagel and many cream cheese options were also good. There are many meat options too. 

The omelets made to order were just alright. The cooks who make them are very friendly though. The corn-beef hash was not that good. Note: their yogurt is more European (sour) in my opinion. 

What I really loved about this buffet was dinner. Save sixteen bucks and go to McDonald's for breakfast and come here for lunch or dinner. Lots of options (American, Korean, Chinese, Mexican, Italian, Indian) and everything tasted great. The standouts were the stuffed shells and Indian fare (chicken curry, rice, and garlic naan). I ate shells and naan until I needed to be wheelbarrow-ed out.. Tonight we saw JOSEPH AND THE TECHNICOLOR DREAMCOAT.  It was an incredible experience.  Parking was very accessible.  The producer, Bobb Cooper, has an amazing talent for bringing the audience the very best experience possible.  The narrator was an exceptional performer that truly delivered!   It was a non stop, fun filled, clap along, smile till your cheeks hurt show!!!  .. And I could go on and on over the costumes and props.   I've seen a lot of productions, including Broadway, and this performance delivered talent far beyond my expectations!   WELL DONE!!    a MUST see show!!!  I will be back and am proud to tell all my friends and family to see it as well!   WOW!. I am definitely a fan of Pepe's Tacos, I come here quite often, It's fresh, delicious and cheap! what else is there to say....OH well there is one thing, I come to their newest location on the corner of Rainbow and Flamingo, it's clean, spacious and well lit. Except for one thing, they do not have a diaper changing station in their bathroom's and how many Hispanics do you really see with no kids?? Just saying..... Install one please! :-). I will definitely be coming back here. Even though the hipster scene isn't really my thing, this place is awesome! I loved the different types of available seating. We ended up sitting outside in a very secluded area for our business meeting. The drinks were pretty good. Service was great. And the food... SOOOOO GOOOD. I ordered the crepe with chorizo and an egg on top and I could not get over how excellent it was. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. I also had a brown butter muffin thing which was amazing as well.. What a great little breakfast joint! Usually pretty busy and has quite the wait. We've gotten lucky a couple of times but definitely await on weekends. That said it's well worth the wait. The food is made to order and tastes like something you'd get at grandma's.  I've tried the French Toast,  waffles pancakes and chicken salad sandwich and they are all heavenly. Depending what you are in the mood for I'd vouch for any of those. I love the interior it's very quaint. Tables with chairs that don't match, tea sets in the cupboards along the back wall. My mom, daughter and I love to go for a girl's day brunch once a month.. I just started going to the Joint last week and have been only 2 times but the results have been amazing.  I feel great and the place is very clean and they are extremely friendly and professional.  I have been under chiropractic care for the past 8 months prior to this and I have to say I am so happy that I switched. The hours are convenient and now they are opening on Sundays which is wonderful! I would highly recommend them!. Thank God for Bouchon Bakery. In Vegas you are either dropping mad cash on good meals or you are eating slop at a food court. Bouchon Bakery is for those moments you can't do the former or you are not too drunk or desperate to do the latter.  I could not bring myself to pay 10.00 for a ham & cheese baguette no matter what, but a coffee, the focaccia of the day and a macaroon made an excellent mid afternoon meal.. Kept hearing good things about the happy hour here so we finally stopped in. And WOW, can't believe it took us so long to check it out - it's now one of my new fave places. The happy hour is INCREDIBLE! For $3 you get some amazing food, got 2 apps and it was more than enough as a meal. 

The 2 apps I had were the shrimp/eggplant which was so MOUTH-WATERING-DELICIOUS-I-WANT-SOME-RIGHT-NOW good, and also the margherita flatbread (also tasty). 

Hubby had the Brio burger and it was HUGE. 

The drinks were not on happy hour (boo) but I was happy to pay the $8 for the pomegranate martinis because they were delish! 

We loved the place so much we took advantage of their gift card special, buy $100 and get a $20 card free.  Can't wait to go back!. We love this place!  The hubby and I come every other week for lunch and split a heck of a slice and the Oreganos Favorite salad. They usually send us out the door with a huge to go drink, such a cheap thing that makes customers super happy. 

As a family, we eat here at least once a month. The thin crust is our preference and it never disappoints. The kids always insist on the pazzookie which never lasts more than 2 minutes on the table. 

It's one of our neighborhood joints and we love it!  You simply can't go wrong here...but be aware if you show up on a Friday or Saturday might be prepared to wait. It's not a huge place.. This place is awesome.  There is never a very long wait and the servers are very friendly.  They serve a complementary salad and have very reasonable prices.  The rolls are always very full of fish and have the perfect amount of fresh rice. This is my favorite sushi place I have found in town.. Was a guest of Aria last summer...which then got me interested in the first public space fine art collection offered. Exists around Mandarin Oriental, at Aria, Veer Towers, and Vdara. All the more appealing now that Guggenheim has shut its doors.

This time, we left the Encore and went to Westin in order to be closer to the heart of Strip. After Le Reve, we went off to enjoy Mirage's LOVE. also closer.

Breathtaking. Though it was 117 degrees, our scorching scavenger-hunt like tour with assistance of spray and water bottle was wonderful! Henry Moore, Maya Lin, sculptures, paintings, prints (Christopher Walken), etc.

Great treat for those who prefer not to gamble. And great way to walk off great, overindulgent food too!

PS download the app as we did. Sure made finding the marvelous pieces waay easier. Be prepared to walk!!. I love everything about this place. It would be a cool venue in any city, but considering it is the the entertainment wasteland that is Phoenix, the Crescent Ballroom is exceptional.

Most of the shows I've gone to in the past year have been either here or at the Marquee. Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! Compare the friendly staff to the surly workers at the Marquee. The wonderful temperature control versus the sweltering heat. The clean, plentiful bathrooms instead of cesspool restrooms. And what about the free water stations, great cocktails, stadium seats, and a damn tasty veggie burro big enough for two?

All of these great elements make Crescent Ballroom a shining star in Cen Pho. In a town where venue after venue is shutting down, I couldn't be happier that this place is thriving.. Love this place, my boyfriend and I love that there is such a decent sushi place on the Far East side. It's even reliable for Togo orders. I highly suggest this restaurant. The sashimi has always been fresh and they have decently priced drinks.. Alcohol.  Lots and lots of alcohol.  Reminded me of BevMo.

5 Stars.. Amazing staff and amazing beer! We had never been here before but a Groupon deal came up and we decided to snag one. Best idea we ever had. We got a flight of eight beers, a pint of our favorite and a growler to come home with. On top of that they gave you pretzels to munch on (definitely needed when sampling everything)! The place was packed but the workers and owners were attentive and helpful when describing the beers. 

Definitely check it out if you are in the area and like good beer. They have some food but we didn't eat so I can't report on that...yet!. I enjoyed my visit here. We were out and about and decided to stop for a bit. The service was excellent and she was very accommodating to my specific requests. Enjoyed this visit.. Love this place since they opened! Very reasonable price, good deal on Happy Hour! The system has huge selection of songs in varies languages. You'll never get in trouble to find a song. Private room is a Plus. Keep you time chill with your friends ONLY. And if you dare to show your singing technique or have a huge group, go on the main stage to challenge!. Disclosure: I used to be an employee here! That being said, I love this office and this staff! I don't have enough words to describe how great this office is! They will treat you with the same respect and care that they treat their own family with! 
I will do everything in my power to travel here every year for an eye exam because Dr. McMullen is that great of a doctor!
If you want to be seen at a place where people care about you and your family, come to Salt River Eye Care!. candice is the best.......we got food super quick......very very pleasant person........if you don't send her to disney.......your a fool....lol. Wheee fun shopping ! You  want to know  what  made the shopping super fun? Sure you do.. It was  having  many types of stores that were quality without being too extravagant . For example La Sur Table , high quality kitchen supplies for   chopping, flipping and serving  needs  ..love it,  Crate and Barrel  great home goods for reasonable prices ...  Smith and Hawkins unique garden supplies ... And of course always love Anthropologie..   a cool, eclectic blend  of  clothes and home goods.  There  are other solid places to shop too !  If you haven't been to  Kierland,  you'll notice it's set up like a little quaint town with a sweet grassy area by the ice cream place.. After we had dinner at Fix, our hostess brought us over to Caramel to have a round of drinks.  Lucky us, we had a bottle comp'd to our table and also got a free round of shots from one of the guy's in the table next to us.  Caramel is a really nice place to grab a drink before heading out to really party.  They played a good mix of music - 80's, 90's and Top 40.  The ambiance was pretty dark and chill - we only stayed there long enough to finish our bottle of vodka and leave to The Bank so we could get the party started!!. My spouse and I were looking for a specific Pathfinder book and didn't feel like ordering it online. A couple people had recommended Action Comics as a good RPG/boardgame store and we were in the area, so we decided to check it out.

The store itself is larger than many other comic stores. Most of the middle of the store is dedicated to tables. When we walked in on a Saturday there were four or five games going on. It looks like a popular place to play Magic or Warhammer. 

The selection of boardgames was good, and I appreciated the "Free Boardgames to play" section, although I didn't take them up on that. I was also ecstatic that  they had miniatures for Pathfinder and many other games. I don't play Warhammer, but they had a decent section of the wall dedicated to pieces from that game.

I didn't purchase any comics, but they seemed to have a good assortment. They also had other bits of nerdery: t-shirts, posters, statues, pins, materials for painting figures and dice. We ended up buying a lot of paint and brushes for painting our miniatures, and the employees/other patrons were very helpful with their advice.

If I lived in the area I would definitely consider playing there.. I really love cupcakes! My favorite here is the pistachio. My only thing I could say I don't like is too much butter cream frosting. I usually take off half of it then it's perfect! The cake itself is a bit dense. It's great in cupcake size but a whole cake is a bit much for me. The girls that work here are lovely.. I don't get out this way often but on my way to a movie at Red Rock we thought we would check out a few places and this place caught our eye.  The Chef Bradley Ogden who is great at transforming traditional american food into an amazing sensation has done it again in my opinion.  Not only does it have a great american food appeal but a bit of a twist to everything to appeal to all food or foodie  types.  

We were greeted and seated at a booth in the back away from the action.  Started to look over the menu got our drinks and the manger came over to ask if we needed anything.  I thought it was great service on top of the great service we had already received.  As we ponder the menu we really came to a point of "wow it all looks good and what the heck do we order?!  We decided to do family style for 3.  The waitress helped us in our selections and told us about each dish to help our decision.

Our apps for the table included Seared Tuna Sliders they set a great tone for the whole meal.  Great...
Maytag Blue Cheese Souffle/ I could have possibly eaten the whole plate! OMG good The soft but rich flavors of the cheese melted in my mouth, I so wanna go back for this ALONE!
Spicy BBQ Pork Belly It was great moist and delish!
My next choice was a Caesar Salad something this chef is known for and now I know why.  It was the creamiest blend with a mix of things I remembered.  I ate this salad like there was no tomorrow it was probably the best salad I have ever had...  

I will be back and I will enjoy some of my new favorites and anything new on the menu!  Great service and great food.... The watermelon margarita was very good! Just saying, Lol ... Had dinner here to celebrate my grandsons birthday. First time at this location. Quite busy during the dinner hours as expected. Food and service was good and food was brought out fast and hot like i like it .... Wow what an amazing good service 
Most important is the service! Big like! 
The desert we had called chocolate semosa ! Omg!!. Not my first time here, but had such a great experience in the drive-thru. Nina was so friendly and engaging, I found myself wanting to chat with her. This wasn't an ordinary fast-food visit. I'll come back just to see her again. The food has never disappointed at this location, either. I recommend this spot.. Yeah I'm one if those annoying 'apple' people that gets excited when new apple products come out.  I'm (picture me whispering) a big nerd.  The staff here is super friendly and knowledgable.  I recently decided to purchase a MacBook Air and my friendly sales associate asked where I work.  He wasn't just creating meaningless banter but informed me of a discount because of where I work!  Achievement unlocked!  Ooh wait,  is my nerd showing again?. Simple and a bit overpriced, but so delicious. Perfect late night snack but there will be a long wait (which isn't so great when you've been in heels all night). There is a very small counter with a few stools, but luckily we were able to find some seats near the pool table right outside the entrance.. This hotel has just been completely upgraded, it is beautiful, spotless and very traveler friendly. It has a more modern, contemporary look to it, you are greeted by a very sleek check in desk and just beyond that is a 'GO Board' which is a huge touch screen for looking up restaurants, directions, things to do etc. They have thought of everything, they now have a Bistro that serves very fresh healthy food, Starbucks coffee as well as a full bar.  You can order your Egg White and Spinach sandwich for breakfast and enjoy it in one of the 'Media Pods,' which is a private booth with table and TV. The outdoor patio/pool area includes a fireplace and new furniture.  The gym has all new equipment and the air conditioning is kept at a very comfortable degree. All the beds, bedding, furniture, TV's, decor and carpeting have been replaced providing a clean relaxing envirionment for the business or holiday traveler, as well as clients using the Mayo Clinic. Plenty of parking with a complementary shuttle is also available. The service is exemplary, the staff are friendly and helpful and seem very well trained, everyone was aware of their work and the services offered by the entire hotel.  Give this little jem a try, it's close to Fountain Hills and downtown Scottsdale, the Phoenix airport is about 20 minutes away.. SOOOO happy this place finally opened! Glendale needed a nice bar with good food! We have been coming here every weekend now! The golden wings have by far become my favorite, so yummy! The food is good and guess what...? The prices arent even that bad! always friendly servers. also have cool shuffle board games, and the outside patio has misters..ALOT. you don't even feel hot when you go out there i love it!. I'm an American who studied and lived in Montreal for 5 years and will take a Montreal bagel over a NY one any day. Don't get me wrong - I love NY bagels, but there's something about Montreal-style bagels that are just amazing. Anyway, I digress. 

If you simply want to get a freshly made bagel to go, I would recommend going to any of the St. Viateur bagel factory shops instead. If you want to sit down and enjoy a delicious bagel sandwich with a side salad and maybe a cappuccino, then definitely come to this cafe instead. Do catch the attention of one of the servers first, and she/he will sit you. Make sure you have cash on hand, as this place only accepts cash now. There are a couple of banks nearby, so you can withdraw some beforehand. 

Highly recommended stop when visiting Montreal.. We have been here 3 times.  These have been our observations:

Pros:
Great Service
Great deserts
Great Tacos
Cons:
Average Burger
A little on the pricey side

We went on Easter for Brunch and had a five star experince.  3 of us shared a pitcher of Sangria, Tuna Tartar (AMAZING) and 3 breakfast plates.  The chilaqilies are to die for!!!!  All the for $75 before tip.. I'll admit it - I have a crush on Bobby, always have.

I had just arrived in town and dumped my suitcase off at the hotel, took off my MN winter clothes and put on my Vegas bumming around clothes and headed out.  It was off peak time, so it was pretty quiet.

I love the fact I do not need to walk a million miles (that's dramatic) through a casino to get to this place.  I like that it's on the street.

I was the only one actually eating a meal and couldn't decide what to get since everything looked good.  I settled on the the Chicken Breast Miami style, a half order of fries and rings (to split) and a diet coke.  We sat at the counter and food took a decent amount of time to arrive.

Sandwich was good size and the sides big enough to split so I'm glad I had a dining companion to finish them up.  My food was decent and I have a feeling if I liked burgers or had ordered a turkey burger I would give it 5 stars.  I got what I needed out of the meal and would go back for a quick lunch.. Always love this place! Great food and they have the nicest employees! I can always count on them to get my order ready fast! Especially love the service from Daniel,Cindy, Ronnie, Travis and Wendy !  Such a great place to go with your family even thought half of it is a pub it doesn't feel like one. Good place to get peace and quiet, they also offer a nice outdoor patio covered perfect for the morning or mid afternoon!. Jackie is the best!  Her salon is beautiful and clean and she is so professional.  I have been coming here for several years and have always been so happy with how beautiful my nails are when I leave. It's a relaxed, lovely atmosphere and the deluxe massage chair is heaven. I highly recommend it!. I can't speak highly enough about Nedda. She helped me with some legal family issues and I ended up with a better outcome than I had even hoped for! Overall, I'd say I had an excellent experience with an excellent attorney. Thank you!. The fiance and I came here for a fancy romantic dinner and we were not disappointed. The service was great and the atmosphose was perfect. We started off the meal with the jumbo shrimp cocktail. WOW, these shrimp were JUMBO. The biggest shrimp I've ever seen, and their cocktail sauce was perfect. It had just enough tang. 

And for the main course we both ordered the aged NY steak and they were so juicy with a nice smokey taste. We also ordered a side of their sauteed green beans. THIS IS A MUST! The green beans will suprise you. I'm not sure what they sauteed them with, but it was just SO GOOD. They were a perfect compliment to the steak. For dessert, we got the lemoncello flute which was basically a lemon sorbet, but so much better! It was very refreashing. 

Overall, it was a great night out and I think it's well worth the money.. This was my first time at Four Peaks Brewing! 

Having the bright tanks and the brewing equipment right where you sit and drink their beer, was a fantastic idea. It makes the space look much larger and if you are anything like me - I like to know how they make the brew, with this set up you can see it right before your eyes!

 I've recently made the AZ Peach my favorite summer time brew! It's so light and refreshing - you can taste the peach, but it's not overwhelming. If you don't believe me, Try it! You can most likely find it at one of your local restaurant and pubs. I frequent the Uncle Bears by our house they offer the tasty delight. AHH!!!

I haven't had much of the menu so I can't really say - but I really enjoyed the environment and I just can't believe I haven't been here before!!!

Don't wait! Check it out! I will update as soon as I have a proper meal, but their beer is so good, I expect the same!!

Until then Yelpers!. I saw the show over the weekend on Saturday evening and I loved it. I was with a group of girls and it was a blast though the show is for kids. We got VIP seats which let us sit at the bar while we waited instead of waiting in line. 

He features animals he saved from the animal shelter which won my heart. 

Animals were adorable and I would recommend the show to anyone. We took a picture before the show and you can buy it at the end. Popovich signed our photo at the end of the show and he was very gracious.. I've always come here during lunch & can't seem to deviate from the al-la-carte beef taco & sharing an extra crispy quesadilla... what can I say? I like it *that* much* My friends have had more the variety, we all greatly like the food. Chips & salsa are pretty yummers!. We are staying on the strip and are so tired of overpriced junk food. I looked up Greek food on yelp and found this place. I was only a short drive from the strip that was well worth it. I ordered food to go, I got a Greek salad with grilled chicken, a chicken gyro with fries, and a piece of baklava. The food was still hot and delicious after I got back to our hotel. The salad was so fresh and the chicken well seasoned. The chicken gyro had some of the most scrumptious feta I have ever had and it was topped with fresh tomatoes and lettuce. The baklava was out of this world! I definitely recommend this place to anyone staying near the strip who wants fresh and reasonably priced instead of bland and overpriced! The woman who helped me with my order was very courteous and the food was ready in less than 10 minutes. Eat here!. I stumbled onto the great shop last Friday.  They give you discounts if you buy multiple fragrances.  It is pretty great.  Employee was really great.  If you haven't stopped in, you should!. Awesome food, and Tenny the owner is so sweet! My husband loves the yellow curry, and I love the red.. I have been looking for a couple of months for a new tanning salon that felt like home and I think I found it!  This salon is clean, has a good selection of lotions for sale and most importantly, the staff members are super friendly!. This was your standard chineese take out, which is what I wanted. The fried rice was good, not dry like previous reviews stated. The fried dumplings were deep fried not pan fried like I was expecting but the dipping sauce was good. I would eat here again.. I love coming here. This is the biggest mall in the Phoenix metro area. It is three stories and extremely huge! It boasts your typical mall stores, but also has many high-end stores, as well (well, we ARE talking Scottsdale). The food court is huge and their are plenty of places to eat (Kona Grill, Yard House...) among so many other stores! Furniture (Crate & Barrel).. They also have many of the only stores available in AZ (Zara, for example, is only located here in this state). Valet is offered. 

You WILL get lost here if it's your first time. You will also probably get lost for the next 10 times you shop here. Enjoy.. Saturday night after a long day of being in the sun we ordered pizza, I had a quick errand to run so I chose pickup instead of delivery. I've never been to Barro's before and was just hoping it would taste better than Papa Johns and somewhat close to Spinato's because that's our go-to place in the area. 

When I went to pick up the pizzas there was an issue but it was 100% my fault in my opinion, I didn't clarify my order when I placed it. The girl behind the counter politely disagreed, stated if the person who took the order had followed up with questions it would have been made correctly. I thought that was awesome and she even offered to remake them. No need, I have hungry folks at my house and need to get home. But, she did discount my pizzas to apologize for the error and I thought that was more than generous. 

I also took a large salad to go. I LOVE THAT I CAN MAKE MY OWN SALAD. I like 5 pounds of mushrooms on a salad and I was able to do that. I would have been in a long time ago if I knew about this DIY side salad. 

The customer service alone deserves 5 stars. I walked in the house and made the statement, even if the pizza is gross, I'm still going back!! But, it wasn't gross at all. It was fantastic!!
If I had ordered it correctly it would have been a thin crust, so I can't be mad at all the extra dough. But, spot on. 

I am certain the next time we need a pizza to do, we will be calling this place first. The prices are fair, the customer service is good and it's pretty darn tasty!!. For Goodness Shake is a new dessert shop located on Flamingo and 215. Their mission statement is to ,"Indulge with a purpose". They're also working with three sq...For every shake or smoothie purchased, a child gets a meal through Three Square Food Bank, a great way to help the less fortunate in our community. It's a good reminder to the community that we all have a social responsibility to give back.

They are located right by the gym which might not be the best location for them. Their shakes are very sweet and probably not the healthiest thing you should choose to have after killing yourself at the gym. 

I got the Almondcado because it comes with Almond milk (I'm lactose intolerant). The milkshake was extremely sweet but good for what it was supposed to be...FG Shake serves milkshakes...not smoothies. This is not the place to go if you are looking for a healthy after the gym smoothie. 

The concept is fun and modern...very kid friendly. 
I probably won't be back much just because I'm not a fan of milkshakes.. I was excited when I saw on the Delano website that 3940 Coffee and Tea offers afternoon tea - I love afternoon tea and I was going to be staying at the hotel so how perfect was that?!  I did not see any information on tea reservations on the website, so I called the hotel to inquire about it.  The person I spoke with did not sound too knowledgeable when asked about afternoon tea reservations, and even sounded as if she was reading straight from the website while I was speaking with her.  In the end she told me that 3940 was a walk-in only establishment, so walk in is what we did.

Imagine our disappointment when we were informed that afternoon tea was by 24-hour advance notice only.  After explaining the above to the barista, he spoke with a manager in the back, Tiffany, who then came out to speak with us.  We were told that due to the busy season being over that there were less employees; therefore, afternoon tea could no longer be offered on a daily basis.  We were going to be in town for such a short amount of time and could not squeeze their afternoon tea any other time during our stay, so the manager apologized for the misinformation on the website and over the phone and made sure we did not leave disappointed.  She offered to make us our teas herself even though it was something she had not really done before, and even brought us some pastries - all on the house!  We basically got our afternoon tea after all, without the savory sandwiches, though.  That by all means was okay with us, as we were well taken care of by management.  Thank you, Tiffany, for serving us personally and making sure we left happy customers :)

Afternoon tea is no longer listed on the website, so if you are interested, I would suggest rather than calling actually going to 3940 to ask about it and make reservations - just give 24 hours advance notice.  (Assuming that they are still doing afternoon tea.)  If it's still offered, I highly suggest it - teas were tasty and pastries fresh and yummy!  Cozy living room feel to the place also - part coffee shop, part cozy living room.  It would have been nice to taste their sandwiches as well, but maybe next time :). I was recently scrabbling to find beautiful + tasty desserts after plan A (Cake Artist's Studio) failed.  I called Mirabelle to check their hours (everything shuts down in CU over the holidays) and availability of cool stuff.  They totally came through for me with boxes upon boxes of what looked like had just arrived from a French patisserie but had in fact been baked that morning in Urbana.  They pulled all of this together in less than an hour.  My guests were in heaven as we devoured it all.. I have seen this show 4 times.  It is fun and the performers are amazing and so talented.  If you can only see on Cirque Du Soleil in LV, this is the one to see.  ...and it  is reasonably priced for front section seats.. After constantly putting air in my tires EVERY morning for 2 weeks I finally decided to take care of it.  I have always had my husband deal with everything that involves the word CAR.  I went online to look up the closest location and found one 5 minutes away from me and I was able to make an appointment online. 
Got to Discount Tire about 10 minutes early was seen quickly. They took my car back and told me it would be about 45 minutes.  I am sure glad I made an appointment, a lady came in and asked how long she would be there and she was told an hour and a half.  My name was called 20 minutes into my arrival.  Was told there was a nail in my tire and they fixed it...FOR FREE!  They didn't try to sell me on new tires or protection plans, nothing!. Gave me my keys and I was on my way. I highly recommend getting an appointment so you don't have to wait long.. A perfect meal in Vegas! Although the wait was over an hour long, we immediately found a table in the bar which turned out to be more intimate than any of the tables in the dining room. Service was prompt; the waitress delightful and extremely knowledgeable. This was literally the best meal I have ever shared with my boyfriend of nearly a year. Each item was split and served on two plates in perfect presentation: the heirloom tomato salad, the blackened halibut. The brussel sprouts and lobster mash potatoes were of plenty proportions - and the mash had the most perfect creamy flavor with an abundance of lobster. The variety of breads were served warm with soften tabs of butter. Ever staff person was attentive. The drinks, a pomegranate martini and cucumber cooler, were a homerun. I've never tasted something better in my life. If I had the room, I know the butter cake would kick butt of any cake I ever ate (I'm going back today to make sure). And the coffee served at the end of the meal was the testament that the entire meal was EPIC. Thank you Mastro!. This place is good. Really good, actually. It's sort of hard to find, tucked away in some pseudo-industrial officeplex on E Patrick (just west of Del Sol, on the north side of the street). You can definitely tell it's a locally owned and operated kinda place. It would get five stars, but my corned beef sandwich was, though completely satisfactory, not stellar. My friend's meatball sub, however, WAS stellar. So get that. They make their meatballs fresh by hand. In fact, the owner is the one who made our sandwiches. Nice guy, in an east coat deli proprietor sorta way. Really, they deserve five stars just for the "no students in the bathroom" signs on the bathroom doors. Pretty damn funny if you ask me. Definitely worth checking out for a quick lunch, especially on your way to or from McCarran. As far as delis in Las Vegas go, you're really not gonna do any better. And that's not a bad thing.. First time in Vegas and enjoyed the Mirage immensely!
First night we were upgraded to suite!!!! To congratulate me on graduating from grad school. Now that's what i call treating your guests well.
A 24 hr restaurant, the Pantry, is a few steps away from the guests elevators. How convenient is that!
Rooms that face the strip get to see the Volcano erupt from their window. Now thats a sight to see!
Next trip im stating at The Mirage for sure!. From out of town and since we are not from Vegas we wanted a buffet! We don't always do a buffet since its a big food commitment but when we do we don't like being disappointed. Fortunately we weren't and the food was hearty and good. A lot of healthy choices but great meat choices and seasonings. They had 2 types of broth that change each day and 3 rices including the mixed purple rice. Clear noodles, Korean sides, 3 kimchi styles, porridge (different types) and bim bim bop. They had buffet sushi which had the crab meat but it was very fresh and pleasant. The dessert was light and I was actually content they did not have pastries but fruit and a sweet ginger drink that helped my tommy after that large meal. 

Service was friendly. They didn't make me feel embarrassed asking questions, many, about the food and points on cooking it. They checked on us often which was also great because they were not in a hurry to help us and go to the next table. 

I will add some bad things here only to be a little less biased after a great experience. The broth needed some more seasoning I felt (I love pho broth, I know that's Vietnamese). . . And the dessert had no baked goods? I can't think of many negative points. If you want a good buffet and are missing Korean food, you won't be disappointed!. On Wed I brought my SUV in because of a loud "whirr" sound. I thought it was a belt and these mechanics thought so also.  After close examination they knew it wasn't as they first thought and determined it was two pulleys and a belt. They apologized for the delays (had to wait until Thursday for original parts order.) They got the correct parts in, then on Friday notified us, and we took car back and it is all fixed and "purrs like a kitten". Thank you to Sam Oakley, Robert Buchanan, Eddy and Mike, & the new trainee and trainer. (Don't know their names. :-(oops)
Great job guys! I want everyone to know how honest these mechanics are. Rarity and they are my "gems" ! Making this my auto repair shop. Keep up the great work.. The chicken tiki masala is delicious and the servers were so nice.  When we first pulled up we were not so sure because it looks small and old and in an older area but once you got inside it was ok and smelled so good.. I've been practicing Pilates regularly for four years in two different states. When I find a studio I'm impressed with, I'm very loyal. It's all about the instructors, their education of the body and the energy they bring. I've been quite pleased with Ashly and Kimra here and I recommend their classes. They are authentic, warm and go above and are proficient in giving personal attention to your form and making adjustments when needed. They don't offer a cookie cutter approach, knowing everyone's body is different.  Also gives adequate time after a move to stretch the muscles you just worked. I do however wish they would begin offering classes on the Chair machine. They have the equipment, but no Chair class yet. I'm patiently waiting and looking forward to it. If you haven't tried Chair, its an amazing full body workout when done right. I've never seen results so amazing.. Unlike any other place in the valley - the best guacamole & salsa, interesting & unique dishes and really cool atmosphere (especially the adjacent room w/ the fireplace on the side.) One of my favorites for a cozy bite to eat! A great escape!. I am new to Yelp reviews but have been treating with Raza for about a year and a half.  If he isn't available (which is typical because he is so amazing), I will not settle for anyone else.  Raza has an innate ability to sense where my pain stems from.  His technique focuses on resolution of my pain rather than just purely relaxation.  (However, I'm sure he would give me a purely relaxing massage if I wanted it.)  I always leave feeling 150% better than when I arrived.  Thank you, Raza!!!. Love Troon! Troon and The Boulders are my top 2 favorite courses in Arizona. Highly recommended. Not cheap, but worth it once you're out on the course. Very well maintained and just downright gorgeous. Awesome desert views and vibrant green fairways and greens. The entire staff is so nice too! Everyone seemed to really enjoy working there and were happy people. Always a plus in my book when you receive great service. I am looking forward to my next round at Troon!. They are excellent!! My fiancée has had his haircut here twice and no matter who you get, you'll get great service and a nice haircut!! You can definitely tell that a haircut, to these barbers, is more of an art than just a haircut! They take their time, listen, and make sure you walk away happy with their work!! We will be back!!. In a moment of panic when my borrowed, very old... very beat up pickup wouldn't start, Stuckert's Towing was the only place that would answer the phone at only 630pm on a weekday! 

The man who answered the phone was polite and informative and friendly; he answered all my questions and put my mind at ease. 

In less than 10 minutes a tow truck showed up and he had the car running along with some tips on where to get a battery and what may be causing the surprising and seemingly out of nowhere battery drain.

In a moment of true Pennsylvania "small town-ness" the driver happened to be from the very same tiny small town I grew up in. He was incredibly polite and good natured. I'd hesitate to call any other service center for auto service needs.. I've read a lot of reviews about the decor not being much to look at. I found the restaurant comfortable. If they just dimmed the lights a little it might be downright cute. Jake: Much to my disappointment, I saw no magic eyes. But the mural was hilarious!

The service was excellent when we went! We had a party of 6, with diverse tastes. The waiter sized up each person and knew just how to make suggestions and offer helpful advise on menu selections. He was quick with a refill, but not obnoxiously so. He definitely got this place the four stars!

The food was pretty good. I wasn't expecting much when I saw Chimichangas on the menu, but the green corn tamales were to die for. I also had an enchilada, but I would probably stick with the tamales when I go back, which should be soon!. So far the BEST steak house I have been to in LV. Went this past weekend and have already made my reservations for my next trip in 2 weeks. 

Since everyone in my group was getting steaks, I decided to mooch off of them and indulge my self in other pleasantries. So I got the West Coast Kushi oysters - similar to Kumamotos - my fav. I also got the bone marrow - nothing spectacular - a bit plain actually, just the marrow and some toast. I like it when marrow is spruced up a bit with capers and greens. So I wont be ordering this again from here. I also wanted to get the Fois Grois but the waiter suggested the Pate. It was good, but wish I had gone with my previous choice. The Pate - since i was eating it by myself - was a bit too heavy for only one to consume, especially when paired with the rich taste of the marrow - my bad overall, I should have considered it. 

My friend's Filet was AMAZING the most beautiful piece of meet you've ever seen. I will probably be getting that on ym next trip. My boyfriend's aged rib eye - rare - was succulent . My other friend got his rib eye med rare and it wa s bit too dry. We enjoyed a nice Syrah - $80, the lesser end of the list, but still lovely. 

The scalloped potatoes were awesome, as was the jalapeno cream corn. The Sides there are a MUST - get as many as your stomach can handle! AND you may not think you have room for desert but share the coconut passion fruit sorbet plate with your table - you'll be glad you did. The tangy fruitiness is an excellent way to end the heaviness of the meal - along with a double espresso, of course, to kick you out of the coma.. I love this place! This was the second time my girlfriends and I have been to Koi and we had a blast! The vibe is awesome and the food is delicious. We shared all of our entrees and I have to say there wasn't a dull dish in the bunch. The lamb chops, black cod, lobster and dragon rolls were my particular favorites! The cocktails are to die for and the service was excellent. They are 2/2 in providing a cute waiter to our table of ladies, which is much appreciated :) They worked well with a big group and I would highly recommend it for a bday celebration, bachelorette party, or whatever shenanigans bring you and your friends to Vegas!

Oh, and I cannot forget to mention the Dessert Sampler tray...OMG! So good and fun to share...cheesecake, lava cake, ice cream...delicious!

I highly recommend Koi and I can't wait to visit the location in LA!. I love it here! It's INCREDIBLE. the staff is sweet and humorous. I could never find a place that will do my nails correctly and they'll be able to stay on, but it's been a little over two weeks and my nails aren't even lifting. :) im extremely satisfied. They're also VERY polite over the phone, but it's always busy so make sure you book an appointment!. This place was exactly what I expected it to be, and a little more. The goods I was interested in (bento box accessories) aren't the easiest to find, and the prices were either on par with or only slightly higher than what I could have found on ebay for the same items, which is great because I neither have to pay for nor wait for shipping. I wish there were plain elastic bento bands, but I settled for an adjustable belt-style one anyway. 

What I really appreciated about this store was how many products and how much variety was packed into such a small space while still being surprisingly organized! Some of the items there may be cheaper in Chinatown, but you'd spend more time looking for it there. Many of the products have cute hand-written labels or even instructions, which is really helpful for those of us who otherwise could not read the kanji on the original packaging. The woman who was running the shop the night we were there was extremely sweet and helpful, which always makes any shopping experience more enjoyable. I ended up getting 4 small plastic containers, food picks, a bento band, a tea strainer, and some yan-yan for a snack for $11.

On a side note, my husband was really impressed by their model kit offerings. So it looks like we'll be back!. I was impressed by the customer service at Eco Wash! They also did a great job cleaning my car. As soon as I pulled up I was great by a young guy who was very polite and professional. Decided to get the  $30 package since my mats could also used a wash.  I waited inside and had an epic chair massage. An employee came to notify me that the small crack in my windshield could be fixed and covered under my insurance. He made the call and fixed the damage right away! I was asked to inspect my car to make sure it was cleaned to my liking and it was. Looked great and was a very fair price! I was in and out in no time! Nice experience. Will definitely go back!. There was a little blurb of a review in the Arizona Republic newspaper over the Thanksgiving weekend about the Big Jim Sandwich and the Beignets here. Beignets, you say? Yes please. 
I thought it would be a good place to take dear papa for lunch; turns out they open at 5 pm. So we made our way through rush hour traffic from north Phoenix to this "middle of nowhere" place on a Tuesday night. I expected small but I didn't expect teeny tiny. However, the warm and genuinely friendly service- YEP we felt WELCOME - more than made up for the close quarters.
Our fish po'boys  and beignets in local honey were SUPERB! Totally worth the adventure.. I was in Vegas for my anniversary and decided to try this place. Overall, I had a great experience here. The food was awesome! I was on a mission to find the best Thai Beef Salad and I think I found it here! The service was phenomenal. 

If you ever go to Las Vegas and want to dine away from Strip, this is the place to go.. What a lovely wee pub! 

I had the pleasure of visiting Dalriada this weekend as part of a Hen do, after luxuriating in the Turkish baths.  It's in a gorgeous old converted house right on the beach, and if I'm remembering correctly has outdoor seating for patrons to be able to take in the rare sunshine.  

 We were told we could get tea and cake so I was surprised to discover that it's a proper pub which also has good tea, coffee and cakes for people like us who needed re-hydrating.

There was actually a funeral reception (is that the right terminology??) going on, so there were platters of sandwiches and some really awesome music.  

Dalriada will definitely be my go-to Portobello pub in the future.. Very courteous staff who are proactive in assuring your pets safety. They are very professional at Camp Bow Wow. I would highly recommend!. Bartender Angie was amazing!!!! She really made the experience great. She was very friendly and her drinks were all soooo delicious. You could tell she really enjoyed her job and it for sure showed. We stopped at the bar for one drink and ended up staying for a couple more JUST because of her. We will most definitely be returning to the Venetian and stopping by to say hi to Angie again :). I was impressed with the amount of TVs with the games available. Everyone in their jersey! Great Football environment! They brought me out a Free cornbread as a first time guest. The waitress was super helpful and personable.  She made great suggestions! The managers wet on the floor the whole time interacting with the customers. Food was awesome...great smoked hot wings!. It's expensive but worth the money. Don't necessarily like the owner, but the food is great!. I stopped in as a last minute resort for my 10 year old son's haircut. Rhonda asked my son and I what we wanted for his hair. I showed her a picture and right away she critiqued the cut and said she was going to do even better than that of which I showed her. SHE DID JUST THAT! I was very pleased and so was my son. I will be taking my sons to her from now on.. Not unlike its namesake, this joint has an unassuming exterior and pure delight on the inside. Stopped in here for a late lunch during a business trip, and as with nearly all other Yelpers, the food and service did not disappoint. There are three shared-seating areas (2 small bars and and long community table). There are several small 2-person tables and a couple larger tables. Decor was pleasant with a down-to-earth-but-hip, urban vibe. Very casual atmosphere. Not fancy, just fun.

Lunch: I dined with two business colleagues, and we enjoyed everything we tried. We started with an appetizer Combo Caribe (yuca fries, tostones, and maduro). The accompanying jalapeno-crema and the light green-chile salsa were pleasantly spicy and delicious. I ordered the Lunch Special, opting for the Pernil (slow-roasted pork) and Ham and Cheese empandas which were served with rice, black beans, and cabbage salad ($7.95). I think anything would be delicious wrapped in that perfect pastry crust, so it was especially nice that the fillings were also spectacular. The cabbage salad was simply dressed with a light acidity, proving an especially nice foil for the rich pastry. My colleagues each ordered a special "Arroz con Colombia," which they devoured, echoing high praise between mouthfuls, stopping only to swallow and eat more. They may have breathed; not sure. Sadly for me, they didn't share! This tasty-looking dish was an achiote-seasoned rice served with shrimp, sausage, and vegetables (peppers, carrots). It looked like paella (without the crisped rice bottom). Taking their word and empty plates, it must be fantastic.

To accompany the meal there was a small, thoughtful selection of bottled beers, cider, and sodas. We finished our delightful lunch by splitting the guava and the fig-caramel dessert empanadas (yes, I'm nicer than the boys!). Fig-caramel was amazing, with just a touch of salt (maybe from the cheese?) to balance the sweet caramel and I adored the just-right textures of crispy-chewy-creamy. Mmm.

When I return, the Pernil and Fig-Caramel will remain a must-order. I will venture into other savory flavors and report back.. This is our favorite breakfast spot, but it is not just for breakfast. Josh had a Gyro sandwich today and it was delicious. I've found the French Toast and things to be my favorite. Biscuits and gravy is decent - but I am biased and like to make my own at home.
If Casey is your server, I can guarantee that he will treat you well! 
Great food at reasonable prices.. Amazing pizza and salads.  The Bianca is the only Pizza I've tried here because its so amazing, I don't want anything else.  Would give 5 stars if they had a decent wine list!. Ordered the Salted Carmel in a waffle cone, it was the best ice cream I have had in a really long time.  They have such a variety of flavors.  Well worth it.. I grew up on classic board games like monopoly, clue, and candyland, and only in the last 5 years or so have I been venturing out to the less traditional-but-extremely popular games like munchkins, magic, and Puerto Rico. 

Based on their selection, this is not the place to go if you're looking for a run of the mill game, (although they had a decent variety of the classic games for all ages). 

However, if you're like me and you want to try something more unique than Risk, and you don't know where to begin... Gamekeeper is the place to go. Staff are very knowledgeable about board games and card games, and their knowledge is leaps and bounds above any staff member I've ever encountered at a game shop in a shopping mall. (No teenagers working here only for the paychecks, that's for sure!) 

In response to the other reviewer who didn't receive a "hello" when she entered - we did get a quick greeting, but we weren't followed around/harassed while we perused. But as someone who is a little socially awkward, I can appreciate that the absence of "more" doesn't mean the staff are not friendly or helpful. In fact, quite the opposite -- staff were generous with their time and very helpful when we finally asked a few questions. 

Will be definitely going back here if and when we need advice on the next game to add to our growing game collection!. I came here for a birthday party today and I have to say I had no clue what to expect from the Sophie Snow (I got the Mango), but it was absolutely amazing! It was so light, so fruity and so refreshing. It's the best treat for summer! Besides that, the place is very clean, very happy and the owners are absolutely wonderful! Be sure to check them out, they have a variety of yummy drinks that are just as refreshing as their treats. Wish I could give this place 6 stars!! :). LOVED it. LOVED.

I went to Bar Marco for brunch this past Sunday & took my kids (ages 11 & 13) with me. We LOVED it. From the moment we were seated, we were well taken care of by the wait staff and our needs tended to a fare-thee-well.

The kiddos had fresh-squeezed orange juice (natch) and I had coffee (one of the coolest coffee presentations I've seen, by they way) and one of their handcrafted cocktails: the hot buttered Sazerac.

Lemme take a minute to talk about the crazy goodness of this drink. It was mellower than a traditional Sazerac, but packed all the same, smooth, magnificent punch as anything you'd find in New Orleans. But on a day when it was damp, cold, and entirely too wintry outside, this drink's warmth was just the ticket. LOVED it.

Our entrees were terrific. My daughter had Eggs Benedict which was "on fleek" and my son, their signature burger, which he reported was "the noms," as his eyes rolled back into his head. I had cornmeal pancakes with fresh blueberry conserve (and a few slices of bacon, to boot) that were fantastic. Not too sweet; just sweet enough.

The only thing holding me back from giving the 5th star in the review here is that we were seated at the tiniest of tables (and we *did* have a reservation), so there was scarcely enough room on it for all our food.

But, hey. First world problems, right?

Bar Marco is GREAT and we'll definitely be back.. Justin Benson is amazing! Extremely happy with our experience.  Prior to settling in with our Agent Justin with John Glutch we had gone through 2 other agents and had horrible experiences. We were very open and honest with him about what we had been through and what we wanted. I met all of the agents in their organization and was extremely impressed with all of them. Our main agent Justin Benson went over and above at all times and never left a detail out. He was extremely thorough and was great with any questions I had. We recommend John Glutch agency and our agent Justin Benson 500%. Jorge and his team do fabulous work. We use them for all our car tinting projects and they do superior work. Jorge's new auto body shop is outstanding! They did a complete , deep clean detail on our new used Lexus SC430 -- it looks brand new. Literally brand new. Jorge is a true professional in a field that is not known for professionalism. Plus he's a super nice guy. I can't recommend him and his business enough. Thanks!. I didn't like sushi until I went here. Our family LOVES this place, and everyone we bring here is hooked. You can't go wrong with Akai Hana, the sushi is the best in town and the prices are zoo cheep. Go during happy hour (12-2 and 8-10pm) My favorite rolls: The Blue Flame is by far the best one, very addictive. Love their California Rolls, The Las Vegas-wonderful. Another great roll is the Golden Buddah. My kids don't like sushi but they love getting the chicken Tatsuta. Also they have tempura cheesecake-one of the best desserts, sometimes we go there just for that.. I Loved my vegan eggs Benedict --- it was good enough to inspire me to return to Vegas. Brandy was our waiter she was so kind.. It's a gas station, nothing out of the ordinary here. But since I really only use this gas station out of the ones in my area, I'm going to review it. 

This Rebel is convenient to me and a location I pass almost every time I'm going somewhere. You can get to it easily, it has plenty of pumps, decent customer service, low prices and they easily have the best fountain drink selection around. Occasionally a pump is out of order or they have a long line inside for drinks, but I don't have much to complain about! I like the Blockbuster Express outside for something different when Redbox doesn't have the movie I want. 

The combination of reasons to go here is just enough to make it my regular gas station of choice. The only reason I go somewhere else is because I'm not near this one.. Got on a guestlist for hubby's birthday. Didn't wait in line and didn't pay cover. So far so good. Met some dope people from Alaska- made fun of Sara Palin- turns out they weren't fond of her either.

We made our way to the patio where, turns out, we spent the entire night. We met a bartender named Tony who provided EXCELLENT service- often bypassing other customers to check on us. Sorry if you were one of those other customers!! 

I can't really comment on the decor- I didn't see ANYTHING that screamed Ed Hardy or Audigier...weird. It was really dark though.

The two things that I didn't dig, however, were the lack of bathrooms inside the club. Come on now. In, out, in, out, all night. Also, one of the "suits" almost took away my camera because he saw me taking a video...of myself and hubby dancing to "Closer" by Ne-Yo. Not sure what FCC rules I'm breaking but whatev.

We got on Tony's guest list for the next night but hubby was out of commission for the entire next day. Guess that means we enjoyed our time at Audigier!. I am a big fan of Mi Patio ... the food is extremely reasonably priced and they always have specials on beers and margaritas.

What is most important for me is that they have a ton of vegetarian options. The beans are veggie friendly, so they have multiple choices from bean burros to taco salads to quesedillas to veggie burros... etc etc

The service is always really good to. The chips and salsa are provided immediately, and they food is always out pretty quick.

This place is certainly not upscale, but perfect if you want some good mexican food and a place to chill out.. I visited this restaurant a few weeks ago w a girlfriend for lunch and we both really enjoyed our meal.  The waiter was super sweet and the food was very tasty.  

I returned last night with my family and again we all had a really nice experience.  If you are looking for tasty  Mexican food check out this place. I'm basing this on only one experience at lunch, but it was excellent!

I was having lunch by myself at the end of a weekend with friends in vegas before heading to airport, and decided to hit Border Grill since I hadn't been there before and it was close (we stayed at THEhotel).  

At the server's suggestion, I had the daily special chicken and fruit salad.   I had been thinking I was in the mood for more traditional mexican, but he spoke so highly of the salad that I went with his recommendation.   And, I was SO glad i did! 

It had a great combination of flavors - peaches, nectarines, mangoes, black cherries, spicy sunflower seeds, marinated chicken, and boston lettuce all with an apricot jalapeno dressing.   YUM!  

The service was also very attentive, with multiple folks checking up on me regularly.  

It was only one experience, but based on that one time, I will certainly try it again next time I'm in vegas.   I hope they add that salad to their normal menu!. After reading these reviews, I simply had to give Bingo a try. How hard could it be, right? Well, reality check, Vegas Bingo is not what you played in preschool. This game takes total concentration (unless you use the digital reader, like a wussy) and there is no talking! It took me a few games to figure out what was going on but once I did, I was hooked. The best strategy is to get there early order 2-3 drinks and make sure you have cards for each game in the round. DO NOT call Bingo unless you are certain, the blue hairs almost killed one of their own after he mistakenly called Bingo, yikes!! To some it up: Bingo - it's intense and low-rewarding, but it's a damn good way to waste an hour in Vegas.. I just bought a house, the inspection didn't turn up any termites, so I figured I was ok when it came to bugs.  Well when I was painting a room and took off the outlet covers I discovered little black specks that could only be one thing... bug poop.  I'm not super squeamish about bugs, but a big pile of poop in the wall is not ok, and where there is poop, there are things that made it. I scanned Yelp for reviews and came across Lights Out--the reviews were all great so I gave Jason a call.  

I told him about my poop discovery and he knew right away what we were dealing with--crickets! Seriously, I came from another state and never considered them as a an issue before.  He was able to set an appointment for that weekend and came out.  Good thing he did, I had black widows and roaches too.  

He has a special spray that gets the bugs out of the walls and kills them. It was kind of exciting watching the crickets, spiders, and roaches scurry out and away.  Jason really knows his bugs and how to get rid of them, he even offered advice on what I can do to keep them from coming back into the walls.  He even offered my sister advice on how to bug proof her apartment.  

He let me know that when I get ready to do some landscaping he would be happy to give me advice on plants etc. so that I don't encourage the bug problem.

His prices were fair and he was knowledgeable and professional, when I notice bugs creeping back in he'll be the one I call.. Best nail salon ever. I have been going to Traci for a long time and she always does an amazing job. Her and her brother recently became the new owners of TIP TOE. The salon is clean and it's has an awesome atmosphere. Traci is amazing at nails. She's a true artist. I usually give Traci a couple colors I like as well as a few ideas and the nail designs she comes up with and phenomenal. I always get compliments :). I moved to Arizona in November 2009 and missed all the spa services I was getting in northern California. I scheduled a massage and a brazilian wax during a spa day with my sister and her best friend. The first time massage for a non-member is $49 and the summer special for a brazilian wax is $39 so it's easy to maintain it during the hot months.

I highly recommend Andrea for the massage. She intuitively applied the right amount of pressure and doesn't make you feel like she's rushing through the massage. 

Maya is very professional and personable,   I felt comfortable talking with her during the waxing service. She is also very thorough asking you to check if she missed any spots so you get a chance to check everything out before you leave. I never get home to discover any spots need more attention because it's all done at the spa. They also send you home with a packet of Finipil which slows hair regrowth and is antibacterial, it also has a 'cooling' feeling. 

Love the ladies at Fuchsia, if you get a Shellac mani/pedi ask for Jenna. The extra cost for Shellac gel polish is completely worth it. I had my nails painted with the Shellac polish for my friend's wedding and being a bridesmaid, we of course had a couple hundred favors to make, plus put labels on water bottles. A regular mani would have been destroyed but my nails looked as if they had been polished that morning. We were also on the beach and my shellac pedi managed to survive the sand, plus hours of dancing without showing any wear. I found I could go longer with the Negligee color because it's a nude shade but pushing it by going 2.5 weeks with the Fedora (dark purple) or the red colors. This is only because you see my nails growing, not because the gel color is chipping. I'm very impressed, I've gone to a different spot to try to save money but the gel polish at the OTHER place chipped after a weekend in Vegas.. This is the second time coming to binks. Their servers and waitstaff are exceptional and the food is amazing. 

We alway get a couple apps and meals to share so we can try all the different flavors. 

You won't be sorry for visiting this restaurant. We have had a great experience both times we have visited.. We had a wonderful time! It was perfect!. LOVED the helicopter tour - it's like flying in a comfy barcalounger. You don't even really notice you're taking off - one moment you're on the ground, next you're cruising down and over the runway. 

The ride feels a bit short - especially after the anticipation - but is really pretty excellent and gets you all the sights of the strip. Our pilot was great!

Yes, FAA regulations mandate no photos on the tarmac (big whoop) - and please - don't be the idiot in the helicopter who regularly takes a flash photo despite being told repeatedly not to (I'm looking at you, woman seated next to me - don't make me elbow you again!). The view really, truly can't be beat.

Warnings - you may not get to sit next to the person you book with - the pilot will divvy up where people sit based on weight. Your champagne is at the counter when you check in, and finish it before you go out the door. Lastly - we went on Friday, November 1st - which Maverick now concludes falls in the "off season" for Vegas. As such, we did not get a limo - they're doing a trial run where they pick you up in what is essentially a short bus. *Sad trombone* It's a trial basis, so they may bring back the limos year round - but we were sorta bummed about that.. Really like it .... First you order what kind of taco , burrito , bowl etc... In different line then after you can pay at the cashier . I like that its fresh  really love the corn !!!!. Great stop for lunch in downtown Main in Mesa. The staff is always friendly and the pizza is always good.. Enjoyed everything I ate, despite the fact that I am a very picky eater..  By far the best Korean BBQ ribs EVER..  And if you take your food home, it'll still be really tasty warmed up the next day, per my roommate..  Friendly staff, fast service..  Will definitely go back... I used to get all my routine car care here and they always did a good job and charged very reasonable rates.  The work always completed on time.  I only had them do oil changes, tires, flush and fills, etc.  The guys were nice enough, but it was the overall experience that brought me back.. Went here for lunch and was disappointed to find a limited menu, but every bite we had was quite delicious.  Ample parking behind restaurant.  Excellent service.  Loved the kimchi!  Looking forward to trying dinner and some cocktails next time.. I am giving a 5 star review mostly for the service. I had probably the best server here than anywhere I've ever been. You have a diamond there named Tori. She really was terrific. 
The food I'll give 4 stars. I had the antipasti and it was good but the peppers were way to sour and I love salty sour. The bbq nuts were pretty good as was the salami. I also had the meatloaf sandwich. It was tender and juicy and pretty good. It wasn't heavy like a lot of meatloaf is.
I'd go back to try something else and hope I get Tori as my server.. So satisfied! Relaxed clean atmosphere. Friendly, efficient, knowledgeable staff. The food was fresh and flavorful and in perfect filling proportions. The beet salad is a must try! Pair everything with the house made ginger lemonade! Definitely planning on returning.. Thanks, Wild!. Delish!   Go hungry and don't order to much. My husband and I ordered the Kobe sliders & pork belly for  appetizer's.  Yum! For dinner we both ordered the beef wellington and omg so yummy. HUGE portion and we both got a side (baked potato is the size of my fore arm and the Mac & cheese super yummy),  we had so much in leftovers crazy!  No room for dessert but maybe we will go back tonight .  We had a 9pm reservation and were a bit nervous about dress code but we wore nice jeans and fit in just fine.. I vacationed in Las Vegas this past week and was looking for a good salon to get my hair highlighted and styled. I found Elba through Groupon and was impressed by her friendly personality, adorable salon, and reasonable prices. My highlights turned out fantastic! She provided refreshments, was easy to converse with, and did a remarkable job. When I'm back in Vegas, I will definitely return to the Salon of Elba...whether my hair really needs a cut or not! ;). This location has the Lion House Pantry/Bakery and O-M-Gosh, you have to try the cherry pie. The. Best. I've. Ever. Had. Period. The staff is always friendly & the food is phenomenal!. We just recently moved out of our rental because the owner was moving back into town and was planning on living in the house. We had our walk through last Thursday and just received our deposit back today (a little over a week later). We received the full deposit back. We cleaned the house immaculately but were expecting some deductions for paint touch up and some slight wall damage. However, the owner of the house is planning on redoing everything and decided not to charge us anything. 
On another note because we were so happy with the service we had been receiving from SWG we decided to use them for a home we own in Henderson. They have been our property management company for that house for almost 3 years and we  have never had any problems.. You don't have to break it down to Shila how you want you want your brows, tell her how you want them and it is ON POINT. She does an amazing job! Not to mention her prices are worth it. If you're looking to get your brows threaded this is the place! I'm not one to write reviews but this place is well worth it!. Guess it's about time for me to write a review about this place.

Don't know much what to say though. It's got good food. It's got good beer. It's got shuffleboard.

I'm a big fan of their soup and sandwich combination, if I'm in the mood for something lighter. I usually get the tomato soup with the chicken salad sandwich. I also love the chicken pot pie (mmm, comfort food). Cheese curds - I have to say are not my favorite in Madison; too much breading. I'd say similar for their burgers - good but not the best. Loaded fries and spinach/artichoke dip are both tasty appetizers.

Service: always friendly.
Environment: It's nice that the bar is very separate from the restaurant. Makes it nicer to just have drinks or to have dinner.. Hambone's is divided into two sections. The restaurant area in the back serves pub-grub like wings, burgers, "hamwiches" and most everything else that's fried or dunked in ranch. Like most pub-grub it's something to eat, not a brush with culinary genius. 

The bar carries interesting local brews on tap like Rowhouse Red (from Philadelphia) and a couple unusual varieties of Yuengling. However, the best way to illustrate why you need to go to Hambone's at least once in your life is this story.

Man to bartender, "I need six shots of Jager!"

Bartender, "We ran out."

Man (huge incredulous sigh of exasperation), "Out of Jager?!" 

Bartender, "We ran out 10 minutes ago--sorry!"

Man, "Alright...gimme six shots of Rumple Mintze!"

Bartender, "We got Rumple Minze!". They took me on a walk in. Great pricing, super friendly staff, and my girl did a nice job. Got a fill and gel polish with hearts for valentines day for $33. Can't complain about that!. Well, this is a weird review to write.  Up until this weekend, I had never even used a shotgun and now here I am the first to review the Ben Avery Shooting Range.  Who knew? My husband recently acquired not one, but two guns - a shotgun and a pistol - much to my dismay.  But, they were here to stay, so I decided to be proactive and learn how to use them.  

The shooting range is on the way to Pleasant, right off the Carefree Highway.  I had passed by the place a hundred times on my way to the lake but had never stopped. There are 2 parts to the range, the target practice and the clay target area, a minute up the road.  We first stopped at the target practice area where $5 will cover your daily shooter fee.  This area is the more popular of the two and is VERY loud. Earplugs are necessary and noise canceling headphones couldn't hurt. We didn't end up staying at this area because we had come for clay shooting and I can't say I was disappointed to get out of there. 

$25 will get you a round of 100 sporting clays.  Each platform has two sporting clay machines that either shoot them high, low or doubles.  At first I was apprehensive, but by the end I was loading the gun and actually enjoying myself.  I ended up shooting 2 out of 10 sporting clays and I have to say I was pretty proud of myself at 20% for my first time. 

Sunblock, earplugs and water are necessary - lots of water, it is in the middle of the desert and the sun is a killer.  The staff is friendly and helpful; one employee even stopped by our area and offered us water. 

I can't say this is a new hobby of mine, but I'll be back every now and then to freshen up and practice.. Everything was great!   Portions were good, huge variety of quality food & service was excellent.  We had a variety of kushiage (small fried items), sushi & udon.  Everything was fresh & great quality.  Yuzu sorbet is also great & refreshing end to a meal!. I chose the rib dinner which was a half rack with a choice of potato and salad or soup. The salad was okay a few of the leaves were lacking color but the veggies were really good inside of the salad. The half rack of ribs we're very tasty and the meat fell right off the bone didn't even need to fight it with a knife. The sauce was had a tangy sweet taste and the garlic mashed potatoes we're okay. I don't think I'll go back for the garlic mashed but I will go back for the ribs or anything else that was in the reviews before me. I did get a dessert to go the chocolate pudding cake but I haven't tried it yet. Service was good there were TVs around to keep track of the sports or you could talk with others. It was not so noisy so you can hear each other. Amazing how I pass by this everyday on my way to work and I've never come here. Now I know I can come here with confidence.. Located in the target plaza tucked away in the very corner, this is a solid spot to get any accessory you need. I needed a lanyard for my work keys since my old one broke. I asked the sales clerk where they would be and she pointed me to the selection they had. There were a few but for $10 each, I wasn't loving any design. After wondering around the clearance section, I found one that had "adorkable" written on it and was on sale for $2!!! Score!! They had a ton of cute wallets, necklaces and clutches as well!! I'll definitely be back if I'm in need of a quick accessory.. I've been here a few times. The quality of the food was honestly not as good as the Italian joint I had dinner at in the theater district of Manhattan, but I'm not some Yelp snob who complains about places not being "authentic" enough when I've never been to Italy in the first place. The owner has a very lively New Yorker-ish personality and a booming voice. He greets you, takes your order, and is overall a very friendly guy who treats all of the customers well. If this guy ever treats you like crap, then there must be a serious glitch in the system. Everything I've tried here came out pretty quickly, even when there were other large groups of customers, and everything tasted fine. My eggplant parm was also incredibly big for a lunch-sized serving. Overall, it's a neat little lunch place if you happen to be over in that area. Hopefully it manages to stay open longer than the other places that occupied this spot.. I just got my hair done by ELLICE last week and I'm in love with it the color is just what I wanted she took her time and was very professional and clean, she also aded layers to my extensions. 

The salon is very modern nice colors and very organized and clean ! 

I will deff be going be back to her to go lighter in a month.. I love this place. I only found it in the last year when I went to this little shopping center with my mom to buy bathing suits. I have found some really great books here and have expanded my collection immensely because of it. I usually have to be prepared that I am going to buy a lot of books for a really good price. 

I haven't tried selling my books here yet so I am unsure of that experience yet.. Great lunch specials, good food.  When we arrived for lunch, the restaurant was clean and we were well taken care of by the staff.  They were attentive and our food came out quickly.  We will be back!. My brother told me about this place. He said "You must have the stuffed dates". They are a must! Ever since I was stationed in Panama with my husband, I have searched for good empanadas. OMG!! I finally found them! This place is one of the best food places in Vegas. The food is cooked to order and served very hot. I ordered the red Sangria and it is incredibly delicious. I recommend ordering a pitcher. The fresh bits of apple are so good.  My favorites on the menu are the dates, empanadas and lamb chops. They season the chops perfectly with a wonderful sear on them. They melt in your mouth. Their garlic fries are addicting.They are open late and service is amazing. Every time I am in Vegas, this place is always on my list. It's busy but a romantic place. It's a tapas bar, so you can try lots of food and not spend lots of money. Every mouthful of food is an experience and it makes you want to come back again and again. Thanks brother! You got this one really right!. Booked the room on Priceline for our anniversary getaway.  2 days before we were to leave I called to check on the reservation.  I was transferred to the, hands down, single most rude man in customer service.  He told me to call back when there were not kids in the background and when I had my reservation number because he didn't want to look it up by last name.  I called the hotel and asked to speak to a manager.  She was wonderful and apologized and I felt better about staying there, knowing that not everyone was as rude as that man.

We checked in and the man at the desk wished us a happy anniversary and informed us that we would be staying in the honeymoon sweet and had access to the concierge floor and snacks were being served.  Every time we saw him that night he asked if there was anything that he could do to make our stay better.  What a surprise and proof that good customer service does exist!  

The bedding was very nice and the housekeeping staff was always so nice.

We had a wonderful time and we will stay there again!. Ohhh Cousins. You never cease to make me happy. I moved here from Wisconsin a couple years ago and I was surprised that there weren't any Cousins. This location is really great! They have Sprecher root beer (which I can only find in WI)! My favorite is the roast beef sub with the french fries-which you can subsititue for chips at no cost! The place is really clean and the staff is very friendly! We met the owner, who was very nice! He is also from Wisconsin, which is pretty cool!. This is such a cool little shop and is a must-stop for foodies and cooks. As a food lover and style buff, I just love the interior design of this place. The decor is beautiful and the shop is well laid out. The vinegar wall is something of a visual marvel that's worth a look even if you aren't in the market to buy anything. 

This is a great place to buy a housewarming or hostess gift. The employees are always super friendly and knowledgeable and they'll help you put together a nice basket. My husband sometimes buys his corporate gifts here because they look nice and the staff will work with you to fix gifts that fit your budget.

Unlike some other shops, the employees here seem eager for you to try all of the free samples of their products -- you'll never be made to feel like a freeloader here, they are encouraging when it comes to trying and trying and trying all of the samples. 

There are some nice, high end olive oils and vinegars but the shop also sells some interesting spice blends, dried pasta, sauces, jams and chocolates. The dried spices are good (try the Zulu Africa mix) but the selection is limited (don't come here expecting a Penzey's or anything). Great spot to shop for nice kitchen oils.. I am a true believer in supporting neighborhood restaurants. This one is within biking distance, so I hope to frequent it more in the future. We went for dinner on a Friday night and the restaurant was not even 1/2 full, which is a such a shame because the inside is gorgeous and the food was great. I ordered the pan roasted breast of free-range chicken. It came with a mushroom dressing, pearl onions and garlic mashed potatoes. The serving was not huge, but it was filling. I  liked the combinations of flavors in the dish. My husband had the grilled vegetable and roasted tomato lasagna. I tried the lasagna and didn't like the texture; it was a bit dry. It took a while for our food to come out, but we weren't really in any rush. We had a great server; very attentive. I really want to go back for breakfast or brunch. This is a great restaurant to take a small group of friends for dinner on the weekend!. Francesca is phenomenal.  She did my hair and makeup for my husband and my elopement.  She immediately "got" the vintage look I wanted even though I was not good at describing it.  She was so sweet and kind and my hair and makeup was perfect.  I cannot recommend her highly enough. If you're looking for a succulent burger then I definitely recommend Gourmet Burger Kitchen, even the name is more inviting than other burger joints and you won't be disappointed by the quality or the service here. 

I love a good burger now and again, it has to be my favourite comfort food, especially partnered with a side of piping hot chippies. 

Everything on the menu was appealing to me so I really struggled with what to go for, so much so that it probably took a good 15 minutes before I finally made up my mind. In addition to regular beef burgers they also had a great selection of chicken burgers and vegetarian options too. I finally decided to go for the "Mexican" burger which was delicious and absolutely massive, I was absolutely full to bursting after I'd polished it off. 

For the size of the burgers I think they charge a reasonable price and if you're looking for comfort food that is slightly more adventurous than your average burger, give this place a whirl.. I'm pretty sure you will be happy with your experience at this spa/salon.  Sophia offers full services and one stop shopping.  she did perm makeup for me a week ago and I am delighted with the results.  She is really friendly and professional and clean as well.  I recommend this shop and I will return when I am next in Las Vegas.. GORGEOUS hotel.
GORGEOUS lobby
GORGEOUS tea area
GORGEOUS restaurants
GORGEOUS rooms
GORGEOUS hallways
hahaha.  ok ok.  totally love this hotel. was able to stay here on company's dime for a meeting that we had at MO.  service was superb from before we arrives, during the trip and after we left.  follow up and follow thru.  hotel room was spotless, beautiful and just all around NICE.  no casino, no smoke smell, no rush of ppl in and out.  even at valet and taxi area, we did not encounter a long line.  the guys at the lobby and taxi remembered us and we were only there for 3days, 2 nights.  
just perfect all around!  will definitely come back.. Our family loves this place. The food is amazing and they're very nice there. So so good!. Amazing food, drinks, and the best service! Besides our awesome server, two other employees came by to shoot the breeze with us. You can tell everyone is happy to be there, and it was such a fun experience to escape the Strip and eat high quality, creative food without having to pay a fortune. Their rootbeer glazed pork sliders were the best thing I've ever had. The duck confit flatbread with fig jam and Gorgonzola was fantastic. The beef Wellington empanadas were served with a red wine reduction and I absolutely loved them. We topped off the night with a bourbon brownie served with bacon butter cream Ice cream. We wanted to eat everything on the menu, and we know we will be back next time we are in town. As a tourist, it was nice to come to an actual foodie place, and then hop over to Fremont street to walk off all of the amazing comfort food. Plates are smaller- like tapas style, and they make for a great date/small party. My favorite part is that you will most likely be sitting a community table or a bar that faces the staff. This setup enhances the fun experience by forcing you to engage with everyone around you. We eat at a lot of fun places in Denver and Chicago, and I must say this has been one of the best experiences I've had in a long time. The best part- our bill was waaaaay lower than expected! They had such thoughtful touches, too- our bill was served in an old book!. Very nice friendly service. They werent clear about when they are coming to drop off my laundry and also they left some items behind but they solved problems pretty quickly and the most importantly the laundries were clean and nicely folded and very well delivered. I definately recommend this place.. sweet and nice!!. I think this is my new favorite Italian restaurant!  The service and food were amazing!!! We had a 3 course meal and it was all perfect.  I loved the calamari (not overly fried or breaded).  The manager had a great knowledge of the wines they had available and the wine list was also impressive.  I have not tried their 'backdoor pizza'  but I intend on trying it soon!  If it is anything like the food in the restaurant, I am sure it will be awesome.. Always great food... love the lamb chops and the beef rib.... yum.  Great salad bar too.  Service was good and Lou was great!  We went for lunch and did not need dinner later  ;). I cannot say enough about the customer service at Caliber. We worked with Matt Hurtado and what a great help he was. They totally rebuilt my Honda Pilot and he was so helpful along the way. We had a few little issues after the big repair, and I was able to call Matt & immediately get my car in for service and the issue was fixed. Thank you!. I met Lindsey a couple years ago when she was working at another waxing studio. She has wonderful prices and in located in a great area. But most of all she makes you feel comfortable!  I would recommend her to everyone!. This is my favorite dim sum place in town. Every time I have gone, the service & the food have been great. It's reasonably priced and a wide variety of generous portions. Highly recommend.. PROS:

1. The food is rich, succulent, and an experience. The memorable dishes were:
the Foie Gras Comesquis which are basically fried balls of foie gras that explode (literally) in your mouth. If you like foie gras, this is the starter for you! 

Second: the Plogue a Champlain. This was probably my favorite thing we tried. The sweetness of the maple syrup and the saltiness of foie gras and meat all combined was to die for! 

2. The decor suits the food (warm/rich) and I liked how you could see the kitchen from the dining area. 

3. Service was classy and they recommended great dishes for us. However, the restaurant made my reservation on the wrong day. So we showed up and were told it was a no-go but since I did make the reservation and swore I made it the right day, they gave us a table. phew!

CONS:

1. It's quite pricey but in this case, you get what you pay for :) !

2. You need to make reservations like a week in advance. 

OVERALL:
-It's a great place for foie gras and to indulge in outrageously heavy, rich, delightful food. 
-It's a place to go at least once. I don't think I will go again just because I'm not THAT big a fan of foie gras.. While in Vegas for The Cosmopolitan's opening week, we decided to stay a couple nights at the Vdara to size up the competition. Personally, I loved the rooms here more than The Cosmopolitan's (TC) Terrace Suite.

Room: Though everything else at TC was stunning, the room design was inconsistent and seemed confused about what it wanted to be. At Vdara, it didn't try to be anything more than gloriously contemporary, modern and chic with clean lines, great lighting and technology-galore.

Pluses: Everything works on a master remote control from the multiple window screens that change how much light you want in your room to the flat screens (2!). All the accent lighting are on dimmers for a more romantic feel. The room maximize every square inch space, so even though it's half the size of the TC suite, the Vdara room felt just as spacious. The bathroom was massive with a frameless glass shower, soaking tub and dual sinks. Views were on par with the view from the TC. 

Minuses: Unlike TC, aside from the rooms, Vdara doesn't really have anything else going on. It was pretty dead--save for one sad little bar by the entrance. We even saw someone napping on the floor of the lobby with their luggage. After a week in Vegas, the consensus was pretty unanimous for the Vdara room--and The Cosmopolitan's amenities.. I've had a good first experience at the stand! Their food is all fresh, made to order. I love that. The menu is simple and to the point, with a few extra ingredients like caramelized onions and grilled jalapeño for flair on your burger. I have yet to try the tacos but I will definitely be back to do so. Staff at the stand is friendly, without being fake. My only miss on this place is that there's no cheddar cheese...only American. Give this place a whirl and definitely get the fresh lemonade!. I love seafood.  If it were legal I'd probably want to marry some oysters or a lobster or something.  First of all, this place is on Restaurant.com.  Yay coupons!  So with my super cheap $25 gift certificate the bf and I went for dinner.  We started out with the oyster sampler.  They were super fresh and so darn tasty.  We got some bread which they graciously refilled for us.  I had the scallops and the bf had something I can't quite remember.  We also ordered the cheese mashed potatoes and BBQ pork mac and cheese sides.  It was a ton of food but everything was delicious and the service was really great.  I think the only bad thing about the meal was that I was too full for dessert : (. With its very friendly staff, and cheap drinks and food, this is a popular city centre bar. There is a large selection of lagers, pints and you can buy the wine by the bottle. There is also something for everyone here  on a Friday night they had a fantastic live band playing some great tunes (the kind you can't help but tap your feet and dance in your seat to), as well as having two channels of sport playing (on mute) on the screens around the bar. A perfect place for work drinks, or meeting up with a group of friends! Only down side here is that the toilets occasionally seem in need of cleaning or having the paper stocks replenished But the ambience is great, and the prices are right, so I for one am willing to look over that for now.. Second time here and it was even better than the first. We were a group of 4 and sat outside on the patio. Our server was Lyndsie and she was friendly & engaging, offering her advice about the menu. Let me just say the tomato basil soup was the best I've ever had, crazy good flavor and cheesy goodness on the bread accompanying. The flatbread pizzas were a definite hit, especially the mushroom. Flavorful is the best way to describe all the food we had and I highly recommend eating here when visiting the Arts Factory, great food, service & menu.. It was only two or three weeks ago that Lee told me she was working on licensing to expand, so it came as a sad surprise to read on FB today that she decided to sell the business AND close shop.  The status update mentioned that the flavors will soon make their way to grocery freezers, but not even the pretty and kind Gina knew about this when I stopped by at the shop this afternoon*.  [I had plans to go from massage to happy hour at a new place (to me!) when I decided I'd stop by and speak to someone at the shop itself about the sad news...]

Doors close tomorrow evening at 7 pm, so hurry and stock up on your favorite flavors!  Psst!  The Red Velvet Scotch was tasty!  (The cake's recipe is one of Paula Deen's.)  The flavor was a tad sweet, perhaps, but I definitely could discern the scotch and red velvety treasure there.  Plus, it's so pretty!!  :)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lees-cream-liqueur-scottsdale?select=I5PSw4fpFZdIWCG_3wkbng#I5PSw4fpFZdIWCG_3wkbng

For those who have unused gift cards and would like to get a refund, please visit Lee's Cream Liqueur's FB site to get more info.. this is as good as it gets in vegas, baby. it's a brand-spanking new, stiletto'ed glam-fab casino on the strip. it's the jimmy choo of casinos if they were shoes.

Key Points
1. service is pretty flawless. it's almost like being waited on by management consultants because they are constantly coming up with solutions to best serve you or answer a question. not the usual robotic, yes/no responses. oh and when you hit "beck and call" on the phone, a smart, polite, amicable person picks up within 1 ring.

2. the restaurants on the 3rd floor are all super expensive. all of them. i mean like $36/dish expensive. but pretty stunning selection.

3. billing and estimation is HORRENDOUS. although I booked through "a third party" (priceline) i got 4 or 5 different interpretations of my bill.  some people said there would be 12% on top, others said not. we got so many mini bar charges that were reversed. i'm pretty sure they do that just to smoke & mirror you. oh and it's been a week since i got back and i STILL haven't gotten the bill emailed to me. 

4. Location could be better. a couple ppl commented that it's not as central as Bellagio and Caesar's.

5. Decor is gorgeous. It's more of a fashion experiment in art-deco, glam, accessory-mania, glitterati kaleidescop-ism. an oasis from the disney-themed or italian/roman-themed casinos LV is beating the crap out of.

6. i have to comment on the music in the elevator, downstairs lobby, and Holsteins. whoever chose that music is my lover. and my savior amidst the mind-numbing euro-trash club techno. DEPECHE MODE? JUNIOR BOYS? SPOON? NEW ORDER? i wanted to curl up in that psychedelic elevator the whole trip and be mind-massaged by all the music i love. CALL ME. WE WILL MAKE BEAUTIFUL MUSICAL BABIES TOGETHER. WE WERE MEANT TO BE.

ciao. Great store and excellent brand. I was really considering the mini Atlantique, but didn't see a color combo that was worth the splurge, nonetheless their bags are the perfect combination of practical, minimal and  aesthetic. It's also great that they don't have giant logos ( e.g: LV, MK or Coach) splattered all over the fabric. The store was cool, and the salespeople were funny. They were not pushy, and they knew a lot about the bags and what colors the company was going to come up with for the next season. 
Sad the store is closed now :((((. Great. I think it's better than venezia's. This is my place now. The cake is good too. I like the buff chicken pizza. After a late night out with a few college buddies, we woke up @ the downtown Hyatt starving for a hearty meal.  Einstein Bro's Bagels located downstairs, wasn't gonna satisfy our insatiable craving for some rib-stickin, home cooked food.  

When we arrive, there are people milling about the exterior of this tiny restaurant, sipping orange infused water provided by the staff.  We assumed it must be excellent, if these people were willing to wait in the sweltering heat for a coveted seat.

After 15-20 minutes, we feel like celebrities on the VIP list as we're escorted through the door.  I order the Hog & Chick, which provided more than enough hash browns, eggs, toast, and sausage to quell the lumberjack appetite I developed.  

The staff was friendly & fast, attentive to our dwindling water glasses and clearing plates quickly.  We were more than pleased with the meal, hospitality and price point--happy to walk a little of this hearty breakfast off, on the way back to the hotel.. This is one of the nicest Walmarts I have shopped.  We went on Black Friday, mid-afternoon and with the exception of the electronics section, the place was pretty empty.  The fresh produce was really fresh, and we were surprised at how many wonderful items they stocked. The cashiers were friendly and the other store personnel quite helpful in guiding us throughout this new location.. One of the best exhibits I've been too.  They did a great job presenting interesting artfacts recovered from the Titanic grave site.  From the personal items left by passengers, individual letters written to family members pre-boarding, the sample "iceberg", to the piece of ship wreckage, I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  At the beginning, they give you a piece of paper with passenger information (each person in my party had a different passenger) on it - make sure you check the ship log before you exit to find out said passengers fate.  Such a terrible tradgedy - the exhibit does a good job of making you feel like you were there that night - what happened, what went one in the minds of the survivors.  A definite must see in Vegas!. Even an hour before they close, great donuts and fresh chicken is still available! I tried a slew of donuts... The Wisconsin, poppyseed lemon, lemon maple, glazed and rose meringue. My fave was the poppyseed lemon and Wisconsin. I think all the donuts plus an order of chicken came out to be a lil less than $20. My friend said its the best chicken she's ever had. In my opinion, it's def not thee best, but it's very good. 

I would like to come back and try the other donuts. I love this place. I always get the same thing though. I get the green pork chili nachos. AMAZING!! Love the environment and the atmosphere!!!!!. Friendly and knowledgeable staff! They even have a nutritionist on site which shows their dedication to promote healthy living! I think it's great that they make the food daily and have appropriate portion sizes.  I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 because they didn't have as many vegetarian/vegan meals as I would have liked. What I did purchase though tasted delicious! I look forward to going back and checking out their meals again!. We used Bell Limo on a whim to get home from the airport when the taxi line was just ridiculous. But now we're ruined, since we never want to take a taxi again! :-)

We took one of their SUVs and our two gigantic suitcases fit with room to spare (something that would never be possible in a taxi - our cases normally only fit if we can snag a van lol).

Our driver was Danielle Zellner and she was just awesome. So friendly, so knowledgeable and just an all around pleasure to drive around Vegas with :-) For sure ask for her if you're using Bell Limo - you'll have a smooth ride and a bunch of laughs along the way (the perfect way to start or end any trip imo).

Whether you're coming to Vegas on vacation, or just returning home, do yourself a favor, skip that awful taxi line and just reserve a ride with Danielle from Bell limo. It is so worth it!. In my opinion, going to the dentist is never on my list of things I want to do. However, I LOVE Gilbert Family Dentistry! Hands down I always have such a positive experience. Now, although I sill would rather spend my afternoon outside of the dental office, they make my experience great! 

Yesterday I had an appointment and the hygienist was able to squeeze me in a little early! What?!? I was so happy to get in on time for my appointment. Also, she kept me informed throughout the appointment and was able to thoroughly clean my teeth and schedule my appointment in a timely fashion!

Dr. Haslam is great and I strongly suggest you check out this dental office! They Rock!!. So everyone throws around the word "Shellac" like we do Kleenex and Tylenol when we may mean something broader like no chip nail polish, tissue or pain killer.  

Today, I learned that Shellac is just a brand of gel nail polish...perhaps this isn't news to anyone but me.  Apparently many other nail companies have their own version of "shellac".  

Examples: 
CND are the makers of Shellac
Harmony makes Gelish
OPI makes GelColor

Well here's better news, Envy carries such a wide variety of gel nail polish brands and colors that you'll be spending more time choosing a color than the manicure itself!  I was completely overwhelmed when selecting a color for my nails.  

And wait for it, wait for it, you can mix and match between brands.  I used an OPI color as my base color and chose a Harmony silvery glitter to go on top of that.  Results - bright pink with glitter on top that should last for 2 weeks, in other words -  perfection.  

The nail technicians are talented, patient, and precise - I was very impressed with the care they took while doing my nails.  They were friendly and efficient and the service was extremely affordable.  

I learned that there's a South Hills location in Mt. Lebo which I want to check out since that's closer to home for me.  

P.S. I made an appointment.  I can see how this place would get crowded in the evenings and weekends as there was a steady flow on a Thursday afternoon.. Let me begin by saying I hate buffets.  I don't want to eat a huge amount of food in a sitting and I don't like that the food is often basic and boring made to appeal to the masses.  So when I give Wicked Spoon 4 stars, that's crazy-high praise. And you'll see that I clearly had a totally ridiculous amount of food. And needed a big nap for the next few hours.

We stayed at the Cosmopolitan for 2 nights and were allowed to enter both mornings for free so we visited the breakfast buffet twice.  For Elite Marriott members, the hotel does not offer a club-level breakfast so this is the amazing concession.  

Got in line around 9:30A the first morning and it was a 20-30 minute wait.  Asked the cashier if we could go right in but were told we needed to wait in line.  No worries, but we did see others ask the same question and get seated right away.  Mentioned that the 2nd day since we got up a bit later and the line was a bit longer and the cashier said we were supposed to jump to the front of the line.  So, I guess it all depends upon who is working the register.

Both mornings, it took a while to be seen by a server for our drink order and our dirty plates were never removed until we left.  Seems they have way too many tables per server.  Service gets a 1(at best) and isn't factored in to the rating since it's a small part of the experience.

SO many choices.  I had read about the Red Velvet Pancakes and got one of those with some sour-creamy warm icing on the side. Turns out the pancake alone was dry and very boring.  Oops, forgot about that frosting which made it phenomenal.  What is in that stuff??!

They had 3 varieties of Eggs Benedict in adorable little individual pans.  I tried 2 different types the 2 different days and both were awesome.  One had a biscuit, one had tender pork, both I recommend.

Tons of fresh fruit.  I must have had half a plate of berries.  Yum, yum, yum.  Also small cups of different fruit smoothies.

Nice smoked salmon area with a few varieties and all the accoutrements.

Best thing on the entire buffet were the warm cinnamon buns.  My husband (who is not into sweets at breakfast AT ALL) agreed.

They have the chef making the custom omelets which always has a line in every buffet, the bacon and sausages, potatoes and a bazillion other items.

Turns out the items I had the first day, I pretty much repeated the next day because it was all terrific.. I LOVE it here! This gym really has something for everyone. From traditional cardio and weight equipment to basketball, racquetball, rock wall, and indoor and outdoor pools, no one could ever be bored here. Their cafe is great and they even have a spa. I could live here!. This is the same place I reviewed as O Yummy Sushi but with a new name!
http://www.yelp.com/biz/oyummy-sushi-and-roll-henderson#hrid:BDgVs4eT6tQIfmQOPqlF3w. We tried Pinky's for the first time this past week.  While the food was pretty good (better than average), it was the small town feel, the friendliness of the staff, and the old-time decor that drew us in.  It reminded me of a cafe that I worked at in high school.

I ordered the green chile-cheese omelette which was yummy!  The home fries weren't really hot but were tasty just the same.  My husband had the 2 egg-short stack of pancakes, and bacon breakfast.  The pancakes were HUGE...though again not as hot as they should have been.  They wouldn't melt the butter...but they were pretty good just the same.  Scrambled eggs were done perfectly and the bacon was thick and crispy.  Coffee cups were constantly topped off.

We will be back!. By far, the best chicken parmigiana my husband and I have had in Las Vegas.
We asked Chef Jason to make it a little crispy, and he did just that. We also had the meatball appetizer that was so tasty. We love that this is a family owned business, and have gotten to know the owners. We are warmly welcomed every returned visit. Last visit I had the Osso Buco special with homemade pasta, 3 good size pieces tasted like it was cooking for hours, tender and very tasty.. We had a great meal with fantastic service! Doug and Robert are conscientious and personable servers that time their appearance just when you need them! The manager came by twice to make sure all was well and indulge in some nice social chit-chat. 

First we ordered 2 cocktails- I had the bourbon smash (Black Beard?) and my fiancée ordered another new drink served in a martini glass. A good start....

Now, onto the food- a new (so I was told) appetizer was a bite on a French bread slice that had goat cheese, a green sauce (sorry, I forgot what it was), and some delish salami slices on top- very tasteful! Next, had some savory large chunk lobster bisque with a delightful twist of sliced fresh tomatoes and crispy green beans- if this combination sounds strange to you- all I can say is that you need to try it- it works! However, I like my soup hot, so let me suggest that you request it that way as my only criticism is that it was warm.

The lettuce wedge was refreshing and what I had expected. The main courses were the halibut (fresh) and bar-b-qued salmon. Both were flavorful and cooked to perfection. I had the halibut seared and chose the garlic ponzu sauce- which I highly recommend. My fiancée had the salmon and it came with a hash-type side dish- everything on his plate was eaten, enjoyed, with a statement of repeating the order next time come here. 

Last, but not least, the dessert! Cappacino lovers- make sure to order it to accompany your dessert, you won't regret it! The rolled chocolate cake has a raspberry filling in the center, the banana cream pie is full of fresh bananas, and the ice cream/sorbet literally melts in your mouth! A perfect way to end a perfect dinner!!!. Today was my first visit to 702 Nail Lounge.  I figured I would give them a try after reading there reviews on Yelp.  They were very nice on the phone when making my appointment, and were great when I got to the salon.  They helped pick out the perfect color, were able to correct an issue with a previous fill, and had a great organic pedicure.  Definitely would recommend and will be coming back again!!. I really love miss Francesca I have been coming to see her for a few years she never goes overboard and she will tell you what will look best on your face and what will be proportionate I love her I wish her all the success in the world she keeps me looking young and youthful. I just recently discovered Peters Yard and I wish I had found it sooner! They have lovely lose leaf tea that is rich and full bodied! And the pastries, each time I have been there I have not been disappointed.  This last time I got a raspberry linzer tart and it was amazing , with my last bite I was sad it was over. I think its a nice cozy cafe, and even provides blankets if you are cold and sitting outside . 
the savoury food looks amazing but I haven't had the chance to try it yet, hope to next time.. I enjoy this Mill Ave spot for a good brew after work. We typically come during happy hour and the seating is plentiful during that time. Love that they have seating at the bar outdoors and love even more that they have Stiegl on tap. My cousin got me on this German lager and I enjoy when I can find a place that serves it. Since we are normally at the bar the service is usually quick and they keep an eye on us. 

The last time I came was for a birthday party. It was one of those few chilly nights in Tempe and they had warned us we might be outside, but they had heaters. Turned out they were able to reserve a few tables inside, so that was a nice surprise. They assigned 1 main server to us, but also had 2 others with knowledge of the group and they did a wonderful job. 

I have only ever tried the fries and they were good, but I can't comment on the other food. Will have to give it a whirl sometime. This is a nice option for graduates or a working professional as it doesn't get overrun with young students.. We wanted t-shirts for a family trip... We had a very specific design that we wanted that needed altering and added artwork... We walked in and told the guy what we were thinking, he immediately started altering the images, quickly and perfectly. We had been to another screen printing place that had better yelp reviews the day before, but the girl there wasn't willing to spend the time and make the image what we wanted without a $50 "art fee" and she was rude and not helpful. Totally opposite experience at T Shirt Diner. Got our shirts the same day and they look amazing... Plus they're the same price we were going to pay the first place ($26) for way better quality and exactly what we wanted. So glad we went to T Shirt Diner!!. Love love love this place!!! Had a mani pedi party here for my ladies and they were so accommodating!! Aiden is amazing!!! Please if you haven't been here you must try!!!!. This is a wonderful yoga studio where you nourish not only your body, but your mind and soul as well. There are so many options of variety of classes and each instructor brings her own touch. So it never feels boring. 

When I'm in town, THIS is my second home.. Soooo worth the hunt! We got there about 10 min before they opened on sunday and so when we were looking for it the hallway was blocked off, which threw us off... But then we peaked behind the wall and saw the secret hallway! 

The directions from other yelpers was super helpful! Cosmo, 3rd floor, by the pool table and sushi place. one of the pizza makers peaked his head out and let us in right at 11am. 

The deliciousness could be smelled as we walked down the hallway... we were first in line, and within 5 min the place was pretty packed. my sister and I shared a cheese, pepperoni, white and meat lovers... All were amazing. I think the best though might have been the cheese. Flavor was great, greasy thin crust goodness. And I'm normally a deep dish girl. 

I brought 4 others with me and they all LOVED it. One actually got back in line for a third... And a canolli! normally I'm not a cannoli fan, but this one had super thick cream, almost a cheesecake consistency... Pretty good. But come for the pizza!

Love this place! Will make it a vegas tradition from now on!. This place was fantastic. The mole was perfect. I may venture all the way to arizona for lunch here again..... You need only one reason to come here: chili verde nachos.  The chili verde is too good.  It has my boyfriend and I driving 20 minutes there and back just for it. The tacos are good too from what I've tried.  The menu is kind of hard to follow at first and cluttered with tons of photos.  Probably why we stuck with what we knew in the beginning; but then we branched off to the "special items" listed next to the register.  Chili verde nachos is where it's at.  I crave these things constantly.  Melt in your mouth good... just beware of the hidden jalapenos in there if you are sensitive to spicy.. The first thing I ever had here was the onion soup velouté. The second thing was the same as the first. It was so nice, I had it twice.
The next time I ate here, it happened again.
I think I have a problem, but I do not want help.
Just more soup please.
The next time I came here they TOOK THE SOUP OFF THE MENU.
So I cried.
I'm not even lying.
The next visit to fleur, my onion soup was mysteriously BACK ON THE MENU.
apparently, I was not the only one who cried.
NOW
There is a NEW SOUP. 
Mexican street corn soup.
It is indescribable. 
If someone spilled a bowl of this soup on the floor of a New York City subway, I would lick it off the floor.
It wouldn't even have to be the last bowl on earth. Like, if we were together in the subway, and it was you who dropped your soup on the floor and I was still holding mine safe and sound, yes, I would still eat yours off the floor.
I don't think that I could pay it a higher compliment.
P.s.
The staff is very nice.. To call this place delicious would be an understatement. We had an omelet with prosciutto, mozzarella, mushroom and arugula as well as the crispy potato bowl with asparagus, Brussels sprouts and over easy eggs. Both were fantastic, and the homemade green salsa was the best I've tasted. 

Additionally, the setup of the restaurant was somehow both modern and charming. This is truly a can't miss breakfast spot, and I'm sure the other meals would be delicious here as well. Check it out!. This is by-far the best Thai place in Charlotte. I have visited both locations of the restaurant. However, I think the older establishment on East Blvd. has better food and service. Whenever my sister comes in town, we make sure to visit Thai Taste. It's become a tradition!

Love the Pud Thai!. So I had a business dinner here last night. Had never been to Taggia nor Firesky. Loved the ambiance first of all. Perfect for this time of year! 

Our waiter, Cain, was awesome. Super attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. I asked him for recommendations and he almost named the whole menu! We ended up ordering the Burrata, Calamari and the Gnocchi as appetizers for 6 of us. They were all incredible. Especially the Burrata. I've had grilled Calamari before and it was tasteless and chewy....but this was not. Super flavorful and tender. So good!!

For dinner I had the Capesante. The pairing of the sweet potato puree (I hope thats what it was), roasted sweet corn and the saltiness of the perfectly seared scallops was amazing! The avocado relish was a great addition as well. Im so going to master this dish on my own and add it to my favorites!! 

Cheers to the staff and the Chef. I will be back!. I would come back here for their frozen hot chocolates alone. They're kiinda expensive, but worth it once you're having it. They're over $10 for sure. You can pick form a handful of frozen hot chocolates and I doubt you can go wrong with any of them.

When I went here, I made reservations but it looked like I didn't need to. We got here on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't really busy. After ordering, we got our food pretty fast and we were all a little shocked to see how huge the portions were. We were just expecting overpriced, normal sized food. 

All in Nachos: Meh. Nothing special. You should probably ask for the cheese to be a little more melted, otherwise you're not really getting what you're asking for. They served it to us a little cold which made everything taste...not so great.

LV Steak Sandwich: Skip this. It's really not worth it. The "steak" is super chewy and tastes extremely bland. They could've at least marinated it or made it a little more tender. Soo disappointed with this dish. It had so much potential.

I think we all know people come here for their frozen hot chocolate. I now know there's a reason for that. Everything else on their menu is just not up to par. Maybe if you're drunk though?. Such a rad bar. Huge, huuuuuuge, with seemingly disparate themes for each section - but they're all gorgeous and comfy, so it's like drunken treasure hunting, seeing each room's details and decor. 

The ceiling is carpeted in lamps, which are used to signal Last Call. Awesome.

There's a huge projection screen, which is often showing Thriller. Also awesome.

There's a decent selection of tap beers leaning a little towards the domestic, priced reasonably, and a full bar with fancy drinks and specials every night of the week, including 6 dollar pitchers a la the Penguin circa 2001.

The back yard has a mysteriously tropical-looking tree and fire pits. And benches. It is comfy and hidden from the street, walled with bamboo, like a grown up's secret tiki-fort.

People here are friendly and there are events, trivia, shows, DJs most nights of the week. But if Drageoke isn't your jam, there's sure to be space in some well-appointed nook to escape the lights and music and sip your beverage while talking or whatever. 

Neeto.. We love this place!! Cool atmosphere and great beers on tap! Come during happy hour for some great appetizers! My favorite is the chicken lettuce  wraps! Also, our waitress Karah was awesome! Super attentive and friendly!!. This place is SO cute. Friendly and very helpful staff. The food was OUTSTANDING. 

Try the bolognese and the tiramisu.. Crazy Shotz was the life of the party! The props are hysterical and made for some ...um ... interesting captures. Great way to practice photo-bombing! Every party should have Crazy Shotz Photo Booth - great fun AND memories!. Arlin is the most awesome trainer I habe ever had. She calls me out and doesn't let me quit. The gym is also amazing. Love it.. I went to Dish nearly three years ago but think of it often, as it certainly is a gem tucked away in an unassuming street corner.  I visit Pittsburgh often but have a terrible sense of the direction in the city, so whenever we're on a street similar to this, my eyes scan the corners for Dish.

The service we experienced was outstanding - friendly staff (without being overly present and overbearing at the table) with great knowledge o the dishes, each dish that we ordered truly lived up to and surpassed expectations.  

Overall, a humble location but right-sized space - there would certainly be lines and special reservations needed for this place if in a bigger city.  Perfect for an intimate dinner for date night or close friends.. This place is close to the strip and has amazing Taiwanese breakfast. 

They serve fresh unsweetened soy milk, and yummy rice ball. One would think deep-fried Chinese donuts would be good, right? But nope, they may be fried in old oil. Here, they have fresh oil! The deep-fried donuts are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Next time I am in Vegas, I will most def swing by for breakfast. 

Plus, for 2 people, my bill came out to be less than $12.. We had 3 glasses of wine and 3 appetizers for only $42. And everything was outta this world great. Service was great. This place is really happening right after work. We were very happy during happy hour.. Excellent brunch spot. I come here often and the food is always fantastic. Enjoying one of my favorite things here today....Prime rib!!. What an unexpected great experience!!

The Yelp app update came in handy Sunday morning when I was too lazy to think of what I wanted for breakfast. On the Search button it listed The Diner under What's for Breakfast? At first, I was like - "what the heck is the LVM resort?" As a Jersey girl who LOVES her diners, I was excited to give this place a try. It was just down the street, and when I looked at the map - I thought it was in a residential subdivision. You could only imagine my surprise when we pulled into this Spanish Trails-esque  entrance and found this adorable diner right where Yelp said it was. I have never heard of a motorcoach resort and apparently I've been living a mile from one for years. The Diner is tucked away on your immediate left as you turn into the LVM.

The service was AWESOME. I mean I've said awesome before and meant it but the service here was truly and absolutely MOST awesome.  Our waitress and the owner took great care of us. There is a fine line between great service and obtrusive service and here was nowhere near that line. I felt like I was at a nice person's house and they were excited to have me over. It was perfect. BIG plus - we ordered coffee and they let us know they had almost every flavor of creamer we could imagine. And they give you the bottle for your table. This amazed my husband. He took a picture of it and everything.

The food was great diner food. If you love "true" diners, then this place is a must-eat. If you've never been to a true diner or you aren't sure - it's a must eat for you too. We both ordered the same thing at the waitress' suggestion : chicken fried steak. It was plenty of food for the price and everything was cooked perfectly. The CFS was crispy & crunchy, the gravy tasted lovely - my husband scarfed it down and I could barely finish my plate.  

The 50s diner & décor is just homey to me. The white walls, red vinyl booths, old school coca-cola napkin dispenser, the old posters on the walls - it brought back a lot of memories of diner-hopping when I was a kid.

This is our new favorite spot. We can't wait to go back and have breakfast again, but I think we'll head over for lunch sometime very soon (they aren't open for dinner). The waitress let us know that their burgers are fresh not frozen and they strive for fresh-quality as much as they can.

Go ahead, hit the bookmark button and plan a trip here for breakfast, brunch or lunch. You will not be disappointed!. I loved stopping in to Lola Tapas for coffee in the morning, and since they've moved over to Central - closer to me - yay - it's even better.  I've always liked Lola Coffee in one sense better than Lux because it's a calmer, quieter atmosphere.   I guess this might reveal the fuddy-duddy in me, but when I'm enjoying my coffee beverage of the day, I'm usually doing something else like checking stuff on the 'puter with the free Wi-Fi, or reading the paper or a book or somethin' like that... and the blaring tunes that are usually playing at Lux can be a bit disconcerting and headache producing.   This is not to dis Lux at all, just that, on that particular point, Lola wins in my book.   The coffee drinks are fabulous, atmosphere and art on the walls very soothing and comfortable.   This location on Central is definitely the hip spot of the future with so many other businesses suddenly moving in there.   I'm curious about this new Hawaiian Tiki restaurant that is coming soon, and soooo happy they decided to preserve the architectural oddity of the building... I'll be watching their progress from my perch at Lola's Coffee.  Go, you'll dig it.. saw thrice perform their farewell tour here.

really awesome concert venue. spacious. not overcrowded and stage is situated that everyone is able to see everything!

hope to attend more concerts here in the future.. For airport food, this was pretty decent. Ordered fish tacos and they brought me shrimp. Waitress felt bad and brought me two extra fish tacos, so I could taste them. AND AND they are hardly selfish with the avocado! I got over a 4th of an avocado on each taco. Do the math! 

The waitress was helpful and extremely friendly. 
 
And don't get me started on the margarita! Don Julio Cadillac Margarita, and MAN! It was RIGHT! She was not selfish with the tequila and I sure appreciated that! 

I will DEFINITELY try again.. I've ordered Vit's a few times now and I really like it! The same guy has delivered my pizza each time I've ordered and he's really sweet. The delivery never takes a long time, I get what I ask for (nothing missing) and everything tastes good. :) 
 I've only had the pizza and mozzarella sticks but I definitely recommend them. The crust isn't too thin but I don't think it's thick at all but my favorite part is the cheese! I don't think Vits is similar to Dominos or Pizza Hut and to me, that's a good thing. Vits is a little pricey but it's worth it, and it's not like expensive or anything. 

Long story short: Vits is my favorite pizza place I've found in Vegas. Don't go by the bad reviews and try it for yourself. :). I am a fan of Thai House, and love it is so close to my home.  The food here is quality thai food, and really full of flavor.  My favorite entree is the yellow curry dish with chicken, and a second runner up is the mussman curry with chicken.  The service is quick, and the staff is very friendly.  The place is pretty small, and since so close to our home, we order for pick-up.. A solid fried chicken establishment.  Despite the long lines, service moves fast.  A good value with local flavor.  I ordered the meal with chicken, hush puppies, coleslaw and tater tots.  The chicken is very crispy and well-seasoned.  Personally, I like a little heat and spice, but this was very good (and greasy).

The sweet tea is WAY too sweet for me, but then again, I'm from the west coast, so sweet tea is a foreign concept for me to begin with.. If you truly care about your taste buds, you will not think twice about ordering the Mediterranean Chicken Salad.  The medley of flavors and textures is awesome!  I'm vegetarian so I order it with tofu instead of chicken and it rocks my world!. We had a bachelorette party there on 11/13/14 with a party of 13. Living out of town wasn't sure how the restaurant would be. 
  Needless to say we had excellent service, food and of course the drinks! They even gave each of us a free margarita and shots of tequila to the Bride to Be. We were also driven back to our hotels in their large van. Amazing night!!! We will definitely be back!!! Thank you so much.. Michelle is great!! This was the second time I used her to get on guest lists for the clubs in Vegas and I could not be happier.  She was so easy to work with, just a few simple texts and we were all set up.  She was friendly and very clear with instructions as far as where to go for lines etc.

A friend of mine referred me to a different promotions group and they were trying to charge DOUBLE the cover of what the club was charging.  DO NOT USE THESE GUYS! STICK WITH MICHELLE! We got in for free at XS and Hakkasan (she put us in contact with a guy to set that up) and even got 2 free drinks at XS. She is absolutely wonderful and I am so glad I stuck to my guns and didn't pay some outrageous fee that the other companies charge.

I will be passing along her information to all of my friends that are going to Vegas and I will 100% be using her when I return.. Mmm, love me some prime rib. I was ecstatic when a friend suggested this place. Though it was off the strip and pricey, I was excited to try some of the world's famous prime rib ever. They also have a location in LA where I'm from but I've never had a chance to make it there. Anyways we arrived on time for our reservation but still had to wait like 20 minutes to be seated. Then when we arrived in the dining room, the place didn't look that full at all. What's up with that? Shouldn't they have prepared our table ahead of time? Anyways as far as prime rib, they have only 4 or 5 choices. And I already looked on the online menu and I know I wanted the Lawry's cut which is their most popular. It's 16 oz, I believe, and only like $4 more than the smaller 10 oz cut. Even if I didn't like prime rib or wasn't that hungry, the Asian in me would be like get the bigger cut because it's only $4 more and you get more bang for your buck. And each of the prime ribs entrees came with the spinning salad, mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding. Everything is served tableside. The spinning salad performance is cool. And I liked the dressing on the salad - it was a little bit tangy. But the salad itself is a bit overdressed - all the leaves were drenched in the dressing. Finally came the main event - the prime rib. The carver came over to our table to cut our meat right there. Oh and waitress serves all the ladies at the table first so guys don't get offended if they pass/ignore you at first.

I got my Lawry's cut medium rare and it was perfect. So pink with the tiniest bit of red/blood and with the bone still connected to it. When I bit into it - heaven, so tender it just melts in your mouth. The put the mashed potatoes on the plate and will ask you if you want any additional sides. Sneaky because on the menu, it says they are extra but they don't mention it when offering it to you so you may get tricked like the person next to me did. She ended up getting the creamed spinach, which was an extra $6. Then after everyone is served, our waitress cut up pieces of the Yorkshire pudding to put on our plates. For anyone who's never had the pudding, it's really like a piece of a roll. Not sure how else to describe it. I was kinda dumb in that I tried to eat the meat off the bone first in an attempt to save the more delicious part for last. But I was so full by the end of the meal that it hurt to try to finish the last few pieces. I ended up leaving a small piece on my plate at the end of the meal and I despise wasting food. But I really couldn't eat anymore. I wish I had enjoyed the piece of meat rather than what was on the bone. Oh well, I know for next time. Our waitress was cool, so happy, cheerful, polite and attentive. We also ended our meal with two birthday desserts. The brought out two mini strawberry shortcakes with candles. I love dessert and strawberries but only had like 2 bites. We all shared but I think we were so stuffed, that all 11 of us couldn't even finish two small desserts. So sad. Overall, it's a really nice place to celebrate special occasions, every once in awhile.. Decided to try this place for breakfast and we are very pleased. It's a Vegas style hole in the wall...hidden gem. They have a $4 breakfast special that rocks! Service was excellent, our waiter was very attentive. I will come here again and possibly try lunch!. It's not everyday you get the chance to take a step into different parts of Africa and try this vast continent's food.  However, this past Saturday, we headed to Merkato for some eastern African fare - specifically, Ethiopian.

Located in the corner of a quiet strip mall, the dark windows can be deceiving.  Walking in, you'll notice a bar to the left and tables in the middle with a stage area in the back.  Guests of all ethnic backgrounds are dining (some Ethiopians, and by the end of the night, more non-Ethiopians).  We chose a table right in the middle.

Our waitress brought our menus over and took our beverage orders.  (Unfortunately, no special Ethiopian drinks were available.)  Not realizing this was the Husband's first time, I immediately took ranks on what to order.

* Yemisir Sambusa "Flakey vegetarian pastries stuffed with spiced lentils" ($1.50) - We ordered one of these, but I guess they forgot to put the order in for it.  It was just as well because we were so full with our main course that we were glad they forgot.  The waitress did apologize when I brought it to her attention.

* Vegetarian Combo "Great variety of vegetarian dishes." ($8.50) - This dish arrived laid out on a piece of injera, which is a large sourdough flatbread and has a bit of a spongy in texture.  It included Injera Salad, side salad, ground bean powder, yellow beans, green lentils, spinach, red lentils, and steamed cabbage and carrots.  Our favorites were the two variations of lentils, the spinach, and the yellow beans.  The bean powder one had a weird texture, similar to baby food.  Overall, everything was really good from the Vegetarian Combo and perfect enough for two to share.

* Kitfo "Ethiopian version of steak tartar, lean red chopped beef minced, blended and delicately seasoned in hot spice 'mitmita'." ($8) - After seeing Andrew Zimmerman's Bizarre Foods, we recalled him eating this raw beef and was definitely game to try.  We were so glad we did.  The waitress brought it to the table and placed it in the middle of the injera that was already laid out with veggies.  It had delicate hints of spice from the chili powder, and had a nice taste and texture.  It didn't seem overly meaty despite it being rare beef.  It had quite simple flavors actually.  It was a nice addition to our Vegetarian Combo and perfect enough to share.

A basket of injera bread also comes along to help you eat since there are no utensils for this part of the dining.  (You just use the bread to pick up whatever you want and pop it into your mouth.)

The waitresses were really friendly, although it does seem like they have sections. (Our waitress stepped out for a bit and I think we were forgotten.)  But it also seems like people really take their time here, so there's no rush for you to eat and leave. 

The Husband felt he had a really good first experience with Ethiopian food, which is definitely a plus.  I personally felt the aftermath of the hot chili powder in the next day, if you know what I mean.  

We'd definitely go back again for more kitfo and to check out their other dishes too.  And it's a bargain to eat here!

We were interested in the Special Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony, but it cost $15.  So we figure we'd save it for another day.

No AMEX accepted.. Amazingly awesome service, food quality, food quantity, and prices!  The hash was fantastic and fresh made.  The pumpkin flapjacks was not to sweet but just right.  It didn't even need the butter or syrup.  And the sage chicken benedict was off the charts!  The chipotle sauce had a nice heat to it.  Just perfect with the mashed potatoes, chicken, spinach, tomato, biscuit, and egg.  Excellent!. Loved it my first time there I went with a friend I got the steak and lobster, he got the halibut, crab cakes as appetizer plus creme brulet ss desert two soft drinks total bill was 88 but considering what we ate very reasonable. Everything was great and great service. The only con was the loud people at the bar.  I would definitely eat there again.. Great food! My honey and I are vegan so we order veggie filled dishes. For first timers, the panang is a MUST! Their sweet potato appetizer is delicious. All the desserts are yummy! We eat here from time to time and we love the panang so much that we hardly ever venture out to other dishes. Also, Dutch is AWESOME!!!. Giving this place 5 stars for the awesome view and kick ass happy hour. I've never had dinner there but based on the appetizers it will not disappoint!. I have loved this place since the day it opened and still do to this very day. To start the place is country adorable!!!! (I know, but I'm a girl, we like these things). The food is creative and delicious! I will always recommend the grilled cheese... It has BACON on it!!! You can't go wrong with bacon! The staff is super nice and the service is quick. Being from Buckeye, you don't get a lot of good options on this side of town but this place is as good as any "Scottsdale" breakfast joint I have ever eaten at. Do yourself a favor and GO!. It's a lovely place to celebrate the mantra of a wonderful wee doggy!

It's very traditional, would appeal to tourists and is rather quaint!

Rather expensive too!. Hands down the best lunch/breakfast I have ever had.  A must try.  Check out Roots at 3rd and Tryon for lunch Tues-Thurs, or Atherton Mill Market on Saturdays for breakfast.  If you live in Dilworth this will be your go-to breakfast place every Saturday!. MEMORABLE.

We are very particular in our restaurant reviews, because we will spend $150-200 for a dinner for two and we expect a lot in return. This place does not disappoint.
Started with cocktails as we waited for our table. We made a reservation, which is recommended if you want a table outside. I had a sazerac, husband had grey goose and tonic. Both made nice and strong.  Priced accordingly. I hadn't had sazerac since probably 1985 at a jazz bar in Dallas. Back then it was served in a sazerac glass straight up. Here at the House it was on the rocks. Supposedly made with absinthe, but it must have been the legal kind here sold stateside. Good drink. Strong and like a Manhattan, but better. Interesting.

Started dinner with the cheese platter. They were out of the truffle cheese, but we went with four others. It was served with dried cranberries, dried cherries, a fig jam which was divine, grilled toast and also some smoked almonds. The platter was a lot for two people, but it was our own fault for picking 4 cheeses.

Next was the salad.. husband had house greens and I had the deconstructed Brussels sprouts and spinach salad with goat cheese, walnuts and blood orange. It was amazing.

Had the Riesling and the Pinot Noir. Both excellent.

The entrees were the stars, however. I had pasta pillows with pork belly with a Meyer lemon zest sauce with fresh peppers, and my husband had the lemon chicken...wow! seasoned to perfection and the skin grilled perfectly, served alongside whole red potatoes that were mashed down in the skin. This was, by far, one of the best meals I have ever tasted anywhere in the country.

Finished with Stella Blue coffee, black. Perfect end. Brought home two desserts for the teenagers (and for us to bite into--who were we kidding?!) The custard with salted caramel and cookies and the canollis filled with chocolate ganache.

The chef here is Manhattan trained and it is evident. Can't say any more about how worth it it is to try this place at least once. Foodies will not be disappointed.

This is a very unique dining experience. The house is an old Spanish mansion. The courtyard is lovely, lit up with twinkling romantic lights, and the trees were sultry in bloom. Ah, what a fragrance! A must for lunch OR dinner.. I have a problem.  I'm addicted to foot massages, or rather, what comes along with the foot massages.  (Thank goodness the Big F has the same problem.)  The growing trend in Southern California and Vegas are these foot massage places that leave you feeling oh-so good without taking your clothes off.

For $28, you get 45 minutes of your body getting worked on.  On this occasion, Tan had my feet sitting in a hot water bath as he worked on my shoulders, head, and neck.  At this point, I really could care less if he got to my feet.  But after spending a few minutes on my arms, he reclines my chair back as he gets working on my feet.  In our semi-private room, the Big F is seated next to me in his own reclining chair having May work on his tired feet as well.  He later comments that she did such a great job digging into his feet, he really enjoyed her handiwork.

Other prices include:
$38 for 60 minutes
$48 for 75 minutes
$55 for 90 minutes

They do take credit cards, but I think their credit card machine was acting up when we went. So bring cash just in case.  At the end of your session, they ask you to fill out a little survey rating how they did, which I think is a great idea.  Hey, everyone needs a little feedback, right?  Anyway, looks like this one could be one of our favorites in Vegas!. I have been coming to this bar for awhile now and I have always loved it. The bartenders are really cool, well the ones that work late at night are and the food is really good for bar food. It is also right across from where I live so once again convenience is key. Me and my boyfriend both get off pretty late at night and by the time we can go eat its usually just bar food options and this one is definitely a winner. I always get the turkey melt and tater tots (yummy :p) but my boyfriend usually gets something different and I always try what he gets and have yet to be disappointed.  The machines hit a decent amount as well. I have personally hit a bunch of five spots (I'm a keno lover) and my boyfriend has hit just as many if not more. Soooooooo if you want good food, good machines, a decent beer selection on tap, and yummy bar good hit up this bar! I haven't been to many others ones but of the other ones I have been to I kinda gotta admit I like this one the best.. I recently had many pieces of old jewelry melted down and reset into a necklace and a ring. The Jewelers were awesome to work with. I live in California and they were very accommodating with sending me photos and the waxes to ensure I liked the setting prior to it being cast. They were WAY more affordable than any place I spoke with in California and worked quickly on my pieces. Additionally, they bought back my left over materials (gold, diamonds, etc.) that I didn't need in the new setting. I have found myself a new jeweler and it makes no difference to me that they are in a different state. Thank you, Joanie for being so wonderful!. I can't believe I haven't reviewed Jade Palace before!  My husband and I go there often and love it.  We've been living in the area for 5 years and Jade Palace was one of the first restaurants we found that we both really liked.  The inside of the restaurant is very nice, and we've always had really great service.  The food is top notch!  We've never had a bad meal there.

My husband's absolutely favorite is the hot and sour soup, he is a total hot and sour soup snob and he loves this one.  I often stop there just to pick up a big container of it for him.  The crab rangoons are really good too, not greasy and lots of filling.  The General Tao's chicken is one of our favorites but the sauce is a little different than most Chinese restaurants.  I absolutely adore the mu shu chicken and anything in kung pao sauce is divine.   The fried rice is really delicious too; we always order it with beef.  My new favorite is the chow fun noodles house special (pork, chicken and shrimp.)  If you like lo mein try the chow fun for something different.  Its flat rice noodles.

The lunch specials are really awesome too.  I think they range from about $7-$11, you get your choice of egg drop soup or hot and sour, a main entree, fried rice, a spring roll, and a crab rangoon.  

We get a lot of takeout from Jade Palace and the takeout orders are huge.  They also deliver.

Just a warning, anything marked spicy will NOT be spicy.  If you want it spicy ask them to make it extra hot.. What a great experience!  We had two teams from work that were competing against one another.... boys against the girls.  I told the boys they were in trouble!  We escaped!!! I had never done this before and I was afraid it might seem a little claustrophobic, but not at all.  I highly recommend Escape the Room AZ for a work event or just a group of friends.  Great fun.  Thank you!. Awesome staff. Our server, Nicole, was such a dear. Despite her being so busy, she would always drop by our table every now and then to ask us how we were, occasionally staying to chit-chat for a bit. 

My family was seated at a comfy booth overlooking the stage. This was at about 9:30pm. The lights were dimmed and when we noticed that the spotlight was aimed at the stage, we knew there was going to be a live band and couldn't contain ourselves. Before delving into the restaurant's ambiance, I'm pretty sure my parents would agree with me that the food was pretty savory - although nothing out of the ordinary to be honest. We had a triple decker sandwich that came with fries, crab and corn chowder as well as buffalo wings. Except for the soup, definitely try out the other 2 orders. 

Music started at 10pm sharp and went on for an hour. I was very impressed with the band's line-up and still couldn't quite get over the fact that they sang one of the hardest and my most favourite songs - More than a feeling by Boston. Sure, it was pretty loud but what would you expect at a Vegas restaurant? We didn't really get a chance to talk while the band played which helped us channel our focus solely on the food. I guess that's a good thing. Overall, I would recommend people to try out the place. Just take note of this; if you like a more mellow ambiance, try getting to the restaurant earlier in the day.. I couldn't be happier with the service the birddoggers did on my leaking house!  Woke up this morning and my shower would NOT turn off.  I called and they were able to come to my house and fix it in under and hour, in what world does that usually happen and on a Saturday no less?   Their price was fair and reasonable, I would highly recommend them and will call them in the future if I have another plumbing crisis!. This place was AWESOME. Greatest service and food. I see people talking about service being a problem, but this certainly wasn't the case with our trip there. Had the fried chicken- the yams and the Mac and cheese were TO DIE FOR. And the waitress we had was absolutely amazing and went out of her way to get us tourist suggestions. Best place to eat.. I stumbled upon this place on Instagram and am so glad I did! The food was amazing. Genius idea.. Good food. Decent portions.  Somewhat slow for not being that busy.  I love the huge soda cups so we don't have to get a refill every five minutes.  Had great special happy hour prices.. I love this place! A group of us went to Vegas this weekend and were looking for good quality food, reasonable pricing and good drinks!! we walked through the whole strip and my boyfriend found them on yelp and we thought we'd give it a shot. This places menu is mind blowing! (similar to 50/50 slaters in pasadena, CA.) I used to live in vegas and this spot was never there.. so thankful to discover this treasure. from now on, on all my Vegas trips I will be coming here. Their also open 24hrs!! prices are very cheap and very large portions. I ordered the sausage w/ gravy biscuits, mashed potato and fruit plate mmmm... so good! everything everybody else ordered I tasted and was excellent as well. Presentation is a 10!!! both thumbs up!. I'm picky about Mexican food.

I enjoyed the food here.  A lot.
So much so, that I would like to come back, daily.
But I'm not rich, so I won't

However!
Here is what I loved when I ate here:

1.  Rocky Point Pizza- cheese and shrimp and mango sauce... SO GOOD!!!
2.  Spicy jalapeno sausage slider things.  Really spicy.  For realz.  But they have this delicious spicy mayo on them... OMG.  To die for.
3.  Mini chimis.  Succulent meat and cheese wrapped in a cute pocket and deep fried.  Need I say anything else.

So yes.  I'm a big fan.. John and Dalisa are talented creatives who continuously evolve to stay passionate and provide the best photography art available!  They are not only talented but deeply care about their clients and intuitive about their needs. 
I received great artistic shots for my modeling portfolio as well as sweet, beautifully captured images of my precious newborn baby.  Your wedding, your maternity shoot, the first week of your baby's life, can only be captured once. Altf is the right choice.. Whenever you are feeling like dessert definitely hit this place!it will blow any negative feelings away!cookies are freshly baked and ice cream is so creamy!there are so many flavors that some times it's really hard to make a decision!!my recommendation is to get a cookie sandwich with at least one of the cookies being the brownie cookie...so good!!!. Oh Grimaldis, where do I start?!? The pizza is amazing (pepperoni and jalapeño being our family favorite) and its always made perfectly with the right amount of toppings but the reason I can't give 5 stars is because I can't understand why the bathrooms are so small!!! Three people can not even fit in their comfortably, I like to wash my hands without reaching over people so that's why I have to give 4 stars. If the bathroom was spacious it would definitely be 5 stars!!! But service and pizza are amazing!. The Market LV is a creative addition to Tivoli. The space consists of little specialty shops and a wine bar. Some of the stores in here are B Sweet (candy shop), Cupkates (cupcakes), Thimbleberry House (florist), River North (home decor), Mugsy & Moxie's Bully Couture (pet store). It's cool to walk a short distance and experience so many different shops.. I usually order sushi for take out, here. It's made fresh, well-made, and reasonably priced. However, the large menu selection always intrigued me. They have things from noodle bowls, to hot pot, to hibachi, to sushi, to curry -- and other Chinese dishes. 

Today I had the fried Gyoza staters and as an entré, the yellow curry chicken (which was denoted as being spicy). The curry was creamy and tasted just right, although, I expected a little more spiciness. It has a good amount of potatoes and sautéed onions, but not too much, and a generous amount of chicken, all in a very large portion (too much for me to eat all of it).

I went with my mother, who ordered sesame chicken. She gave me a taste. While it was sweet and a little crunchy, they really skimped out on the sesame seeds. It was otherwise pretty tasty.

The atmosphere is not understated (good) and comfortable. You have booths and tables at which to sit, and a few are set up to seat larger parties. There's an all-you-can-eat sushi buffet at the entrance, where the sushi chef does his/her art. 

Overall, I was quite satisfied with this cozy, little restaurant. I definitely will recommend it to someone looking for Chinese food, or something asian. I hear the hot pot is great, and (at about $20/person) one day, I do look forward to trying that.. I always stated that CHRIS HORNAK is the man!!
Because through him, I've been in several nightclubs and, which is best: no hassles or waiting on line for soo long... I've been in Pure, XS, Blush, LAX and JET... The only thing that you have to do is go straight to his website and fill a very simple form (dates, Male/Female, phone #) and you'll ready to go: the only thing that you have to do on the first night is to visit any club from Palms, such as Moon, Rain, Playboy or Ghostbar...
So, I will going to doing the same again, because I always have a great time.... I LOVED THIS SHOW!!

The show was an amazing tribute to Michael and his genius ability to create music. 
To me the show was so much more than just the acts: the overall message was powerful and I think the people who will sit and criticize the show didn't get it. MJ's music was and will live forever. I loved how the acts complimented the message of his songs.

The overall acts were also amazing. The pole dancer: breathtaking! The glowing dancers: fantastic! The one-legged break dancer: inspirational!

The main character who played Michael was, hands down, the best dancer I have ever seen in my life. He literally glided across the stage and was amazingly talented!

One of the things that impressed me the most was how effortless the acts were. Most people can't even do a pull up! The performers all made everything look so easy.  

If you're looking for a show that just features just acrobats and acrobats only, no, this isn't the show for you. 

But if you're a fan of Michael Jackson's music and want to see some amazing talent, I would HIGHLY recommend this show!

I wish it could've gone on forever!!. First, I don't understand the negative reviews. It appears some people are too picky to eat out and maybe should stay home. The prices of the food are reasonable considering they make everything from scratch, including the beer, pizza dough, etcetera. Which makes the food delicious by the way. 

I had the brussel sprout and pork belly pizza. It was delicious. The brussel sprouts weren't overcooked so were good. The pork belly was crispy and the crust was crisp and not soggy. The menu is not too big. My advice is to choose items where you actually like the ingredients. Then you may be happy. 

The service was friendly and fast, Brandon the bartender took care of us well. We went slightly past lunch time but they were decently busy. They are still looking for more good servers, so if you are looking for a cool place to work check it out. We met the owner who is pretty neat, she is a surgical nurse in addition to opening a new restaurant. 

The owner Rebecca also rescues exotic birds, including abused and disabled birds which are housed at the restaurant. The birds are not in the way of seating or food but by the entrance. They are nice and funny, the parrots talk and dance. The bar is open to the extensive patio seating area, which is lovely and well shaded. 

All in all, a place I will be going to again.. Boyfriend had the sage chicken and I had an Indiana special ( crispy potatoes, eggs, biscuits and gravy ) and we both loved our meals. The portions on our meals were huge, so we didn't leave hungry. We should have known it was going to be big when the sage chicken was a Man Vs. Food Favorite :) Service was great and we'll be back here.. This place has the best burgers and sushi I've ever tasted!!!!! And the staff is VERY friendly! Especially our server James& the other girl whose name I forgot to spell but starts with a L. They're awesome.. My favorite sandwich shop in Las Vegas! The Bobbi is amazing. They use real turkey not lunch meat. Bread is super fresh and they have wise potato chips. (My husband favorite chip and he has not had the since he moved from PA 15 years ago) everyone should try this place at least once and you will be hooked.. Most people will have you believe that the only smoked meat worth having in Montreal is from Schwartz's Deli, however in my neighborhood most people will gladly tell you that Le Roi Du Smoked Meat is as good if not better than Schwartz's. There is no line out the door, the service staff is not hurried and pressured because of a hungry mob outside smacking their chops and elbowing their way in and best of all the food is excellent. Although I always take our order to go, I rather like the classic 50's diner setting of the restaurant. I took my mother here and she offered to babysit two nights later solely in exchange for another Le Roi Du Smoked Meat sandwich. As she put it, she couldn't stop thinking about her first fabulous Le Roi Du Smoked Meat sandwich.. Tiny hole in the wall in the middle ... literally nowhere! It's a good thing I live close to nowhere because The Pork Shop rocks! 

Their BBQ pulled pork and BBQ pulled pork burritos are awesome. My 5 year-old's remark when he first ate it was "it's better than a cupcake!". LOL. 

I'm not a big fan of summer sausages, but their jalapeno and cream cheese summer sausage is outstanding. My neighbor likes their pepper sticks, but I can pass on them. 

Get ready to stand in line if you're there on a Saturday. It gets busy even early in the morning.. I am definitely a fan of their tuna ahi sandwich and their fontina burger, along with their fried zucchini and garlic fries! Be sure to get there early during the weekends or after the afternoon rush!! Not going to lie I love the farm grill more than Joe's BBQ! Friendly staff, great surrounding neighborhood and atmosphere!. My 4 stars for Hanny's are driven almost completely by the atmosphere of this converted department store. A friend and I met up for drinks there last Friday, and lingered for around 5 hours (another friend was flying in from NYC and his flight was delayed several times, so the rounds kept coming). 

Several people have commented negatively on the service, lighting or music, but they must be working out the kinks with all of the above because they were spot-on during our visit. The DJ was spinning a combination of subtle vibe-enducing music mixed with "oh, I LOVE this song" uncovered and unexpected old favorites. The lighting gradually shifting during the evening, so that by midnight it was a cozy and romantic mood. 

Speaking of, let me just say it: something about this place just felt...sexy. I don't know if it was the music, the lighting, the "baby it's cold outside" week before Christmas, or my malbec-shiraz. The things-could-happen-here feel especially hit me when I went upstairs and saw the unisex restrooms all lined up; white unmarked doors all in a row to their own little rooms -- it was straight out of a Madonna video circa 1995! 

Biggest watchout: the martini glasses were offensively and ridiculously tiny. I mean, really?!? I had read about this in reviews before going, but I was so shocked at the size that I refused to order one and stuck with wine (which I wouldn't say was a "healthy" pour, but at least took me more than 4 sips to finish). The menu is also relatively limited. We shared the bar plate and a prosciutto pizza (added mushrooms) and enjoyed both, but neither were outstanding or very filling. 

All-in-all, I will definitely recommend this place to friends for drinks or drinks/apps. It's a unique space with a great vibe and I am sure it will do well once word gets out.. Nikki is amazing! Such a sweetheart and her tanning skills are amazing.  She made my skin look bronze and beautiful! Seriously go to her and she won't disappoint. I've been going to Camille for my color & cut since she was at another salon.  I would follow her anywhere!  My previous stylist didn't really listen and my red hair was always muddy looking and cut in almost a mullet.  Camille listened to me and gave me a look that I love.  Red hair is notoriously hard to keep but she finds a way to keep it vibrant and beautiful.  I recommend Camille to everyone and now she does my mom and niece too.. We came for FirstFridays and had a blast. Everything was free except food but they gave us a coupon. The volunteers were friendly and knowledgable. Little gem for the downtown lunch crowd!  I was a devoted Resnicks fan, but they've been  replaced as my fave salad/wrap/sandwich place.  This place is amazeballs!  Salads are HUGE and made fresh.  Sure you have to wait a while for your salad to be made but that's because they make it fresh...cutting the turkey, chicken, etc...as they go. My coworkers have enjoyed the roast beef sandwich (extra horseradish please), turkey sandwich, turkey wrap and the california club and ALL have raved about how delicious and filling they are!  The owner is a sweetheart and is very thankful for your business.  It feels great to support local businesses so do your neighbors a favor and come to SIMPO...PRONTO!!  

P.S. they deliver!!   And if your hands are full, they have someone on hand to walk you out and assist you.  This place is LEGIT.. Met up with some friends here for dinner one evening. None of us had been there so it was a new experience for us all. We had a table inside, right outside the patio which is very cute. Two of us arrived before HH ended, so I got a margarita (horchata & fireball). Too much fireball for my taste but others may like it. I also ordered a taco to try but didn't get it and didn't want to make a fuss. We shared the spicy salsa flight. I really only enjoyed the ghost pepper salsa and their house salsa. For my entree I had the filadelphia in burrito form which was huge, filling, and very good. I took half home to eat the next day. We ended the meal by sharing the churro dessert which was good. All in all, I'd be back and recommend it to others.. Dr. Sudha has been my toddler's doc since birth and I can't say enough about Dr. Sudha and her staff. Everyone is great and they remember all the children by first name that come in! 

Not only that, Dr. Sudha understands the human aspect of patient care because she's so affectionate with her patients, something that I truly love and appreciate!

In addition, most pediatric offices are decorated with child characters or animals, but Dr. Sudha's nicely decorated office has pictures of real children with disabilities on her wall. What a great way to display the diverse world of children that surround us! 

I highly recommend her practice to new or existing parents looking for a pediatric office!. These cupcakes are really cute and definitely tasty. Not the best I have had still, this place is worth a visit. There are so many flavors to choose from. The red velvet, the champagne, and the carrot cake are a few of my favorites. The cake is always moist and the icing is always delicious. However, these cupcakes are a little pricey at about $4.00 a cupcake.. I went here today for the first time and your pizza is very good! I love the build your one pizza aspect, and the prices are decent priced as well. My husband and I will definitely be coming back here!. Service was outstanding.  I ordered pasta arrabiata and it was quite good.  The coffee is very good here too along with the pizza crust.. No trip to Phoenix is complete for me unless I have Spinato's Pizza.  This is the first time I have been to this new location and it is just as good as the others with a really nice decor and great service.  We always get the Sausage and Pepperoni pizza, and it's always good.  Also, we always start with the garlic cheese bread, seriously the best I have had anywhere!  The sauce on their pizza is different, a little sweet, but I love it.  If you are looking for good pizza in Phoenix, this would be not only my top, but my only recommendation!. Food is awesome, Love the Sparkiling Pomegranite!! Will be back just for that. Also the manager stooped by our table and said hello, Nice touch Danielle. Thank You for the outstanding experience. We Will be Back. We came here for the first time the other night and the atmosphere blows you away! The interior has an industrial feel to it with exposed pipes in the ceiling (so cool!) and awesome seating. There are a few options: long tables with bench seating (great for large groups), high tops with cool chairs, bar seating (same chairs), and booths that look REALLY comfortable. I can't imagine anyone not liking this space. Moving on to the drinks... wow what a selection! We love locally brewed beer and they have so much of it! They also support craft beers from all over the nation (we generally stay away from domestics and prefer trying new beer when we go out). The server was very knowledgeable about the beer and helped me pick one out that I would like based on my known preferences. I had a hef, can't remember the name, but it was crisp and refreshing. The food was also really good. We went during happy hour which includes $2 off appetizers. We shared the pretzel and cheese fondue (really tasty! the pretzel bread was warm and delicious, so fresh! and the cheese was sharper than what you usually get, something we really enjoyed), the mussels and clams with a butter sauce- this was really good too, although we thought the sauce could use more lemon, maybe more garlic, and if they charred the bread a bit it would add more flavor- but we still liked it and ate it all! We also had the mignonettes (tiny filet mignons on crostini with blue cheese, pesto and a creamy horseradish sauce/dressing) SO AMAZING! By far my favorite of the food we tried! The manager stopped by to see how we were enjoying, always something I appreciate about an establishment. Of course we had no complaints, this place is GREAT!. I had never cut my hair before and was super nervous!  My appt was with Shannon- she was friendly and chatted just enough to make me feel relaxed.  She did a great job listening to me and cutting my hair better than I imagined!!!  My daughter went also her appt was with Stephanie.  She got a color and cut, Stephanie did an awesome job and gave us tips on how to style her hair in the future.   Everyone there was friendly and it was a clean professional shop.  Will go there again for sure!!!!!. We ate here today for the first time and quite liked it!  We got to Snooze rather late and yes there was a 30 min wait but the great thing is they offer a text alert when your table is ready!  Super great because Town and Country has really transformed with many great shops and additional restaurants and of course the newish Whole Foods, which I could spend all day in frankly.

So we get the text and dart back to see what awaits.  Great service, fun decorum and yummy food.  I had the Lower East Side and it was a nice switch to eat my lox with goat cheese.  Tasty Toast and just the right amount of food, not too little not too much.

My boyfriend had the Chilaquiles Benedict which was really delicious!  I had several bites and will no doubt order it when we go back.  We also had Mimosas that were equally great with fresh squeezed O.J. and not too bad on the price since they were quite big.

I will say that the hash browns that D. had were lacking in seasoning but overall everything tasted fresh and we both will be back!  

PS. If the server we had is ever to read this, I was the customer who left you the horribly low tip on the heals of telling you that I hoped you made good money due to so many people hanging out later than you all serve!  I think that my Mimosa had kicked in and I do math like a special person without the booze!   I am truly sorry, I will make up for it when we return and request you!. This was on our ladies night out list for my bachelorette party last month. We hit a  few spots before nestling at Moon & Ghostbar as they are uber close to each other. 

I recommend. Good vibe, gorgeous crowd, decent bartenders and a view that would make anyone feel like Paris Hilton...

The bouncers could use a lollipop to cheer them up though. They all seemed a little grumpy!. I love this place! Excellent quality work, family  owned, friendly employees. The best pedicures, and gel/shellac that actually stays on! Helen is now doing facials & I can actually say it was the BEST facial I've ever had. I refer people here all of the time!. Best pizza experience ever!!!. Love the new location. It looks even more of east coast diner. Most New York-like deli around. Everything I've had is good. The corned beef sandwich is is so good that the sandwich does not need any cheese or condiments because it is good by itself.

The fries are actually pretty bad and need some seasoning. I also wish the prices were a little more reasonable. Other than that this place is amazing!!!!



Don't forget to check in on Yelp to get a free Mac and cheese!. Came here for a team luncheon. They were great in accommodating 24 people. Brady our server was awesome. Pizza was delicious! Thin crust! Very very tasty! Cesar salad was great! I'm going to make sure I come back before I go back home!. I came to Findlay Honda Henderson going to leave with the car I've wanted for years, a Honda Accord Coupe. Jason took personally evaluated what I wanted in a car and the first car he picked from the lot was the one I left with. Amazing staff and Jason made everything as painless as possible. Needless to say, I'm happy with my purchase and I would refer anyone to them. Thank you for everything!. We have a dog and this hotel was perfect. Everything was simply easy and the staff was friendly but not over bearing. The rooms look like they were recently renovated and the bed was really comfortable. 

A little outside of the city but easy access and close to mount Washington and the incline, which made getting to the city more fun. 

Lots of easy open and free parking and complimentary breakfast made this a really good value.. My husband and I spent the Fourth of July in Phoenix because I had to catch a plane the next morning. We were looking for someplace nice to mark the holiday and also celebrate our honeymoon. (But remember, we're from Tucson, so our definition of "nice" is a little different.)

We'd been to a few of the other Fox restaurants and wanted to try something new. Culinary Dropout was open late, and their menu looked fun.

We certainly got what we bargained for -- classic comfort foods with a twist set in an alternative atmosphere that was really enjoyable. Initially, we were worried the place was over-hyped (lots of tattooed hipsters and a dining room that could have been featured in a Rock 'n Roll issue of Dwell magazine. Luckily the decor was a compliment to the food instead of a distraction.

We got the pretzel bites with provolone fondue for an appetizer, then my husband got the meatloaf and I got the fried chicken for dinner. Ho-le-cow the food was good. I mean totally delicious and better than Mom makes (sorry, Mom).

The service was great and the food was really something to write home about. We'd definitely come here again!. Warm and cozy dinning experience. The food was fantastic. I ordered the chicken parm as I always do anytime I go to any Italian restaurant. Coming from the east coast I am very picky about how they prepare and make it. Uncle sal's did a fantastic job and our waitress was great.. Huge fan, we eat lunch here weekly. Have tried every salad on the menu, all very good. Prices are ok, and service is pretty much always excellent. I did find one little hair in my salad once, just once. have forgiven them, but i never forget, if this happens again then I'll complain.  Also the biggest negative, is that on two different occasions I have witnessed the homeless walk in - holding their own cup from the street and walk straight to the fountain drink & iced teas AND TOTALLY JUST HELP THEMSELVES TO THE REFRESHMENTS AND THEN WALK OUT. Like I said I have seen this twice now and so I don't understand how the employees aren't seeing this and stopping it. I feel bad for the filthy, smelly, homeless crackies that are thirsty.. But seriously I don't know what kind of filth, bugs, fleas, ticks, dandruff, dry ashy skin cells that their shedding and dragging in with them, and the filthy hands and also their drag in their oh not so welcoming aromas!!!!!!!!!!!!! yuk. actually now that i re-read my true words I feel like changing the 4 to a 3 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ugh the truth hurts.  anyways yea this is factual and btw the hubby always only gets the same turkey & brie cheese sandwich - HE GOES NUTS FOR IT - ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Union Grill was the one of the places I somehow never ate at while I was a student, even though a good friend absolutely loved it (well, it and the $10 wine bottle list they offered - I didn't catch if they still offer this or not now, but I hope they do!). Since graduation I'd honestly kind of forgotten about it. So when a group of people and I more or less stumbled in here after another place was too busy and had no room for us, I figured that I needed to do more than just enjoy a single drink while I was here.

So normally I think Union Grill is a no-frills grub and drink sort of place, but when we came in it was pretty cutesy looking since it was decorated for V-Day. Picture hearts and streamers everywhere, and you've got the decor they had going on here. I actually remember thinking to myself that the decorations combined with the dim (but not TOO dim) lighting will make for a decent date spot, at least for students.

Way more memorable and important than the decorations, however, was the service. Once we'd been seated an excellent waiter came right over to warn us that the place would no longer accept orders after 9:00pm, which was when they officially closed. Note that we came in and we were seated around 8:55pm. So we did have to order quickly before the kitchen closed, but at that point we were just happy that they were allowing us in given how late it was; they could have easily told us they were closing and no more people were welcome, and if they had we would have ended up walking back out into the cold looking for another place to grab a drink and a bite to eat.

After quickly skimming the menu three of us ordered grilled cheese sandwiches (Union Grill allows you to add 3 toppings to a grilled cheese sandwich here - I ordered guacamole, mushrooms and bacon) while one person ordered fish or chicken (I honestly forget which). We also all ordered a variety of ciders and beers to go with our meals; I personally ordered the smaller drink size, and the result was that my arsenal cider looked like a baby drink next to the bigger ones. But hey, it was arsenal cider and it was good and that's really all that matters in my book.

As for the food? I have to say, the grilled cheese I was ordered was absolutely delicious - it wasn't overly toasted so it didn't crunch into pieces whenever I took a bite, and there was a great a balance of mushrooms and guacamole to boot. Also, the waffle fries the sandwiches game with? Just wonderful - not too crunchy, well seasoned, and honestly just what I'd expect in a good order of waffle fries. Everyone else looked as satisfied as I was as we chatted, ate and enjoyed our drinks until the place turned on the lights and we knew it was time to head out so they could clean and go home.

After the experience I had here I would totally return to make up for my never eating here as a student. Union Grill may not be the flashiest place in Oakland but the food is still wonderful for what it is, and the great staff that was working here during my visit elevate the place a lot in my mind. Next time I stop in I'll definitely check to see if they still offer their "wine bottle for $10" deal - that would just be the cherry on top of this place if they did!. FAVORITE breakfast spot, the lox and jalapeño bagel is GLORIOUS. Iced Americano with cream is strong but smooth. The staff is always so friendly, and all the food I've seen looks phenomenal. My go to.. I am in love. First of all, I'm a taco connoisseur & a tequila lover, so it wouldn't have taken much to please me. However, the corona & lime chicken tacos were excellent, our server was knowledgeable about tequilas (& able to find something for my hyper-picky best friend to eat), & the margaritas were good enough that my generally thrifty friends ordered 3 each.

I agree that it would be helpful to have some sort of primer on tequila for those who are less tequila-inclined, but I will definitely be back.. This place is awesome!  Originally came here on a Groupon but ended up staying!!  I tend to get easily bored when it comes to working out but at Revolution, they change it up daily!!  I love the attitude of the trainers and other gym - goers at this place, everyone is encouraging & supports you no matter what your personal fitness level is.  This place is worth a try if you want a real workout!. Such a fun place! They draw the picture on the canvas so that everything comes out perfect! It was cool to be able to change the colors and make the painting my own instead of following every step the instructor showed, like at other places. I love this place. It is THE place to go if you love making your own clothes or just love making things. It does take a few visits to truly get a feel for the massive amount of stuff they carry....but the prices are SO GOOD and they have things I haven't ever been able to find at Hobby Lobby, Michael's etc. 

I totally disagree with the comments about bad customer service or crotchety staff....I've always found the ladies there a delight, if they're not too busy just ask their advice or opinions, they have a wealth of knowledge and experience and I've always found them ready to help out a newbie sewer from England who finds it hard transferring from metric to imperial.

It is an Aladdin's Cave....you never know what delights you might find there - though I have learnt to try and make a list before going, otherwise I could be in there all day touching fabrics and notions and dreaming.. Very nice place. It was a great massage, more for tissue/spinal issues than for relaxation. Which is great because I sit all day at work. Definitely try it out!. We order take out from here frequently.  I am obsessed with their food. I order something different almost every time and I love it every time! 

Some highlights?  Kimchi fried rice, Chicken rice noodle soup, pot roast soup

But seriously, anything you order, you can't go wrong.  Now I want to go there again just writing about it.. They patched a hole in my boyfriend's tire for free (he wasn't sure why it was free... he might have bought the tires from Discount Tires, but he couldn't remember...).  We came in only like 30 minutes before they closed, but they still serviced his tire for him.. This resort is definitely worthy of a 5-star review. We stayed at the Westin Kierland for 3 days upon arriving in Arizona (our new home). From being greeted at the front door to the on-site restaurants and beyond, the staff is welcoming, courteous and knowledgable. We traveled cross-country from Boston (by car, with a dog) and they accommodated every need we had. We had a first floor room with patio for quick & easy exits with puppy girl. Dog bowls and bed. Helpful directions and even free shuttle service. 
Amenities and cleanliness were 5-star
Food was good 4.5-star
Location was 5-star
Service was 5-star
I would recommend the Westin Kierland for friends and family - as well as fellow Yelpers!. Was visiting my sister and we stopped here for dinner
The tacos here were really spot on and affordable and the guac was delicious, not as good as LA but for Charlotte it's a pretty darn good spot for tasty and affordable mexican fare. I think these folks did a great job with my car. Upon arriving, the attendant pointed out to me an empty lane I overlooked, which would speed my wait. Thanks! The shop was really clean and all the employees were friendly and helpful. The prices are comparable to Danny's. I wish I knew about the wash discount with a gas purchase because that would have saved me money but that is something I own for not noticing (just a little bummer). What I DID like was Tony, their glass rep, noticed I needed a new windshield, and when I explained to him I had an appointment to get it replaced this weekend, he didn't drop the conversation. Instead, like a good sales rep should, he engaged some more and next thing I know, he's invented me to swap my appointment and get service with them. He made that so easy!. This restaurant was formerly the Dirty Drummer on Shea, at the 51.  The management redesigned the interior, spiffed up the menu and the result is a great bar/diner THAT HAS THE BEST HANGOVER BREAKFAST IN TOWN!!!   All homestyle farm cookin' with a mexican twist--Nana's Hash is awesome. Huevos Rancheros kills it.   The bloody mary's are GREAT.  You'll drink at least 2.   The atmosphere is perfectly subdued, nothing fancy, easy on the brain.  Don't come here for a fine dining experience, but DO come here for awesome food that fills you up.  This town needs more great breakfast options.  PS-LUNCHERS, ONE OF THE BEST QUESADILLAS IN TOWN.. Today, Whole Foods has lost their greatest employee, a woman named Angel who worked at the juice bar. When I first started going to Whole Foods I went to the paradise valley location, near my house. This was four years ago. Angel was always such a delight to talk to. She was always happy to help any customer that walks into her store, whether they be a regular like myself, or someone who had never imagined drinking vegetable juice (like the first time I walked in). She even made me my own personalized smoothie, the Peanut Butter a la Katie. (It had a lot of chocolate and bananas, she knew the way to my heart.) She was funny and helpful, and the type of person who you could just look at and know that she has a very kind soul. When she was transferred to the Tempe location, I started driving half an hour just to get my juice fix from her. It seemed the only logical solution. 

Over the past four years, through the ten minute windows it takes to get a juice, I've watched Angel deal with outrageous requests, crazy pregnant women, rude customers, and creepy men who's favorite past time is to hit on the local juice girl, and I've watched her handle every situation with grace and dignity. People may not realize it, but the juice bar is probably the most stressful position at that store. 

When Angel told me she was leaving Whole Foods I was selfishly upset. But she's moving on with her life from a company that has taken many employees for granted. And for that I am happy. Angel- I wish you the best in your new job, upcoming marriage, and your ambitions of starting a family. Whole Foods- I hope you learn to appreciate your team members, and I hope you took time to cherish this specific one, there isn't another one like her.. Carpe Diem is such an elegant place to dine.  Their modern, yet neutral toned decor appeals to all.  Small details such as ceiling molding that curves and allows light to sift through, just adds another touch of class.  The light fixtures that pop out of the wall like bunches of flowers are gorgeous.  Just my style!  So ambiance gets an A+.  Now on to service...

Service - excellent.  Our waiter was attentive to all of our needs.  There were three of us in attendance.  We each relied on him for wine recommendations and they were superb and reasonably priced.  He was able to share all of the specials without having to recite from any cards.  He responded well to our many questions regarding the menu.  

Food - just perfect.  We ordered calamari and a seared tuna appetizer plate.  They were just out of this world.  The different unique but flavorful dijon based side sauce for the calamari was perfect.  Tuna was amazing.  The garnishes allowed you to make your own little test experiments.  Mmmm!

For dinner I ordered the "Eggplant Roulade."  It was delicious.  It does have a smokey flavor to the sauce which I was initially hesitant about.  After trying it, I did like it.  Overall, I enjoyed my selection.  Next time, I will try the Cous Cous.  The waiter gave it very high marks.

I will definitely be visiting Carpe Diem again!. Recently I went to a yoga class. The class was wonderful! Taught by a Bikram yoga instructor. I absolutely loved it! I can not wait to return for another class. The instructor was professional and knew what she was doing. The room temperature was in accordance with Bikram policies. I also got a massage on a separate occasion, and it was wonderful. Very professional I feel amazing. I will definitely go back! I highly recommend this place. It's clean, beautiful and wonderful classes.. I'm not a big fan of smoked meat, but everyone who has come here with me has LOVED the smoked meat sandwiches. IF you don't want to wait in line and don't mind taking to go - just walk go their takeout area (store on the left).

Recommendation: 110%.. So I'm here now & I got a steak that came with rice , beans , cheese enchilada & guacamole . It's amazing def will come back service is great as well :). Since I use Yelp for everything, I take reviews seriously and think more people should write about their experiences!!

I went to this location after I went all blonde (Paul Mitchell School of Las Vegas) even though it was a pretty shade it was WAY too Marilyn for my taste and very intense.. Not too mention I already have light brown hair and didn't need to be completely bleached!! 

ESTHER saved my life! She listened to my concerns and provided me with as many options as I could afford (since I'm ballin' on a budget--college smh) 

Esther is a color expert. She foiled my whole head and incorporated four different shades of darker and golden blondes to give me the natural look I wanted. 

She works extremely fast and did my hair and another women's roots and trimmed it and neither one of us were left waiting. (Her roots also turned out awesome-if I do say so myself)

Even with all the amazing work Esther did, since this was a correction job, I did need some more foils on my roots after we dried it all out. No problem for Esther! She went right to it and was happy to make sure my hair was perfect. 

Esther is extremely efficient, professional and energetic. She has a wonderful sense of humor and made me feel confident that my hair would turn out great. 

Thank you, Esther! I will be returning!! Never going to a school again!. Nice hipster vibe with lots of open space. Tried the egg croissant sandwich, which was pretty tasty. The place is located in a strip mall in the middle of nowhere and kind of far from the Strip, but it's a nice trip to get away from all the casinos. 

It's close to The Find, a cool decor/fashion/ accessories store in the next shopping strip.. Booked a Tower Suite for my fiancé and I for a weekend away.  We did it the smart way and stayed Sunday-Wednesday.  These are the "off" days and it saved us a bunch of money in hotel costs.  

We got early check-in which I always love.  Gives us time to settle in before heading out.  Our room was AWESOME.  King size bed with separate sitting area.  Last time I was in Vegas we stayed at Aria and there was an issue with outlets for charging out devices.  MGM had plenty of them!  This made me happy!  

Our bathroom was my fav with a soaking/jetted tub for two.  Created a lot of relaxation time.  

The mini bar had some great items and actually were reasonably priced.  I know that $6 for a beer seems a lot but that's just about the cost if your order downstairs.  We bought bottled water off the strip and would keep it cold in ice/water in the sink.  

Parking was good.  We did valet a few times but it did take awhile to get our car during busy times.  The parking garage was pretty easy to get to as well.  

We ate at some local restaurants and also took in the show, Ka.  My favorite was the spa.  I scheduled their special of the season a honey/milk massage.  It was amazing!  I like the spa area with Jacuzzi and sauna.  I wish I could have taken more advantage of it but we had a full schedule.  

The only downside was that we could hear a lot of noise from outside at night.  This wasn't a huge issue as we would just turn up the TV or put music on to sleep at night.  

I would recommend this hotel, especially the deals you can get during the off-schedule.. I celebrated my birthday here and I'm so glad I did! In between having mini "art-attacks" we laughed until our cheeks hurt. Painting with a Twist and Bricklend ROCK!!! If you haven't tried it, please book a class today and take friends!!. NOTE, this review is for UP dinner. 

A good thing about this restaurant is you can choose down dinner or up dinner, down dinner is casual, and inexpensive, up dinner is dressy and expensive.

We made a reservation a couple hours before our reservation, we stayed at THE hotel. Got there, downstairs was packed, host thought we were tourists who didn't speak English, she was very friendly to us, asked if we wanted to eat here with a hand pose showing ''eating'', that was so funny :) bf said we had a reservation upstairs, then she took us to our table.

Food: 5

Ambience: 5

Total bill for 4 people with 4 alcohol beverages: $415

we went  upstairs, the entire dining section  was so classic and beautiful. there weren't so many ppl, only a few tables ppl were having dinners, and they were older. We got a very cozy and comfy booth, more private too, perfect for our double dinner date evening. 

While waiting for our friends, I ordered dry vodka martini as usual. our server was so friendly, explained everything on the menu, even where the fish came from, or veggies, that was very interesting. He helped us to order the right things from the menu, I had salad and salmon as first and second course, they tasted fantastic. my bf had scallop and roasted duck , they were the same great. our friends had halibut and some other seafood as well, everybody was happy with our dinner. we shared a little bit of everything too, cause the portions were big. 

one of my favorite restaurants in Mandalay bay, up dinner is so nice, great food, great service, beautiful decor, quiet and cozy atmosphere,  it is pricey, but very well worth it. :)

very nice choice for a romantic, quiet, cozy and intimate dinner date. :). Excellent tex mex food and drinks!  My friends and I have gone for dinner but truly their happy hour is THE BEST in town!  The chambord margaritas are to die for!! We also eat the smoked chicken enchiladas and the delicious  catfish beignet appetizers! The beignets are very light battered catfish "fingers" that are served with a southwestern romoulade sauce ( kinda chipotle flavored). The staff are always warm and friendly and take care to serve you promptly.  Definitely a MUST DO dinng experience.. Tried this place a couple of weeks ago on a girls weekend with my mom and sister. It took them a little while to get us seated, but the place was full. I had the chicken parm and it was delicious. I stole a bite from my mom's chicken fried chicken and that was fantastic! We loved it so much we tried to go back again to order to go, but they don't do take out. 

My biggest complaint, which they have no control over, is the smoke from the casino so for the majority of the meal my nose was burning. 

Wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items. 

If you're ever in Las Vegas this place is a must try!. Highly recommend the mussels! They give you a large amount and the taste is out of this world! Great service also! Highly recommend to anyone in the area. I was a big fan of EWC and was bummed that there was only 1 in the Pittsburgh area. UNTIL NOW. So glad EWC has expanded. This location is right in the heart of Squirrel Hill. Metered parking available. 

I love the wax that EWC uses and it's definitely less painful than other the strip wax style. First, they apply a cleanser, then they use a blue-colored wax. It's a bit warm but cools and hardens very quickly. When they're down, they apply a serum to help cut down on ingrowns. You can basically get ANY wax service. They also have a really good program where if you buy a set of waxing services, you get one free. If you wax regularly, it's worth it. 

The front desk people are slightly pushy on selling products but I usually say no thanks and they stop. 

Making appointments are really easy. You can make appointments online too.. Definitely make an appt before you go. I liked the low key sales approach. They told me my fuel injector needed replaced but for $89 I told them I would wait and check with my mechanic after reading the other review. Plan on being there for 45 min though.. Jim is a fantastic sports therapist.  If you are athlete looking to improve your performance, then go to Jim.  You do have to walk through his home (and lounging cats) to go to his outside therapy room (no cats allowed and clean). Jim also has an outdoor hot tub that you can use free of charge before your massage. Jim has hands of steel, so be prepared to get worked!. This place is a hidden gem! It doesn't look like much when you are just walking up to the bar and you have to make sure there isn't a line. We went late Saturday night and had to wait two hours before we were able to sit down, It's first come first serve seating. I was a little taken back at how long we waited BUT it was totally worth it! Once your seated you have a cook and a server right in front of you steaming away the delicious food. The atmosphere is a little different once you sit down, it's a great way to meet new people since you sit next to strangers :) the Palace Pan Roast is what I would suggest for your first time! It's so creamy and full of flavor! And there is a lot of it! The portion is huge! Other than the limited seating, I'd give this place an A++ and will be back soon.. How can you go wrong with Pita?? I mean, are their things I don't like on the menu? Sure. The point is, more times than not I have left tummy full & happy. Service is good, place is always lively and they have great kid plates. Go! It's good.. I'm not a huge fan of pastries or dessert but I went to Manna House daily while in Edinburgh.  This is my cousin's favorite haunts understandably.  The pastries are perfect. I had a chocolate muffin that was chocolaty but not sugary.

I also had a rosemary and chocolate mousse cake. Sounds weird but it was divine. I *still* think about it. The coffee is delicious and the staff is pretty nice.. Enourmous hot and cold sub sammies with a few original creations. Subway and blimpie beware, the Capriottis chain puts you to shame. Their signature sub, the Bobbie is basically Thanksgiving on a hero, freshly in house roasted slabs of carved turkey slathered with homemade stuffing, jellied cranberry sauce and mayo. Both a mess of a dish and one of lifes great guilty pleasures. The Capistrami is loaded with lean hot pastrami, sweet coleslaw, melted cheese and slathered in a robust 1,000 dressing and nicknamed the "shirt killer" as this monstrous hero has ruined many shirts, I'm sure. A lesser known hero and my personal favorite is thr hot italian, a plethora of salamis, hams and other pork products grilled hot the regrilled on the roll, with melted swiss or provolone and roasted sweet and hot peppers. The high grade ham crisps up on the edges and the heat of the meats releases just the right amount of greasy juices that mingle with the sweet and spicty tang of the roasted peppers and the bite of pepper and seasoning in one of te cured salamis makes a heavenly combination.... Alas, there are no Capriotti's near me anymore, though in reality that alone will probably save a year or two of my life. Definitely not for the calorically challenged people out there.. Got the spicy chicken plate with four sides.  Delicious food, however the "sides" are tiny. I asked for a double helping of broccoli and I only got 6 florets  #whitegirlproblems.  Great place otherwise. We came here on no-meat Friday and the parking lot was packed even for early dinner. This is located next to The Orleans. From outside, it looks like your old plain ordinary bar but when you get to the dining area, it's cozy. It's like being at your Irish grandma's home - yup, I'm making that up...I obviously don't have an Irish grandma. The seats are plush.

They have Guinness, Smithwick's, Kilkenny, Harp...and imports such as Chimay, Crabbie's Ginger Beer and Wells Banana Bread Beer. Yum!

All of us ordered the fish and chips. It was sooo good. One of the best I've had ever. Huge portions too. The batter is perfectly light and crisp. The fries weren't seasoned so, season away. The fish and the fries weren't greasy and gross. 

We also ordered the sticky toffee pudding but I didn't get to try it - I'd have to come back after lent.. Ok mind you I grew up with Chompies. as a child we would go bowling and go next door and get bagles on sunday morning. That was near Shea and 32nd street where they first started.

I hadn't been to chompies in years but always bought their goods in the grocery store.  I was expecting the great atmosphere of my childhood.  The brothers in the back cooking and a few New Yorker men up front kicking some customer service ass and getting people their bagels and cream cheese in a quick manner.  

I was disapointed when I arrived at 730 am on a saturday (late as far as I was concerned for a bakery). There were a bevy of beautiful young girls behind the counter no line and It still took me over 15min to get two bagels toasted with cream cheese to go.  Yes I was already in a bad mood but this was totaly flipping me out. I felt like jumping back there and getting it done for them.  

The bagles are still good.  Not as good as I remember them but it hit the spot.

so yes they still get four stars but PLEASE start teaching the help how to get things done a bit quicker.. Today we stopped in for a few drinks after being here last week and being surprised at how great the happy hour is at this location.  If you sit at the bar and get Cynthia count yourself lucky!  Great service. Drinks are priced right and the food comes out quickly.  Ive seen the bad reviews but I just dont get that. 2 times in 2 weeks and I am a happy camper at this hapoy hour.. My dad and i having been using ted weins for a long time now and i was just there the other day to get an oil change. 45 min and they were done, the coupons  are great. They didn't bullsh*t me and didn't try any funny business  because I'm female. So thank you Christian for being awesome and taking car of my little honda because i put that car threw hell :). "Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets..."

This song was playing softly over the speakers on a gray, Monday afternoon as I waited for my lunch at the Marigold Kitchen. On a previous visit to Madison, I remember a tasty al fresco brunch that I enjoyed at a sidewalk table. But my fiance reminded me that it's a great lunch spot as well. Understatement!

I'm a huge fan of goat cheese--okay, who am I kidding? I love all cheeses, which is why I'm oh so happy to be moving to Madison next month! I also have somewhat of an addiction to roasted beets. It goes to reason that I had to order the Baked Goat Cheese Salad with Roasted Beets. 

Oh my. It was divine! The herb-crusted goat cheese had a delightful light crunch on the outside, and silky gooey-ness on the inside. Other stars were of course the ruby red roasted beets, accented by candied orange peel, shallots, and toasted walnuts. Hands-down, the best salad in the "goat-cheese-beets-nuts" category I have ever had.

"Whatever Stina wants, Stina gets..." was now running through my head. I also enjoyed a small soup of the day--ham with wheat berries and bok choy. It sounded so strange that I just couldn't pass it up. And it was incredible: perfectly seasoned and balanced with tender wheaty pearls and graceful bites of bok choy greens. Eating at Marigold, I felt like I hadn't enjoyed real food in weeks...months maybe! I could have eaten there all day. I had plate envy of every other diner sitting around me, because I wanted to try it all. Gluttonous? Perhaps. Delicious? Decidedly so.

One note, dear Marigold: please add a coat hook to the bathroom, as it's nice to not have to put our coats/bags on the floor or try to balance them precariously on the baby-changing station. Merci!. Ben is an extraordinary music teacher!  Our son has been taking lessons for 4 years now and when we moved here from Texas last year we had the daunting task of looking for a new teacher.  Thanks to Groupon, we met Ben and things have never been better!!  He goes above and beyond what I expected from him and my son has improved more in the last 6 months than in all of the years of lessons combined.  Ben has a unique but very effective approach that really works for my son and I am so thankful we met him!  I hope we don't have to ever change teachers again!!!. I just moved to the area and I was very reluctant to get a hair cut in fear that I would be unhappy with it, being that I was not going to my usual hair stylist.  But today, I finally found the courage to try somewhere new.  Fortunately, I found Mosaic salon boutique. I booked an appointment with Lana and she was very willing to fit me into her busy schedule.  

THANK GOODNESS I have found LANA! I am beyond happy and excited about my new haircut.  I have long, wavy/curly hair, so I asked for layers.  She did an amazing job! Not only is she very skilled in what she does, she is easy to talk to and very friendly.  Lana will make you feel comfortable right away because she listens to exactly what you want.  I found Lana based on her great reviews on Yelp, and the reviews about Lana are VERY accurate. So happy I finally have someone to take care of my hair now =) 

*Sadly, I was unable to take a picture today after she cut and blow dried my hair to post with this review.  I will be sure to take one next time.. Sakana has such great food. Everyone is so nice and they greet you the second you walk in the door. Try the cucumber salad. Soooo good!. This market is pretty incredible... not only do they carry a large variety of asian food and kitchen products, but they also have a variety of products from other countries (such as India, Nicaragua, West African, etc.)  Their produce is typically pretty fresh and cheap and they have an extensive variety of meats and fish.  My only complaint is that they do not carry a great deal of seafood.  They have some clams and some tired looking baby octopus, but no mussels, fresh calamari, etc.  

I noticed that they also have a great selection of imported beers (some I had never even seen before).  My bf's kind of a beer conoisseur so I'm always scoping out new products to surprise him with.  

Lee Lee's is a great one-stop shop for ALL your ethnic food needs.  Feel like Thai cuisine tonight? got it.  Mexican? got it.  Cambodian? got it.  Some crazy looking fish? definitely got it.. Excellent customer service! We have had multiple companies for pest control and Blue Sky has definitely been the best. They come out every other month but if you have a problem they will come out in between scheduled services. Techs have always been friendly and polite. I would highly recommend this company.. This will now be my to go to nail salon for my gel mani and pedi. Leslie Johnny Cindy and another guy (I forgot his name) are super nice.. Ambiance:
New, modern décor (a sleek, free standing tub and square sink in the bathroom. Leather, armless chairs, and dark wood dressers) Like other Yelpers, we got a room that was smaller than the pictures Vdara boasts online. We also got a non-strip view. Kind of disappointing but we were on the 34th floor which was nice and high and the night lights of the rest of Vegas were still impressive (though maybe I have lower standards than some).  
Both this hotel and the Aria have a theme of fascinating fixtures and architecture. It's not made to look like Paris, or Italy. It's made to be modern, interesting. I spent most of my time walking looking up at light fixtures or staring at colored glass walls. 

Details:
Complimentary champagne was delivered to our room. Nice.

If you put 4 people in this room, the queen pull out bed? Not comfortable. I want to complain a lot b/c I hated it but my boyfriend was fine with it so that should be noted. We stuck 3 people in the king bed and they slept comfortably. (of course they did. It was a pillow top that I coveted from 1 foot away)

This is a short walk to the Bellagio. Very short. It has a convenient sidewalk connecting it to the Aria. The Aria is connected to the Monte Carlo. What I'm trying to say is, I thought it was relatively close to a lot of casinos. At the beginning of the night we walked to NYNY, Paris, took trams to MGM etc. with ease. At the end of the night an $11 cab ride didn't hurt at all. 

Guests:
The people who stay here are not some guy in his boxers walking the halls on his cell phone (thanks Venetian). They're mature and quiet. The pool side was relaxing. Oh, but there were a few children (some people care about that) I didn't mind. One of them was speaking Italian with his mother.. Can't hate on that!

Service:
Front desk was great. Guy at the Business Center was wonderful but the Concierge (when I asked if there was an evacuation.. the fire alarm lights were blinking) was an @ss. The woman who, at our request, gave us towels and shampoo in lieu of cleaning our room was great too. 

Ultimately, 
This is the place if you're trying to go on a romantic getaway with your significant other. It's not the best for squeezing a ton of friends in the room to go party. It's almost just as convenient to get around as any other on strip location. It's new. And if you're lucky you'll get this through hotwire and have a great hotel at an even better rate. (less than $180/night) I did. And I was oh so happy with my amazing weekend.. The sales associate that assisted me was really great!  He spent the time to help me find the perfect products for my face.  He was patient when I was telling him the details of my problems and which products I had used before. He then told me about the different products they had and which combinations might work best.  He wasn't pushy in trying to get me to purchase the most expensive items, but really on what might help my skin the most.  Excellent experience!. Another of my top 5 sushi picks nationwide.  This restaurant is easy to miss as it doesn't get the hype that many other Vegas venues do, but it is well worth the journey or the stumble (whichever method you happen upon it) to discovery.

The tuna toro (fatty tuna) is phenominal here.  They have an extensive menu for sushi, sashimi and sakes. The atmosphere is very 'Vegas-esque' and it is a great start to a night of fun out on the strip!

Be advised: it is pricey but each mouthful is worth every penny!. It's quite hot lining up so don't forget to bring a bottle of water!  great tourist spot to tick off of a bucket list. You can't get much more authentic than this place!!!! I dare you to try and find a restaurant that brings the flavors of Cuba to Glendale better than this restaurant.

Primero: el cafe Cubano...*check *

Segundo: la ensalada mixta...do not ask where the dressing is. It's already tossed in it and is very refreshing.

Tercero: los moros y cristianos...all fully cooked but a little on the dry side for my taste but the flavor was still there.

Cuarto: el pescado...on point

Quinto: los postres.....aaaaaahhhhh :) :) :)....los postres. Don't ask. Just eat whatever looks good to you and if you can't decide just buy 1 of each para llevar. They are all verrrry good and you will not be disappointed.

Sexto (Yes. That's how you spell it) :p Do not be afraid to use your spanish to order your food. The nice young lady who's running around like a chicken with its head cut off will understand what you want.

I WILL definitely be back. As at any small restaurant everyone is welcome, but repeat customers treated con un poco más cariño.

Buen provecho!. My friend and I were looking for somewhere to get a glass of wine, but were also hungry after an afternoon Christmas shopping. We had in mind a few places on Notre-Dame but couldn't remember everything on offer. "Bar Tapas" of course jumped out at us!

It's only been open for a week, but there were quite a few people in there at 6pm when we arrived, with more arriving afterwards. They do a selection of 5à7 beers and plan a selection of 5à7 wines though those weren't available yet. We had a Chinon at $10 a glass, and a Côteaux de l'Ardèche at $8, both very nice.

The tapas themselves were very varied:

There were typically Spanish ones with a little twist, such as codfish cakes (nice mix of fish and potato, lovely crispy outside perfectly deep-fried but not overdone), lime calamari (not chewy, perfectly battered and deep-fried), garlic butter shrimp (which I didn't have), and the charcuterie plate which included prosciutto and two types of saucisson, as well as cornichons (the French kind), small pickled onions and beetroot.

There were also more innovative dishes, such as harissa chicken (also didn't try), beef with chimichurri (tasty and tender) raïta (based on the Indian condiment), and flambéed saganaki (on my list to try next time).

I particularly liked the selection of salads and vegetables. We had two plates of grilled vegetables (zucchini, peppers and onions in olive oil), but there was also a beet salad and another I can't remember. The bread was super fresh - crusty on the outside and light and airy on the inside.

Apart from the food, I have to recommend the décor, which was "urban reclaimed chic", in perfect keeping with surrounding Griffintown. While the area may be up-and-comingly trendy, the price was more than reasonable. We had 6 dishes (calamari, codfish cakes, charcuterie, 2x grilled veg, beef with chimichurri), and two glasses of wine each, and the whole came to $70 and some change.

On the "to-be-improved" list, service could be a little quicker - there was too long a lag between our first and second rounds, and we spent time trying to catch the server's eye instead of enjoying each other's company. Also, despite asking them to turn up the heating, and despite two glasses of red wine, the place was a little chilly.. The sushi is absolutely fantastic. Some of the top choices: smoked philly, vegas and baked dynamite. VERY fresh and full of flavor. Sake bombers were ON POINT. Kirin beer bottles are HUGE and the sake is served hot (I can't stand cold sake).

The service, however, made them lose a star. We really didn't know who our server was because not one particular person checked on us. Granted, the place was slammed and I'm sure they were running around like headless chickens... but still. It's not acceptable when the chefs are more attentive than the wait staff. 

I'll be returning but I'll sit at the bar next time.. If you are like me, and honestly get seriously depressed by the seemingly endless landscape of soul-less chain stores, mega-malls and Wal-Marts that is Phoenix....

Practical Art is the antidote! My arty, indie, beauty-craving spirit comes alive again, just walking in, seeing this lovely shop filled with tasteful, quality, 100% HANDMADE arts and crafts, all made by local artists right here in Arizona!

I need to take time to look at every single object here. I'm smiling as I think of the quirky items (bee shelters, anyone?) and naturally gorgeous specimens (hollowed mesquite bowls that look like they would be at home in a museum). Practical Art gives me newfound appreciation for the talented artists of Arizona. The shop is beautifully curated by proprietors who have a great eye for design, color and style. 

Prices range from under $10 to several hundreds. And like the name says, it's "practical art" meaning that you can use it in your home. Useful goods for your kitchen, office, or garden, wearable jewelry art and textiles. Many will last for a lifetime or even longer, if properly cared for.

This shop also doubles as an art gallery, with a rotating exhibit of local artists. I was lucky to catch the last day of a beautiful show by photographer Patrick Madigan. They have art openings on First Fridays.

This is a friendly place, no snooty attitude here, and no pushy salespeople. The owners are obviously passionate about supporting local artists and enjoy sharing their knowledge. They might offer you some tea or lemonade while you look around. It even smells good in here.

From now on, this will be my go-to place to shop for cool, one-of-a-kind gifts for special people.

Please support local artists, buy quality handmade goods, and keep money in our local economy!. Great service for more than 10 years.. Great wedding venue, at first I thought it would be too casual but it was perfect for the couple getting married. The banquet rooms are secluded from the rest of the restaurant so it didn't feel like we were in a restaurant...unless you had to go to the bathroom, everyone had to walk through the main dining room. They set up a dance floor in the connecting room. The food was sized perfectly for sharing with a table of 8. My favorites were: eggplant parmesan, angel hair with sausage and chicken piccaca.. My bff and I were staying at the El Cortez for one night, and stumbled into the Fremont Street, uh, area, around dinner time. After wandering all the way to the end, we decided a burger would do us some good. So we wandered all the way back to the beginning, where Brass was. We contemplated which restaurant to go to, because there appeared to be three of them. Just randomly decided to go to Brass- as we're going in, our ID's were checked, and the "bouncer" said an Iron Maiden tribute band was playing that night. Wait, what? Really?

We went up stairs to the bar/lounge/restaurant (I don't really know what to categorize this as), and it was pretty empty. We sat down in a booth, and realized NO ONE was going to come and give us food or drinks. So we went to the bar, got our drinks, and a burger. 

The burger was goooood! It came with tortilla chips instead of fries, which was kinda weird, but I'll go with it. 

We had a good time watching the Metallica tribute band, and the iron maiden tribute band. Although by the time Iron Maiden came on, I was tired of sitting there- why did fake-Metallica get such a long set?

Good food, good drinks, clean. I would've loved to have seen someone on the fake bull.... I have been here a few times and they never disappoint. Great atmosphere and excellent food.  I am craving a margarita as a type.  Yum!. Service at this BYOB was fantastic! On a summer night with a cool breeze, a server brought green fleece blankets to the young girls dining with their parents at the table next to us.
My husband, disappointed to see that most of the menu is pasta (which he doesn't love), ordered the veggie sautée. This turned out to be such an incredible dish- that we have been trying to recreate it at home ever since! This dish was a great surprise that deserves a larger font on the menu! I had pasta with pink vodka sauce, which was amazing! I am very discriminating about my pasta dishes and this is by far the best pink vodka sauce I have ever had. For days I talked about how disappointed I was that I didn't bring the leftovers back to the hotel with us.
The chefs special appetizer was also delicious. It was something that we never would have selected off of a menu, but the menu was prix fix, so we gave it a shot.. Excellent food and service!!!  Be sure to try the octopus appetizer and the lamb!!!!  We will be back!!!!. Riette was amazing. Our wedding was perfect because of all of her help and guidance. You could not ask for a better venue coordinator. She thought of everything I was too stressed to think of and made sure everything went off without a hitch. Bentley Projects was the most perfect and beautiful place to have our wedding. It really was a dream wedding. 

Riette, we love you! You made our day so special, joyful, and stress-free. Thank you for everything.. Magellan was so easy to work with and totally exceeded every expectation! Their amenities covered everything we could've needed and then some. The exposed brick, toys, and comfortable seating made our strategic planning meeting more comfortable and encouraged creativity and idea creation.. Nice brunch on a beautiful day.  The place was still pretty packed at noon (they close at 1pm).  We ordered the eggs benedict, All American breakfast and egg white omelet.  Everything was very good. I'm not a mushroom fan so I didn't try the egg white omelet (it has portabello mushrooms in it).  But the benedict was tasty and teh all american breakfast came with a great biscuit that was super flaky.  Portions are not huge, but satisfying.  Its nice to be able to sit under large historic trees and enjoy the weather and company.  For those who have dogs you can bring them there!  Its a bit on the the pricey side (its no 2.99 special at Denny's), but you pay for the relaxing atmosphere.. Went in for a quick wash and to shampoo the carpet and mats and got just that! They did a really old job on both for the $40 Carpet Express. Not a bad deal! The gentlemen there were very polite and checked on me periodically as I waited. It was about 45 minutes but my mats and floors were pretty dirty so I appreciated them doing a thorough job.. This show was SO much funnier than I would have expected. The only reason we went is because it was the next show to play and I was pleasantly surprised. I would highly suggest this show to anyone who is a fan of comedy.. I give four stars only because i said specifically "no cheese" and when i was about half way done with the first half of my XXXtina the sammy fell apart and i realized it was cheesy.  i don't even want to attempt to finish the second half.  

my employer has ordered from here before and everything was delicious so i know they have amazing food.  i'm just disappointed that my order wasn't made as i requested.  

i'll give them another chance probably, once i get the slimy cheesy taste out of my mouth.. Food was good. Bread and almond butter was delicious! Had tuna tartare and ceviche that was full flavor and close to perfect. Server assistants and Bussers were on top of it but our server was not attentive at all. Will be back for the bar and food!. I've been using my Aeron Size C for about 15 years.  The plastic trim on the seat split open and loosened the mesh component rendering sitting totally impossible.  I called Forum Office Chairs (FOC) and explained the problem.  He said he could fix it and quoted a reasonable price over the phone.  

When I arrived at the office complex where FOC is located (great location btw), I noticed there was no elevator and was quite distressed at the prospect of having to carry my chair up the stairs.  I was prepared to do it but joyfully, the owner came downstairs in a flash, and brought it up himself!

Once we were in his workshop, he looked it over and said it would be ready in a few minutes.  WOW!  I was not expecting that at all!  I was thinking I would be without my trusty chair for at least ten days.  We were in and out of there in under 20 minutes.  And he carried my chair down the stairs and placed it in my car!  

I am very impressed with Forum Office Chairs!  The owner is friendly, charming, and very knowledgeable about the Herman Miller products.  Awesome business!  I definitely recommend this company to people or companies looking for Aeron chairs and those who have chairs requiring a little TLC!. I'm glad that I found this place I have been coming here for over 3 years and will never go anywhere else . They do a fabulous job and I never have any complaints . And yes they do hand wash your vehicle it doesn't go through a machine wash . If you look through their windows they only have machines putting solution on and then people are washing it - just had to clarify because some people are not convinced on that part . They are kind and courteous . You can even wait inside for your car . And the cashier April is amazing ! She is always super nice and always smiling  great place to get your car washed !!!!. In town on business, found this delightfully delicious Thai place. Top three things that impressed me? 1) Open late. 2) Excellent won tons. 3) Fast and friendly service.  I also had the yellow curry, which was delicious.  My order was to go and they provided me with water while I waited.. Very nice airline. The screen in the front will definitely keep kids occupied. Just make sure you bring your own headphones. You can play games, watch certain tv shows and movies for free. Listen to music for free. Nice attendants. 
The only downside of this airline is that it cost $20 to check in a bag. I personally like to check in bags. So if you're going to check in a bag or two, fly southwest. Also, the wifi isn't free on Virgin anymore. You have to pay. I guess it would be worth it if your flight was super long, but flying from San Francisco to Vegas isn't worth it.. Seemed very tame this year, but it's kinda nice to not walk into a festival/pride event without overextending my jaw tendons for the next six months.  The drinks were good tho.

It was very family-like, which is great.  It's the "real" gays and lesbians out there.  The ones that stay away from pride events usually.

It was nice.

The only sad thing was that I stopped at the Human Rights Campaign booth and they told me about the lack of funds to go against Prop 102.

That was the most depressing part of the whole thing.. Superior service! Greeted when I walked in the door even though there was another customer already speaking with an employee. The quoted price was exactly what I was charged. It was ready sooner than they said it would be. Had the glass replaced on an iPad 3 for $130. I will probably have them do my cell phone since it has cracks too. 

The iPad 3 looks brand new. If there was a 6th star, I would give them all 6!. Happy hour at Rock Bottom, 2 thumbs up!  Good prices, the pizza is delicious, drinks are a few dollars off the regular price, good service, and the atmosphere is always casual and fun.. My husband took me here for our anniversary.  This place is beautiful! We got here a couple minutes early and went to the bar and had a couple drinks. We were then seated at our table and resented with the menu. Everything looked so delicious we had a hard time deciding. Every course was perfect and beautifully presented. the best for me was the Orecchiette con Salsiccia, past shaped like pig ears with sausage. It was soooo good.  For the main dish my husband got stuffed veal, I had to steal a couple bites :), and I got a seasonal fish, I forget what it was called. We ordered a dessert, the Baba cake, not knowing that they were going to serve us an Anniversary dessert, $9, since my husband told them our special occasion when he made the reservation. Still it was wonderful, 2 cannolis served on a plate with "Buon Anniversario" written on the plate. 

I just wish it wasn't so chilly outside because the patio looked like a lovely place to sit when the weather is right.. I've always been reluctant when it comes to chiropractors, but I feel so fortunate to have found Dr Vuong to help relieve my neck pain as well as numbness issues related to a recent knee injury.  My wait time was practically nothing because he was so punctual, he helped me feel comfortable and relaxed about the entire process, and he really listened to my problems and concerns!  The spinal adjustment provided immediate results for me, and it felt incredible how 'simply' re-aligning one's vertebrae could create a beneficial domino effect for the rest of the body.  I was impressed too that he took the time to fully explain the details of my condition and how he could fix it.  His staff was also super friendly and knowledgeable, and their therapeutic pillows are a godsend!  (Finally, no more waking up with a crooked neck or pinched nerve in the mornings!)  This is the first time I can actually say that I'm looking forward to my next doctor's visit.  Thank you, Dr Vuong and crew!!!   For anyone wanting chiropractic services with outstanding expertise and a truly caring bedside manner, look no further than the staff at Active Health Chiropractic!  :D. Lisa did a fantastic job threading my brows and was able to fit me in on such short notice! So stoked to have a capable brow professional!. This place is awesome!  I have a thing for falafel and it's pretty hard to find decent greek street food in this town.  I'm also not very adventurous when it comes to trying new restaurants. But when I saw they had falafel, I had to try it. I've tried the Gyros plate, the Falafel plate, the hummus, and several of the pita sandwiches. The large size pitas are huge. My fiance can barely finish and he's usually a bottomless pit.  The fries are crispy, the gyros meat is nicely done and the falafel is perfect--spicy/cumin-y but not overpowering, crispy outside, perfectly dense (but not too dense, ugh!) inside.  The hummus is some of the best I've had in Phoenix and the rice is really good, too, although it seems like they've changed it lately to be all rice instead of rice and fideo. The staff is very nice and the decor is clean and pleasant .  Thank you, thank you Mr Business Owner for opening this place. Keep cookin'!. My husband and I found this place on Yelp and decided to try it out.  We could not be happier!  The owners have to be the friendliest guys we have ever met.  We called them to ask about specials and they totally hooked us up and when my husband went to pick the pizza up they were the friendliest people you could ever want to meet.  Very personal....and the pizza, wings and garlic knots were AMAZING!!!!!  and you can't beat the price.....we found our new pizza place that we will be very loyal to......they are a MUST!. We had a Groupon so we decided to stop in for lunch this past Monday.  It's located in the Hawaiian Marketplace. Parking is $5!!  However, someone else's Yelp review said if you tell the lot guard you're eating at Fuku he won't charge you and you just have to show a receipt later?  Anyway, with the $5 parking, the Groupon kind of washes out, lol.

However, the food is so worth it. I've only ever eaten Fuku to go, so I've never been able to experience a fresh off the grill burger and OMG it's amazing.  I got the tamago burger and the egg was cooked exactly how I love it, runny as you bite into it.  I love how the burger is so freakin' juicy but the bread never gets soggy.  There's some sort of magic to that.

People rave about the crack sauce, but i don't find it especially interesting.  I love the garlic seasoned fries dipped in ranch or ketchup. So yummy!

The place is small and bathrooms are a bit of a walk into the main building, but it's clean and and the booths aren't crammed together.  The service is okay as well.  The music is really loud so it's hard to have a conversation without yelling, but we didn't mind.. My husband and I always choose The Parlor whenever we want to go out and we've never had a bad experience. The staff is always friendly and helpful. We love sitting in the bar area where it's always clean and the bartenders are very knowledgeable about the seasonal beers they have. AMAZING food especially the wide variety of pizzas to choose from and other great dishes.. Anna's Linens is the first place I go when I need bedding, etc... because their prices are fabulous. I went there to do some shopping for a gift and bought a sheet set and a comforter. Well, I was distracted and left without the comforter. Two days later I noticed it when I went to my trunk to wrap the gift. I went back to the store and explained my dilemma. The store was fabulous about the whole thing. They went into the back and checked the cameras and saw that I did leave the comforter at the cashier. They gave me a replacement with no hassles and the whole process only took about 15 minutes, including the store checking the cameras. I feel that this was definitely above and beyond and really excellent customer service. Thank you Anna's Linens!. After an anxious six week wait, the night finally came for dinner at Joe Beef! 

Pros:
1. Service is impeccable. All of the staff is very knowledgeable, in-tune with the menu and attentive to allergies. They checked back at just the right frequency. No complaints at all here. 

2. Food is definitely above average. Snow crab legs were incredible -- As our server said, they are in season right now so they were very sweet and didn't even need condiments. The lamb sausage was a tad too salty in my opinion and could have used more starch or veggie on the side to balance that out. The strip steak was flavourful but a little more tough than expected. The fries were cute in a mini Creuset but pretty standard in terms of taste. 

Cons: 
1. Menu is only in French and on the blackboard. Being fully bilingual, I didn't mind at all that the menu was in French. More importantly, I just don't think it is practical to have the only version of the menu on the single blackboard that half the restaurant has their back up against. The ONLY thing that partially made up for it was the detail-oriented servers who could cater to individual questions. It just seemed like a bit of a drag for the server to repeat the menu so many times. 

2. In terms of value, sad to say that Joe Beef didn't live up to the hype this time. I'm all about paying good money for dinner but we both agreed that the meal just didn't live up to the long wait for reservations and the price.

To try next time: 
- Lobster spaghetti 
- Rib steak for 2. OK, here's the deal: don't go to the Stable Grill. Go to the Stone House. I have actually never eaten in the Stable, and I always feel like a total genius when I have a drink there after dinner and see tons of people waiting on a table for fish fry at 9:00.  I've always gone with a reservation, but I've even made the reservation 20 minutes before showing up. Super easy. 

Eating in the Stone House feels very old school, and it's definitely an older crowd than the Stable. It feels like you're eating in someone's cool great-aunt's house, with old pictures of Wisconsin and famous people on the walls, fresh flowers on the tables. The menu focuses on Wisconsin traditional foods, and each dish has a short story that goes with it, which is kind of cool. My boyfriend had the duck, which came with a cherry sauce that was dynamite, though the duck was slightly overdone. I got the fish fry with their cheesy potatoes, which are awesome.  Dinner always comes with some kind of freshly baked, still-warm muffin or roll, which are always different, and so adds something special to each experience. The last time I was there it was some kind of cranberry-orange muffin, which was awesome. They make a perfect Old Fashioned as well.

To me, this is a quintessential Wisconsin experience. If you have family in from out of state, this is a great spot to take them to. Just make a reservation at the Stone House, and then you have an excuse to walk through the underground tunnel/wine cellar to get to the Stable for a nightcap.. Been coming here for years- just to see the airplanes landing for FREE and I didn't know the official name for this place! Some people would hang out in their cars away from the wind and the noise (hmm, could they be?), others sit on the hood of the car, and yet others, are up close and personal with the fence, literally, noses pressed (kids). 

There was one place in the Bay Area, where I would escape to, and it was Ocean Beach (still my favorite beach there- don't ask me why, just holds a special place in my heart), for years, this was the place for me to chill and reflect; quiet time, no problem seemed too big here. Apparently, others feel the same. For the most part, other people are doing the same exact thing- looking at the planes landing, and wouldn't bother you. Usually this would be a night-time visit. I think I came here once (after clubbing) in the morning, but it got really bright. There's a gas station/mini-mart down the way, if you wanted to get coffee or a sweet treat to enjoy while you're watching these planes.. Denise is very professional and does an exceptional job. I would recommend her to anyone. She takes the time to explain everything and answers all your questions. Would not go anywhere else.. I go to Martha's as often as possible after a tip came from some girls i worked with-
I LOVE it! Delicious sandwiches and salads.
I highly recommend it to all of my friends and make excuses to have lunch dates so I can go there.. I had eaten at a sushi place in the same location maybe a year or so ago (sinobi, i think?), and was less than impressed. So even though the name had changed a couple times, I was rather hesitant...

I shouldn't have been. I got the #3 special, which was a (spicy) tuna roll and (spicy) salmon roll with choice of soup or salad (i got salad) and it was excellent!! Plus only cost 12.95...

It was a very good spice level without compromising flavor, the fish tasted fresh and was good quality, and the portion was great (plenty of food). Not to mention the extremely personable staff.

I didn't try any of their more complex maki rolls, but saw some pass me after ordering and wondered if I should have... they looked great!

I normally don't post reviews, just glean the wisdom of others, but I truly felt the need to compliment this place after my visit.. Oh my word! Just tried this place for the first time tonight and am in love! The food is so so so so so so good! It's very filling and I couldn't finish even half my meal. I got the Veggie Griller Naanwich (minus the eggplant and mushrooms) and it was soooo good! The sauce they use with it made me want to keep eating it. So flavorful and so yummy! 5 stars!!! :)!! I'd give more if I could! I loved it! Authentic and tasty. Great place all around!. Always fast and has shown integrity by telling me I didn't need a service I thought I might need.  Nate is super honest and helpful.  Recommended.. I'm not sure why people had been so down on this place -- after reading several negative reviews I was a bit worried about going.

DH and I are trying to make a "date night" every week or so and this was naturally one of the places that came up -- why not try something new?  We went on a Thursday night and payed for the unlimited play and got started.  I was instantly drawn to an old-school Pac Man game and played several games in a row before venturing out to see what else there was.

Tons of pinball machines, shooter games, old arcade games, driving games, skeeball (you DO have to pay for this, though), pool, and duckpin bowling (also a bit extra) were among the offerings.  We had great fun playing an assortment of the games and the hours flew by fast!

I would say it was a pretty crummy date -- not because I didn't have fun, but because it isn't exactly a great place to connect and spend some quality time with your partner -- but it would be a cool place to hang out with friends and kill time.. Highly recommended! I took advantage of their promotion one day and found myself coming back as a regular. I have seen the same waxer for the past two years. They have helped me out with my brushy needs while on Accutane. At the time, My skin was sensitive and wasn't able to wax, but still they still took care of me.  Highly recommended!. So ich war heute hier zufällig speisen und muss sagen das ich rundum zufireden war.

Gastraum hell / freundlich / sauber

Bedienung nett / schnell / freundlich

Zum essen kann ich sagen der ziegenkäse als Vorspeise ist zu empfehlen ebenso auch die Grillgerichte jedes fleisch war ordentlich gegart und nicht trocken oder zäh und das hackfleisch war auch nicht wie schon erlebt versalzen sondern angenehm gewürzt.

Die speisen sind schön angerichtet und schmackhaft und entsprechen im vollen umfang dem anspruch der gut bürgerlichen küche. 

Portionen empfinde ich als Groß.

es gibt zur auch Angebote zb. zum mittagstisch oder an bestimmten tagen die ich am nachbartisch sah und die auch sehr gut aussahen.

Angenehm finde ich auch das der zum bestellten gericht dazugehörige Salatteller an einem Salatbuffet selber zusammengestellt werden kann.

Ich werde sicherlich wieder vorbeikommen und kann diese lokalität uneingeschränkt empfehlen.. Guest list = free for girls, $50 for guys (yikes! I wonder what it is without guest list...) 

But my favorite club of all time (in Honolulu or Los Angeles) so far.

Got in no wait at 9:30ish to the Guest-list line (2nd floor to the right), there were lots of lines to navigate through). 

Elevators up, main floor. "the library" themed room with sexy librarians standing around, a pool table and lots of seating. "boombox room" downstairs with a tiny floor and more private seating.

I loved the outside portion with parka-ed dancers and fire lamps for warmth.

Drinks are the usual $12, and ehh not too strong not weak but could be better. 

Bouncers and guards were so nice and joked with us about not letting us into the stairs area. Nicest guards I've met on the strip so far.

Lots of space, different places to go depending on mood, 5 bars to choose from, 4 areas to roam... Good DJ, nice guards. High price for guys so high female to male ratio (good if you're a rich guy or gold digger).. My boyfriend and I have been here on several occasions. The staff is always pleasant and is always more than eager to accommodate any requests. The food is always fresh and the dishes are made to perfection. Happy hour is a plus!. ABSOLUTELY Love this place!  We dined twice here while staying at ARIA and were not dissapointed. The staff and food were top notch and prices are reasonable.  Abiance is fabulous and we cannot wait to dine here again -. I like how fast and fresh the food is at Baja Fresh. They also have a nice salsa bar. Much better quality than Taco Bell. (Though I do love me some Taco Bell). Facials and waxing are the only things I'm rating this euphoria on because I haven't had any other services done here.  

I've been going to this Euphoria for about four years  (they recently changed locations about two minutes south on Stephanie from the old location) and won't see anyone else to get my eyebrows done. Joanne is phenomenal. The appointments are prompt and the staff is great!

Since I've been going to Joanne for so long she knows my skin type and her recommends for products are spot on. She won't try to upsell and always recommends things that are really going to improve how my skin looks and feels. The products are a little on the pricey side but they last for a bit (i.e. the skin cleanser  I use is about 40 bucks, but lasts 6 months). She walks me through how to use the product and lets me know how long they should last, how much to use, how often, etc.  Since I have such problem skin, when I get facials, she'll adjust them for my skin type to minimize irritation.  She really values customer service and will go out of her way to make sure your experience is a great one. 

Lee, the manager, is so sweet-always so friendly and trains her staff well in customer service! This location is pretty out of my way, but I keep coming back because the service is consistently excellent.. Love it! The bruschetta is amazing! Ambience is nice although it is quite loud. This is not the place to go if you want to have an in depth conversation unless you want to yell back and forth. But who cares if there is wine involved! So grateful they decided to expand to Gilbert. Downtown Gilbert needed a face lift and Postino has certainly added character to this sleepy suburb.. We loved the rich, smoked, pulled pork and BBQ chicken....you can taste the TLC!  We were passing through to FLA and planned to stop on our return trip!  Absolutely delicious, simple home cooking with pride in the end result.   It's all about the meat; the sauces are optional.  The sides were delicious too; the green beans were flavorful and mustard based cole slaw a twist on an old traditional dish.  Lots of dinner options; something  for everyone.  You'll leave happy and wanting to return!. Great food! Friendly and warm welcome with fast service. The appetizer dishes were to die for!!! Tasty kebabs too! Definitely would recommend!. If you want blah pizza go to Pizza Hut. But if you want cheesy, tangy, saucy pizza, come to Florencia! I am from NY and I was really pleasantly surprised by this little gem. I am what you'd probably call 'a pizza snob.' I am REALLY hard to please when it comes to my pizza. NYC has some of the best NY style pizza in the world (I'm not even going to touch Chicago style. THAT'S a different review and I don't need my house toilet papered.)  Florencia's does their pizza right and they know good service. Everyone there was so nice. I only have two complaints. One is the size of the large pizza. It is a little disappointing. It looks very small for a large. Second, and this is just personal preference, I prefer my crust to be a little on the crispy side. Their crust becomes a little soggy. It just doesn't stand up to the sauce very well. But other than that, the pizza tastes amazing! And their prices are pretty reasonable, too. Unfortunately, I won't be going back because they aren't close to where I live (I was visiting a friend across town). If you're listening, Florencia's, you need to open up a 2nd location up in North Phoenix where I am. There are few decent places to get pizza up here. Come save us!. I've stayed in another Hostel before but it cannot even be compared to this one. This place is so cool and full of friendly people. From the moment I check in, to the moment I left, all the people at the front the desk were super helpful and friendly to me. They help me planning my trip and they gave me great tips of how to enjoy my day better. The room was very clean, and the little lamp on top of which bed it's a genius idea. I'll recommend this place to all my friends and yelp users. I just didn't give a 5 stars because I think they could make breakfast a little more fun. But for the price we pay still a great deal.. After several different friend highly recommending Comptoir 21 (@Comptoir21Fish), we just had to drop by and it end up being the first stop of our 3 day Montreal trip.

The menu is pretty simple with mainly Fish &amp; Chips (duh) selection and includes other things like hotdog and burger for the non-fish eater.

Love the U-shaped bar table where the waitress can bring everything from kitchen to table. The space was rather small and you may need to wait a bit for a seat but the turnaround is pretty quick.

Homemade Clam Chowder $5.95
~ We started with their New England style chowder and it was rich, creamy and super thick.

You can choose form Fish only, Fish&amp;Chips, Fish&amp;Poutine and Fish&amp;Salad and comes in half size, small size and full size.

Large Fish &amp; Poutine $15.95
~ This was the full size version which comes with 3 big piece of fish. It was light and fluffy in a crispy battered perfection plus love how the fish was piping hot when you cut into it.
~ It also came with a choice of sauces and we choose the original tartar sauce and that was the only thing I didn't like about the whole dish.
~ The tartar sauce was a tad bland with not enough "sour/tart" in it and wish they was bigger bits of pickles in it.
~ The poutine was surprisingly good with the traditional thick gravy and cheese curds.

Large Fish &amp; Salad $15.95
~ Side of salad is a much healthier option and a welcoming refreshing to the deep fried fish.

Love the spray bottle of vinegar, no soggy fries from heavy hand or "pour-too-much-accident" here

Verdict:
~ Love it, would definitely come back when in Montreal in the future.
~ Very well price yummy deep fried cod fish with the perfect poutine on the side. Habib is the best tailor in Las Vegas. I'm really petite so I have to get my pants, shorts & dresses fitted to my smaller size. Every time I see him I'm so satisfied with his work, I bring more clothes for him to tailor each time. His prices are reasonable and he finishes within a few days. If you tell him you need it by a certain date, he will make sure to finish it by that date. 

Good tailoring can make an outfit go from blah to outstanding. If you spend a bit of money on clothing, but it doesn't fit right, it doesn't look good regardless of how expensive it is. It's worth spending the extra money to make it fit & feel comfortable and also look amazing on. He even does style adjustments to my clothes. I tell him I want to make a shirt a crop top and it comes out looking like I bought it that way. I definitely recommend looking at your wardrobe to see what would look better if it fit right, then go see Habib. He's made my wardrobe fabulous.. I had a facial by Natalia. It was AMAZING! So relaxing and such a beautiful place. Great location and great prices. I will definitly return.
I especially loved the hand massage I received. After a week in the sun my skin felt so great after my organic facial.. I came here for lunch once because most of the restaurants in this area are fantastic. It's South Park, of course they're fantastic. 

I'd rate the food 5 stars. I'd also rate the service, restaurant location, and interior decor 5 stars too. I went alone for this visit and the waiter asked if I would like some reading material. When I told him I'd like that, he came back with the day's Charlotte newspaper and a South Park monthly magazine. As you can tell, phenomenal service.

For my visit I had the lobster bisque and pork chop for my meal, both of which I could eat again because they were just so good. Definitely need to make more visits there.. I was in Charlotte for an interview and after spending my morning getting interrogated with tough technical questions, I needed an afternoon drink (or 3) to get my good mood back. I'd bookmarked a handful of breweries but was bummed to find that none of them were open as early as I was ready to go tasting, so when I saw that Heist was open early AND had food, I headed straight over and found myself a seat at the bar.

I didn't know much about their beer before arriving, but was delighted to discover that they do a great balanced Belgian. Louisa, my awesome bartender was happy to let me try a few things, recommend new options based on my preferences and even told me I made the perfect choice for lunch in going with the mac and cheese flatbread (carbs on carbs, you guys!). I tried most of what they had on tap and selected three different pints, my fave being the Out to Pasture. Nothing was two sweet and they did have an american style IPA on tap for those of you that prefer a hoppier beer. 

It was busier than I would have thought for Friday lunchtime, so good for them for being busy. If I ever find myself back in Charlotte I'll totally be back for more yummy beer, pretty good food and awesome service.. My husband and I went in for Breakfast. We were sat right away. Good coffee excellent fresh squeezed oj. Our waitress was prompt and attentive. I had the corn beef hash. Some of the best hash I have ever had, eggs cooked over medium were perfect. Husband had bacon and eggs. He was very satisfied aswell. 

Bonus free pie because it was husband birthday.. My husband and I went here for lunch. 

The downsides - 
At that time of day, you can be blinded by the sun if you sit next to the windows.
Our mains arrived mere minutes after our appetizers did. The apps arrived when I expected them, the mains arrived way too soon.

The positives - 
Good food, good ambiance.. 

I would love to try the dinner menu after all of the timing issues are solved.. I have zero complaints. Defalcos is INCREDIBLE. Their food is great, everything is fresh.  The employees are such nice people. I love defalcos.  Its not cheap but you get good value here. Well worth it.. CPR re-certification is just something you have to do as a healthcare professional.  We all moan and groan about it because there are a hundred other things you'd rather be doing for 3hrs. 
However, I've been going to Heart Savers for quite a few years now and they have managed to streamline their system pretty well. When you call to make your appointment you have to be pretty specific on which re-cert you need. I was one of three professionals in my class and only the three of us needed to demonstrate the two-man CPR at then end of class. There were a few taking first aide, who stayed later, so the class was a mix. 
The instructor Moira had a great attitude, and kept the class moving along pretty well. She followed two handouts that were passed out on infant/child/adult CPR outlining technique as well as laws involved and our responsibilities if we as bystanders opt to perform CPR on a victim. She also covered choking in each age category. 
The hands-on skills portion went very quickly with three teams rotating to perform skills on the infant, child, and adult mannequins. A second instructor was brought in to help the class run quickly. I don't recall his name but he was equally as good and had a good sense of humor.
 Each student has their own mannequin but the skills are performed as a group in unison so it's much faster than classes I've been to in the past where each person has to sit around and watch everyone individually.
Those of us in the professionals course took a written multiple choice quiz at the end (we were allowed to work on it throughout the class), and after three hours we're all set for the next two years!
One note I'll mention is that pricing appears to vary greatly. I don't understand how they price it at all as each person seemed to pay differently. I was quoted at $35 over the phone, so that's what I paid, and I think that's fair.  But I heard cheaper rates being quoted in class, as well as higher ones (you pay once you get to class).. Very organized, efficient workout. Clean facility, with a friendly, high energy staff. Workouts I've done are intense and could probably do a couple times a week.  I would welcome a little more individual constructive criticism, because that's what I'm used to in the usual gym I workout at, but understandable when there are 25 people in a class.. Such a cute little place with a nice staff ad good treats!! The gelato was delicious and they have a nice quiet patio. It's a little hidden but it's so nice to find small local businesses to support and this one is worth it!. We got discounted tickets( $22)at Costco that included free soft drink coupons & let us skip the lines . Great value . We arrived around 4 pm on a scorching 100* Friday,at the beginning of summer. This let us enjoy amazingly short lines in the hours before Night Splash ( discount twilight admission 7-10pm) " Night Splash" could also be known as " teen nite" though anyone can stay. The two 13 year olds we brought reveled in the " party music" and atmosphere. Lots of security around made us feel safe to let them " enjoy some big kid freedom", checking in regularly . Though we sat on the side lines watching literally 1000s of kids mingle that nite , none of them were smoking , or vape-ing, or being mean or rough towards each other . Seemed like a great place for teens to celebrate the summer. The staff is young , but were all attentive & nice the day we went.Be aware there is a limited food menu for Nite Splash. Not much "real food" or dinner . Had to leave sun-splash & go next door to Golfland for pizza , which was cooked fresh and price was average . Not bad.  
I guess the only reason to give 4 not 5 is the park is older , (as in " Bill&Teds ExcellentAdventure" 80s retro older,)SO
"regular"price seemed high & discounts were hard to find --glad we are with Costco. If you go during discounted hours , the lines for the slides get very long... So,Uh , don't be cheap? ---  AND not knowing we would be unable to get any "real food " -as in Dinner -in the park from 7-10 was a bummer .Also no pace to hook or shelves to place your things on , in the showers and changing rooms and toilets when the floor stays wet(gross BTW--- how about some tea-tree eucalyptus  or pine sol ?) No door hooks? That is super inconvenient . But we did have a REALLY GOOD TIME .so I would recommend Sun Splash , especially for teens .. The atmosphere here is great, from the decor, to the music to the service, there is a very great feel. 

The food is decent, however, it is not traditional Irish food, it is more Irish food with an American twist. The bangers were not quite right(not sure if they were actually real bangers), which kind of threw off the taste of the sausage rolls. Still the food was good.

One thing I that kind of shocked me was the 'live entertainment tax' which kind of sucked since it was almost $5. I have never payed that here in CA, so I wasn't expecting it. 

The 'Irish band' was also a tad disappointing, they played many American songs, and not a lot of folk songs like I was expecting. They all were great musicians though and had great voices. 

Overall not a bad pub, reminded me a lot of the pubs of Southern Ireland.. Just got pizza and cheese Danishes. It was so good will be back again before we leave.. We LOVE this place and go at least 3 times a week..Best place ever. My favorite is red velvet and ice cream.... Great sushi place. Staff was quick and responsive, chef was cool. We sat at the bar and we got appetizers and they were all delicious, sashimi platter, seared fish, crab rangoons and for dinner we had three rolls, all delicious! Happy hour special was half price appetizers and house special rolls with a discount. Trendy cool place, a little pricey for sushi but I guess you pay for the atmosphere and ambiance.
Will definitely go back.. As others have mentioned, it does seem a bit creepy deepy to a) review a cemetery and b) also see the categories for this location as "Funeral Services & Cemeteries" AND "Active Life." However, that's a perfect description of Elmwood Cemetery. It is a stunning space of lush green grass, ancient trees and flowering bushes and home to some of the oldest resting places in Charlotte. 

During the daylight hours, this space is a breeding ground for dog walkers, joggers and pensive, respectful photographers. The winding roads are great for anyone who needs a bit of exercise and many of the gravestones are quite beautiful and interesting. Many of the folks buried here were from the same well-established (old money) families who still reside in Charlotte today. 

While it may seem odd to schedule a run in a cemetery, I promise that you won't regret it at Elmwood Cemetery. It's picturesque, interesting and, of course, quite quiet!. I find it hard to find great sushi or korean places in Arizona and was interested to see how Gangnam would live up to serving both! The rave reviews on a new establishment was definitely something that needed to be checked out.

The menu here has good variety with a good assortment of rolls, nigiri as well as Korean stews, casseroles and hot stone rice pots (i.e. bibimbap). However, with an appetite on the smaller end I decided to go for their Sake Bomb and an order of Vegetable Tempura.

The dishes come out with sides (banchan) typically served with Korean meals. Though it isn't the full array of 6, the sides consisted of fish cake, potato and Kim Chi. The fish cake and potato aren't the best I've ever had and seemed to be lacking in flavor. I did love the Kim Chi though, it's tart and spiciness was delicious! As for the Sake Bomb, it was a roll laid flat with Salmon, Spicy Tuna and Avocado. The freshness of the fish is okay and I found that their sushi is on the warmer side, not cold slices of fish (finally). However, it isn't amazing. The tempura was large in portion and had a good crust, but typical in flavor.

Pricing is on the pricier side as with most Japanese or Korean restaurants. Sushi roll was about $12 and tempura was about $6.

Judging by the service you can tell that the establishment is new and working out the kinks, however all the servers were genuinely friendly, sought out answers to questions and forewarned that it was their first day. Though a bit spotty in forgetting certain things, they were attentive, refilled waters and made sure to do frequent check ups on customers. The interior is clean and modern.

Definitely would like to come back to try their Korean dishes and to eat more of their amazing Kim Chi!. Went to get my HD ultrasound at 27 weeks..What and amazing experience staff was very nice! Also purchased the $20 for $40 deal on Yelp. Call to schedule my appointment and had no problems getting the date and time I wanted. When we got there the room is huge u can bring your whole family to share this beautiful experience together!. Tip: It is always REALLY cold in this store, so I recommend bringing a sweater or jacket.

I think the G stands for Global? I always get the name of this place mixed up, because there is a popular international grocery chain called super H. The owner of this place are Koreans, so you will undoubtedly find a ton of Korean grocery here. 

What I love about this place is that it is HUUGE. The prices are also not too shabby, pretty competitively priced for authentic international grocery. The selection includes, Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Indian, Middle Eastern and European. They also have a fresh seafood market in the back!

They've got every imaginable fresh veggie and fruits you can think of, you want Jack Fruit? They got it! Lychee, covered! I wanted to make rosewater lemonade, they got rosewater here and cherry blossom water down the middle eastern section. I thought the couscous at Harris Teeter lacks variety and is pricey, they got you covered. Super cheap couscous with several option and brands to choose from, bingo!

The store is relatively clean compared to most international grocer. Oh, there is also a food court to the right of the store!! There is a Korean noodle/rice joint. A joint selling steam buns and then a pastry shop. Oh, they also sell Asian furnitures!! They also carry Asian toiletries and beauty products, they got your back!

The only complaint is the crowd at this store gets a bit confusing...Once we checked out and turned around to try a sample by the door, we were like 5 inch from our shopping cart but someone had managed to accidentally switch out our shopping cart with theirs all in less than 3 seconds. We were finally able to track down the person in the parking lot, it was an honest mistake. However, this was pretty bizarre of an experience. 

If you like this place and is looking for something similar with a MUCH better food court, try Grand Asia Market. They also have a good selection of Indian, Middle Eastern and Mexican groceries.. I absoulutely love this place!  I go there so often they know me by name and remember my order.  I always get the Honey Chicken Pita Lunch Combo.  It inclues rice and salad and a drink.  The "honey" is for honey mustard.  I know it's weird but the combo of honey mustard and tzatziki sauce tastes awesome with the chicken pita.  Not only is the food good, but it's fast!  I prefer going here to some of the more "authentic" Greek restuarants in town. I have nothing to say that's negative about this place.. So glad they have a place on the main block at central and the plaza now!  Elizabeth is a really cool chick and she knows her stuff.  Great stop for belts and accessories, love her shoes.  Have also found many party dresses here that I have got endless complements on- for under $30!  Don't miss it if you love vintage!. Red velvet pancakes are genius! I should feel guilty eating dessert for breakfast. Nope. Cream cheese icing tops off fluffy red velvet pancakes. Friendly and efficient staff. I highly recommend this place.. Last weekend (or maybe the weekend before...) I wondered into this place because I got caught in a long phone conversation with my friend and didn't want to be that rude person at the nail shop next door yelping away on my phone.  I know this place is big and not crowded and thus it's justified for my rudeness to yelp and shop.

Mind you I wasn't looking for anything in particular, which means Peggy will find a pair of shoes she likes.  I mean, they sell shoes here?!  Apparently they do, and clothes too.  I found this super high heels in a summer-y neutral material for $19! 

Like everyone mentioned, this place has all kind of random things. Great place to shop for virtually useless but cute gifts.  There are jewelry, candle, funny gag gift items, furniture, baby stuffs... did I say shoes!?. I was in town visiting and I decided to go get a pedicure before I hit a night on the town. The staffs were super nice and conversational. It was large, airy and clean. Spa chairs were extra comfy. I got white French tips where I could tell they use quality polish where it didn't chip till about 2 weeks later. Unlike some other nail salons where they use cheap polish and it chips the next day. Great service!. Love this place! Simple and very welcoming. Stopped in for an hour on our way into Phoenix. Can't wait to stop on our way back home. Exactly what this tired mama needed. Already making plans to come back for an overnight stay.. Went on this past Wednesday evening for the first time. They have a small private lot but it was full when I got there at 4pm. There's plenty of street parking around, both paid and free, so you might have to walk a few yards.
The beer menu is a giant chalkboard on one wall. They are numbered for easy ordering and seemed a pretty varied selection. I tried the Moa Breakfast from Moa Brewing, New Zealand and a strawberry blonde from The Brewery in Pine, Arizona. Both were good and very fresh tasting. My dad tried three different IPAs and a couple samples of various beers; he liked them all. I'm do not like IPAs at all but they have plenty of hops-free selections. I was a little sad at their lack of ciders - I was hoping for find a place when at least one new cider on tap but they only had one - Woodchuck - which is good but hardly difficult to find (you can buy a 6-pack of their many varieties at most grocery stores). 
I also got the Churchill Grilled Cheese and their "home made" "Pop Tarts". The grilled cheese is mozzarella and fontina cheese, honey, house pesto, and I added bacon for an additional $1. The tarts were more akin to "toaster strudels" and were really good - the flavour of the day/week was grape. 

The only major problem (which has been mentioned in a few reviews) are the acoustics. When we first arrived, it wasn't bad because it wasn't that busy but by 6pm, it was full and I had to just about yell across our small table to be able to talk to my dad. Not really a place for conversation. 

5 beers, 2 meals, and dessert all came to $70 with a nice tip. A little pricier than I like to go for a dinner but alcohol will easily add up. Nevertheless, I would definitely come back for the selection and the food. Definitely a place to try out when looking for a small, local eatery downtown.. I love this place. Always great food, drinks and service. Not to mention atmosphere style of this restaurant. Well done.. I drive past the taco truck everyday it's parked at coffee buddha on my way home from work. I'm always tempted to stop and never have. I went to the coffee buddha food truck round up this past saturday, and if I would have known what I was missing I would have stopped many, many times on my way home from work already! I ordered the organic curried potato taco with chipotle mango creama. The taco was overstuffed to the point I needed to eat it entirely with a fork. It was very tasty but far too spicy for me to finish. Luckily my dining partner loved the spice and happily finished it. My dining partner ordered the spicy jerk chicken taco with avocado cream. It was the decided favorite of the three we ordered. I ended up finishing this one. It was not spicy to me and the avocado cream blended nicely with the jerk seasoning. The final taco we ordered was the flank steak with brussel sprout kimchi. This was the least favorite but it was still very tasty and beats what you could get at most local mexican restaurants. I short, do yourself a favor and visit the pittsburgh taco truck-your tummy will thank you!. Good food at a decent price. Huge sizes as well for a family of three we could have eaten one meal not three that we ordered. The bathrooms were gross but the food was great!. This is by far the BIGGEST H&M store I have ever been to because it has three spacious floors full of clothes and accessories. (The third floor mainly consists of children's clothing.)

By the way, THEY HAD AN AMAZING DJ!!! The customers and employees were all having a good time dancing to the music. I didn't want to leave since I was having such a good time. I think I stayed there for over 3 hours. :X



CLEANLINESS:
The store was very clean and organized despite all the sales they had going on.

SERVICE:
The staff were all extremely nice. I got into the fitting room and paid for my clothing with no hassle. There was a long line, but it moved quickly because of the awesome employees.

CLOTHING:
The clothing were very well organized and easy to see. This made my shopping experience so much easier and better. All of their clothing were neatly folded/hung and fully stocked. Some clothing were on the pricier side but some were a definitely a steal!



The wide selection of clothing, great customer service, and the awesome DJ won me over. Good job H&M!. One on one with the PT-great attention and knowledge. Alex Delgado had an excellent routine and I felt very well cared for.. Having the ability to schedule online appointments for the Take Care Clinic PA's and NP's is a much better option for me personally. I have used their services three times during the previous 12 months and each time it has been a pleasant, informative experience.. I have yet to be disappointed. I tried the fish fry tonight, which was catfish and I loved it. French fries. Hush puppies ,creamy coleslaw, and two pieces of fish for 13 bucks?! Sweet!! I had the rib sandwich for lunch as well, amazing and way too much food for lunch. Tonight I noticed a TV, and asked about football, the girl was not sure but said if we asked they would probably turn on a game. Pretty nice. I have to say, I only order carry out because I live nearby so I don't have much to say about atmosphere, but employees are nice. Even though this is a chain I would say that it is one of our top places to eat in CLT. The prices are on the high end but we just keep going back because the food is so good. If you go right after work you can get a great spot on the patio. Our favorite dishes are the spicy eggplant/shrimp appetizer and the beef carpaccio. The eggplant/shrimp dish is scrumptious; it has a very yummy sauce and the carpaccio is HUGE, especially for an appetizer. It comes out in the biggest plate you will ever see and has a tasty salad, flatbread slices and capers on top to make it even better. If you sign up for their rewards card/app, they send a lot of promotions to lessen the pain of the bills. Almost every time I have been in we were able to get at least $10 off by using these offers.. Hands down my favorite café in Vegas. (I'm only speaking for the Summerlin location though because I think the new Southside location sucks.) 

I love coming here for all sorts of reasons; obviously their drinks, pastries, ambiance, etc. It's such a nice place to sit and have a conversation with someone while sipping on a nice cup of Nutella latte or tea. And a couple times I've gone while they had a singer giving acoustic performances. It was so nice. 

I guess the only thing I could complain about is the lack of space in there. The seats are limited and it can get real crowded really fast. But as ironic as it sounds, I kinda don't want them to expand. I'd want it to remain quaint and cozy, like it already is ^_^. This was our first dining experience in Scottsdale and it was the best pizza!  We loved it. Great crust, pick your own toppings, great service, great atmosphere.   We'll definitely go back!. Was looking for a quick bite to eat at the hotel, and since there weren't too many options, we came by here. Large and lively, waitresses dressed in chaps, you got a sense of the Southwest feel here.

Huge mason jars of water or soda, I saw a table nearby with nachos. I had asked the waiter if it was a half or full order, and he said half. It was HUGE! And it was only $8! I was set on that, and a friend also ordered their fried mac and cheese balls. Was excited to try it!

The fried mac and cheese ball was dissapointing. Flavorless, even with their spicy ranch sauce.

When our entrees came out, they were HUGE! No one could finish their food! My nachos were really good, was quite surprised, and we could barely put a dent in it. Their french fries, although could be cooked a little longer, were really tasty as well.

All in all, a good cheap meal, and we left just as the live band started rocking out. A p plus is using your Total Rewards card for a discount as well.. They have always been great for our animals. Very fast and always accomidating.. Attention sprinkled donut lovers: this place is for you!

I have been living in Vegas for 2 years now and have not tried Ronald's Donuts until today. I have driven past the shop on Spring Mountain many many times, but just never had the time, or could not make it during their business hours. Today was one of those days where I woke up super early and had some time to kill before going to work. I was craving a donut to go with my coffee and thought, I think I'll stop at Ronald's!

When I walked in, there were a few people who were enjoying their treats and coffee while reading the newspaper. There was no line, which was awesome. The lady behind the counter was very nice and friendly, with a big smile on her face the entire time. As I was deciding what to get, she explained to me that the top 2 rows were vegan. I got one rainbow sprinkled donut, and a dozen of the vegan glazed donut holes. I took a bite of the sprinkled donut while driving to work, and wow, after that I just could not put it down! This was definitely one of the best tasting donuts I have had in a while. The cake donut was slightly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Very unique and different from the usual items that I get from Krispy Kreme. The icing and sprinkles were just right, not overly sweet. Let's just say I regret not buying a few more!

The vegan donut holes were good, but nothing special. I could not tell that they were vegan because they tasted like your standard donut holes. Prices were very good. I paid a total of $1.80. Awesome! I was very surprised. I even had my $10 bill ready before she gave me my total.

I'm actually glad this place is not close to my house because if it was, I would get into some serious trouble! But, I'll definitely be back for my sprinkled donut!!

Cash Only.. I have been wanting to see this exhibit for a long time and finally got a chance to see it tonight. It is defiantly a must see-and a true experience of the Titanic "feeling". You first are greeted with a boarding pass with a real passengers information - and at the end you get to see if you survied. Then you get to see all the wonderful artifacts from jewelery to money and dishes. My favorite part was the grand staircase which we were able to take pictures on. Also there is a part were it looks like your outside of the deck with all the stars shining really bright...then you get to the part were there is a huge glacier and you get to touch it and feel how cold it is and can only imagine the pain the poor people had to feel when out in the water. It was filled with interesting facts and a real inspiring exhibit. Makes you appreciate life. But a definite "must see" in Vegas.. This theater is my favorite. The recliners are very comfy.  I love going here because you can enjoy your movie without dealing with a lot of excess distractions.  They a little more pricy than other theaters, but it's definately worth it.. Jody you ROCK the scissors :)  Thank you for my new hair style.  You always do an amazing job!!!  I highly recommend this salon.. Here to protect the pit! Rattlers first playoff game. Parking in the US Airways garage is passes only, and the other garage is $12. Lots $15 to park.. This is my VERY favorite Greek Restaurant in the US hands down. The Greek fries are yummy, the hummus is so very fine!  Literally. The lamb is seasoned to perfection and the serving size is huge! Worth every penny!. I love Sakana's, but I wonder if it is the good food or just all of the good memories that I have there.  It was a hot spot for my friends and I many moons ago.  I really had a nice time.  i like the intimate atmosphere and having tried sushi at Sting Rays, Ra, Kona Grill, Kobe, etc.....I think that Sakana's has always been the best.   

This is my favorite sushi restaurant.. Our AC went out 3 days ago. Called a local company. Repairman said we needed whole new HVAC...AC & Furnace. We were told that AC had bad refrigerant leak and condenser was fried, and that our furnace was on last legs and about to kill us with CO poisoning. He could sell us new HVAC System for $9500. Our current system is 10 years old. My husband spoke to his two sons (who've both been in HVAC business) and they told us to find another company and what questions to ask. We called this same company and asked questions...they dismissed our queries & suggestions and insisted that we needed whole new HVAC. I did a YELP search and found "Legacy Air" in Las Vegas. Lots of good reviews, stellar actually. We called and they came out that same day. Our repairman was Dean. What a breath of fresh, honest air!!! At Last! (since we moved here in 2012 we've tried 2 other AC companies without satisfaction, lots of verbiage and no real lasting results). Dean was able to tell us that our furnace was just fine and would last for years to come. He diagnosed our AC with having refrigerant leak, replaced valve caps (with proper type valve caps, which none of the other companies ever did), recharged our system with refrigerant and now everything running smoothly. Legacy Air is the only HVAC company we will use from this point on. I'm sure that all of their service techs are excellent, we were very pleased with Dean.  The whole process was honest, fair and reasonable.. You have to taste it to believe it and even after that you still won't believe that it's not MEAT!!!!

We came here to try something different and were pleasantly surprised at how tasty it actually turned out to be. The atmosphere is very clean, green and zen like. 

Service was great! The older Asian ladies were all very nice and even wrapped up our leftovers for us! 

Hot and Sour soup (bowl)- was nice and spicy but was a bit bland.. Nothing a little low sodium soy sauce won't fix.
"Beef" & Chinese broccoli- They didn't have it on the menu but were willing to make it for us.. Tastes pretty much just like the real thing!!!
Sizzling "Chicken" and Veggies- This was my fav dish of the day. Bell peppers, onions, mushrooms made the dish especially yummy!
Brown Rice: At no extra charge and is included with entrees!!!

The fake meat looked just like real meat and tastes pretty darn similar. I think the texture is what gives it away. The texture is very similar to that of Inari (tofu wrap used at sushi places..) None the less, this place should definitely be bookmarked and is a great healthier alternative to the real stuff!. Great little spot with friendly staff and chill vibe! Go. Here. Nothing better than supporting your local spots. Solid salsa, tasty margs and tacos are bomb-diggity! Ask for Rebecca or Renee. We have been taking our dogs to the Barking Lot for years now. The grooming services are excellent, and the groomers are very friendly and kind to our dogs.. So I have to update my review.  Almost a year later and I'm back at at Vegas Hot!.   I just couldn't survive without Pilates and they had a killer promo going on.  The smell is definitely alot better and the desk staff is more friendly, wooohoo.    The majority of the instructors are great, there's a couple of new ones that just need a little time to get more comfortable with the class.   My only negative is that sometimes the classes are insanely crowded, I understand that Bikram doesn't limit the number of people in a class but good lord if someone's foot is invading my mat space and almost kicking me in the face that's a little crowded, don'tcha think?. Amazing. Best sushi I have had in town!!

They are amazing!! Some of the freshest fish I have eaten, and the chefs know what they are doing, and love their jobs. 

Would recommend to anyone that wants some good food!!. Yummy spring rolls with fresh mint, mouthwatering pho with brisket and another with the most amazing chicken broth I have ever tasted. This place has set the pho standard very high and now what other places have to beat!  I have been spoiled. Who cares if the person who takes the orders has an opinion - mine is the only one that matters and the food is great.. I've been to many locations and have never had a bad meal at any of them.  Great food.  Bang bang shrimp are a favorite as is their house salad dressing (lemon vinaigrette).  Had one of the best steaks I have ever had at their Panama City Beach location (rivaling Ruth's Chris, Blackies House of Beef, and Morton's) which blew me away...  We chatted with their manager and apparently they get first pick of the cuts before their other restaurants and this guy knew how to pick them and it was beautifully cooked.. I really wish we had Firehouse Subs in LA because I love their subs. 

This location has great parking, a very clean restaurant and cute decor. 

Also, the abundant array of sauces to add to your sandwich is a plus.. Portions are huge & the food is delicious!  Will definitely be a returning customer :). I absolutely love frozen yogurt.  Unfortunately a lot of times the variety of flavors is pretty bland.  The flavor here ere great.   You could actually tell which flavor you were eating.  The toppings bar was pretty good.   It had the usual cookies, fruit and candy that most froyo places have.. It is on the pricey side but it is really good.  You first choose what kind of tartar you want, then your sauce and then your side.  You have to pay extra for sides like french fries though as the included choices are chips, croutons or celery.  I am a big fan of the beef tartar with the spicy sauce which has a nice kick to it.   I like to pay extra and get french fries  as they are really good here and come with a tasty mayo for dipping.. These people possess the wow factor!!  Decided after reading about the Knight Rider jewelry in the local paper(I am not the type for that jewelry nor do I know anyone who is) I thought I would take some watches in for batteries and I had a new watch which needed links removed. The store is gorgeous with lots of hershey's chocolates around to help you when you are shopping.  The jewelry is displayed wonderfully.  Anyway I asked how much are batteries and the cost of taking out links and they answered "Nothing!!!"  I responded I never heard of such a thing.  Hamra jewelers charged me $30.00 to remove links, that is why I ask now and why I would never go to Hamra again---tomorrow I may be presented with a bill---I will gladly pay for the service given---if the bill turns out to be exhorbitant you will hear from me, but these people are wonderful (so far!) Beautiful jewelry!!. The food is really awesome here. Hummus and chicken Greek salad is amazing and the chicken is always very well marinated. They give you so much for your money!! I've never been disappointed!! The server is such a nice guy!!. These are un-freakin'-believable. I wish this company would just move in next door to me or something so I could be their friend (and/or rob their stock!). The ingredients and nutritional profile speak for themselves - plus they taste good. Win/win!. Two stellar experiences with this company! On time drivers, squeaky clean cabs, reasonable fares, no funny business, functioning credit card machines, carbon neutral/negative.  WIN!. This review is just for the pools.

For a Sunday afternoon, the main pool was surprisingly empty.  We initially rented daybeds ($75 - what a steal!), that are situated in the center of the pool, so you and your cellulite are prominently on display for everybody.  But it's so windy up in that part of the vegas valley that we were forced to upgrade to one of the cabanas on the perimeter....still a steal at $150.  

The cabanas are beautiful and worth the money - though set a bit to far back from the pool.  They have stacked fridges, water floaties, flat screen, couch, chairs and recliners.  I highly recommend the white sangria with the orchids and fruit (can't remember what it's called, but they only have three - see pic).

We eventually ditched our cabana though and migrated over to the VIP pool where a friend was having her b'day party.  Much cozier, more intimate, more locals, and a good DJ....so much better than the main pool....and significantly more eye candy.   The VIP pool isn't heated though (ummm, yeah, that makes sense) like the main pool, so hold your chi-chi's when you get in.  It's brisk, baby.. Un bon endroit pour un virer une.... avec ses spéciaux 5@7 et les lundis-mardis avec les pintes de Boréale à 5$, parfait pour les étudiants au budget serré. La musique y est forte, mais il y a moyen d'avoir une conversation plus normale sur l'étage du bas, avec des tables plus isolées et des banquettes. La terasse vaut le détour!. I stumbled upon this low profile kosher bakery one night biking up to Park Ex. A friend had recommended it at one point for bread so I thought I'd check out their selection and try a few things. The baked goods are truly homemade, hearty and delicious. Their fresh rye bread is my favorite in the city and I've heard through a very reliable resource that the chala there is divine! 

If you're looking for a fancy atmosphere or any bells and whistles this is not the place for you but if you're in the market for baked goods (specifically good bread and sweets) you'll be happy to get kosher at homemade!

P.S. Apparently all of their goods are produced in a nut-free environment so you can buy worry-free if you have nut allergies!. The spa is beautiful!  The service was a bit spotty.  My masseuse was amazing.  I had just been in a rear end collision and she was able to work all of my knots out.  Feeling much better now.  I would definitely recommend their dry sauna, you know how some sauna's are just too hot, well this one I must say was just perfect.  Avoid the chill room.  It's not snowflakes coming out of the ceiling, it's soap.  It's just kinda uncomfortable and not relaxing at all.  Oh - I don't mind being cold, like I love the cold plunge, the chill room just didn't float my boat.. Try the Chinese buns. Delicious pork belly, marinated vegetables, and pea shoots. One of my new favorite dishes.. This place was great!! My food as well as my coffe was really delicious. Our waitress Sarah was great! they have a deal going if you purchase a entree, you get a free cinnamon roll and can I tell you the cinnamon roll was good all by itself. It was totally different. Very flaky and cream on top was awesome!! If you have not been you must go!!. I may be the worst customer a moving company can deal with. And they dealt with me so well I can't help but give them five stars. 

With all the rave reviews I received from friends and yelp, I couldn't help but choose Camelback to help with my move. I didn't want to have to force my friends to help move my big items. I received a fair quote for moving the large items only. I soon realized though, that it was unrealistic for me to move all the boxes myself. However, I failed to inform them of this. 

When the movers arrived, they found lots of fun stuff to move. Did they complain? No. Did they yell at me? No. Did they tell me they needed more people? No. Did they tell me I had to reschedule? No.

Nothing broke or was destroyed or lost, which has happened in nearly every other move I've ever had done.

They came, moved what was there and did one hell of a job. It took longer, and I paid more, but it was very reasonable for the trick move I played on them. They were even fine when it got to be nightfall and my neighbor boys were running into the moving truck.  Well done. Highly recommended.. We shared a GREAT meatloaf scramble with mashed taters...enough for 4 people. .Steven, our server, was always there with fresh brewed.  Just a yummy fun time...we come here on every visit to Lost Wages.. love their food, great for lunch and breakfast....

the service is a little hit or miss but they always keep your coffee cup full-you will almost always have to ask for extra milk-but whatever.

Love having the breakfast sandwich or their pancakes-my favorite ones are no longer on the menu though :( they had apples, sour cream and honey over them SO GOOD!

Not a place for breakfast cocktails though, so don't anticipate a good bloody mary.   their sandwiches are amazing, I've had several and have never been disappointed. 

Despite the shoty service it's a great spot for breakfast or lunch so definitely give it a try.. Authentic sushi in Vegas... amazing.  Amazing service. Supermarket-sized parking lot.. i love it, it gives me goosebumps!. Adorable and delicious! Fresh juice to the full bar and great happy hour.. Cute and delicious baked goods and yummy fresh ingredients!. I hadn't been to Ruggeri's since last year, when I wrote a review.  But my friend Marla and I stopped here for lunch after a bike ride.  Everything I wrote previously still stands.  My roast beef sandwich was just perfect.  And we split a delicious pasta salad.  We sat outside at one of their little tables.  Forget subway--come here instead.. My usual for lunch is their French Onion soup (which I still say is the best in AZ) and a small caesar salad w/ chicken.  They no longer offer the 1/2 salad and soup deal so your paying a bit more now-a-days but it's worth it.  Both are fabulous!  The caesar dressing is perfectly balanced and the chicken is always moist and flavorful.

I took a cup of chicken noodle soup to a friend as I know their soups are always top notch and this one can heal anything that ails ya!

Make sure you take advantage of the patio now while the weather is perfect!. Great pizza, good customer service, prompt delivery but a bit pricy but worth it.. Would have given this hidden gem of Sin City 5 stars but the cashier that was working today, August 23rd in the AM was not friendly and did not appear to be too happy to be working.

Despite the cold initial greeting, the other staff were friendly, kind and very informative.  The staff appeared to enjoy being with the beautiful animals.  The animals appear spoiled, loved and very well taken care of.  The $20 spent for admission for myself and child was well spent.  

The majority of the animals were sleeping but we were able to see a handler playing ball with the 10 month old cubs, which was super cute.

My 5 year old told everyone about Bentley the lion's 8th birthday today.  It was very cool the the handlers spoke of the animal's birthday.  I was also pleased to see that MJ the lion from the closed down zoo on Rancho was transported to this location and appears to be thriving and healthy.

Definitely would recommend this lion habitat to everyone.  Habitat was clean and the animals appear loved.. All you can eat fresh, delicious sushi for $27 in the hot desert in Las Vegas?  Is this a mirage?  Am I hallucinating?  Nope...it's real.  Sushimon is a must go for me everytime I am in Vegas, EVERYTIME.  

Each time that I eat here, I can't believe that i'm actually eating fresh raw fish that doesn't make me hit the can later.  The sushi rice here is perfect...comes out a little warm with the right amount of vinegar taste that sushi rice should have.  I like that the fish to rice ratio is proportioned right.  Some AYCE's have too much rice, in hopes to fill you up.  Not here.  I love that the AYCE menu is double sided with nigiri, appetizers, dessert and for all you sushi lovers who think you like "sushi" (cooked, battered, fried, saucey rolls) they have a whole side dedicated to you.  They also have specials of the day. Toro, fresh scallop, super white tuna, even mirugai have appeared before so remember to ask your server before you miss out.  The servers are hot and cold...sometimes they are super nice and sometimes they seem like they really hate their job.  It depends on how busy they are i think.  

There are a few items that are limited to one order per person...the uni, amaebi and hamachi kama.  This is understandable considering it's more on the expensive side.  If you love these items, go with someone who doesn't that way you can have their share too!   

Save room for dessert because they have tempura ice cream and it is delicious!  Just a hint of tempura batter so it doesn't over power the ice cream...i wonder how do you fry ice cream?  

If you are a sushi lover and want a great all you can eat experience, you have to come here.  I wish and wish that they would open one up in SF and HI so I don't have to fly to Vegas just to enjoy good quality AYCE sushi.  

TIP:  No reservations and the line can get long so come early or just place your name on the list...they call your phone when your table is ready!. I spent the afternoon here with my 19-month old son for the first time and it was great! The kids area has some nice toys and occupied him for quite a while. We read a few board books and I checked out a couple novels for myself. It's a relatively small library but it has all the necessities. I know we'll be back often and hopefully we'll try some of the offered activities.. The best! My daughter and i love this place. We try to eat here once a week. Try it you won't go wrong!. I first discovered this place years and years ago when I worked at a restaurant across the street. This is the best middle eastern food I have found in or around pittsburgh thus far. I am Syrian and Greek and grew up eating all that yummy stuff, so when I judge middle eastern food I'm comparing to what my great grandparents and grandparents made my whole life. We all know grandparents make the best food ;) love their kibbeh nayeh, moussaka, grape leaves, sleek, and leg of lamb, fetter treat meal....everything I've ever had here was GREAT.  We always get at least 5-6 things to share between 2 people!. Another flawless fantastic meal at SW. Perfect steak, don't miss the truffled cream corn or the grilled asparagus salad.  Wonderful service, great flavors, good wine and delicious cocktails. Really, that's all I have to say about that.. Good korean food for vegas. I really enjoyed the kimchi grilled on the pan and the pork belly. Good place if youre craving meat and korean food. The sevice was really good too.  No ajumas ignoring you when you ask for more food.. Worth it! Don't you get tired of spending a boatload of cash while you're on the Strip, on mediocre food served by apathetic employees? This place is terrific. The prices are quite reasonable and the pizza is delicious. You can customize them, but don't load thin crust pizza up with too many ingredients. Best of all, the staff is friendly, efficient, and quick to clean the dining room. Go! You won't be sorry.. Amazing sushi and martinis!!!. I'm a first time new car buyer and James was very helpful and informative and made my experience enjoyable and fun I've bought used cars before and know the game but James was actually a genuine guy and I didn't need to put any guards up or be cautious he was very to the point straightforward and honest which is a great thing to have especially in this town.. Wow.  What a pleasant surprise.  I am staying at the Doubletree across the street from RBG Grill which is located in the Radisson hotel.  I arrived just as they were setting up for lunch.  I ordered the Big Hippie salad with chicken breast and tater tots. Both were very good.  The chicken was grilled, flavorful, and moist.  The salad consisted of sunflower seeds, red quinoa, mixed green, feta cheese and a lemony vinaigrette dressing.  The atmosphere was very nice as well.  I would definitely came back here again.. This is as authentic as Koreans can get. The food is DELICIOUS! The portions are great, the side dishes are AWSOME, a definite must visit when in town!. In my senior year of college year, and like a quarter of my wardrobe is from Avalon. Yes, can be on the pricey side of thrift stores, but I just take that as a fee for the curating they do. They also started a sale section maybe a year ago, which takes 50% off everything in that rack. 
Notable pieces I've gotten from Avalon: vintage coach purse for $30, levi's denim jacket for $25, j. crew wallet for $12. 
The shoe collection is always on point, as is the jewelry section. I've definitely found some really unique pieces for great prices. Don't be afraid to wander into the men's section if you're a girl--oversized cardigans, jackets and tees can never go wrong. 
Honestly, bottom line is you have to pick and choose--and it's heaven if you know how. Great place to pick up signature pieces for your wardrobe. And if the prices scare you off, come back at the dollar sales they have at the end of each season, or hit the sales rack.. If the campus Espresso Royale and the capitol Espresso Royale were sisters, the capitol Espresso Royale would be the mature older hip sister with a day job while the campus version is the popular underaged hipster wearing whatever is cool these days and probably on WUD. I appreciate the free wireless, that they take credit cards, and plethora of seating choices.
I love the selection of teas, and I do not stand by the house blend but the coffee of the day often suits my palate.  The chai is fabulous and the staff on this side of State Street is WAY friendlier.. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food went well. Fun place to hang out and grab some drinks.. This is such a great shelter. It's no-kill and u can tell the volunteers truly love each animal. Please stop by and visit the furry babies. We got our sweet Ruby from there and the service was fantastic. Guy was great. He really knew about the dogs and helped us find a nice dog to get long with out completed spoiled pretty kitty. Fantastic food and the best part is I can get what ever I want on my plate just like chipotle .. We got married in vegas Feb 28! I cant say enough good things about them ! They are so friendly, personable, and professional ! We love our pictures !!!!! They are soooo good people keep telling me we must have paid a fortune!  But we didnt just used a awesome company!  IF you are looking to get married in vegas book them now!. Peking duck was surprisingly close to authentic. Endless bread. Delicious drink (I forgot what mine was called, but it included some tropical fruits & rum). A bit pricy, but what do you expect from Wolfgang Puck? :)  This lovely restaurant is in the Venetian and, if you're lucky, you can get seated "outside" and listen to Italian opera singers while you dine. 

Gets major brownie points for being located right across from Jimmy Choo & Burberry!. Yum!  My first dim-sum experience (so if you're a huge dim sum connoisseur take this review with a grain of salt.)  This place was recommended by a few different friends.  Service was quick and friendly.  I was prepared to be rushed and not know what anything was but they actually told us what everything on the cart was (it wasn't busy....and us gringos didn't understand everything but tried most of it anyway).  It's good to know for your first time that the most expensive cart comes out first...but that's where the good stuff if!  The crab and shrimp balls we got were yummy.  The wonton (? i think?  It looks like a haystack) wrapped shrimp ball was my fav!  I'd return again.. Henry Vilas Zoo spoiled me. Seriously, how can anyone complain against a FREE zoo!? It's amazing!

Sure, it's not the biggest place, but for its size, the place has a lot to offer! Penguins, bears, turtles, rhinos, lions, giraffes, and even the adorable red pandas!? Plus, kids have a giant playground to run around. 

Too, there's a beach and large grassy areas right around the place. 

I loved coming to the zoo on my off days when I lived in town, and it's one of the things I now miss the most. Take advantage of it! :). Busy strip location and it serves up what you're  (likely) looking for... BOOZE! 

Only, this particular location doesn't offer $1 shots. Pro tip: MGM, Planet Hollywood and Strat locations hook you up. 

The service here is good... not as social as the other locations, because they turn a lot of customers over, I imagine. 

They can also hook you up with mixed drinks - not just the slushies that you notice first when you walk in. Speaking of the slushies, there are definitely more sizes than the yard sized tubes that you see.

There's not really a place for sitting, but maybe one table. This location is really just for getting your yard long booze bottle and keeping it moving.. I was here to teach a tango class (upstairs on the Thursday evening), and the setup was great--

The sound system was good, the floor was good 'ole hardwood (but a little sticky), and the way the tables and chairs were set up made it great for a class. 

The classes ended up being about 40 people/class, so I had to change the facing to view the windows rather than the stage so that more people could see. 

I would definitely use this classroom again. At the end of class we got a bottle of bubbly. It was. Delicious!

They also brought up a bunch of glasses and water pitchers for everyone---they should have this at ALL tango classes!



**I didn't eat any food, but it seemed to be pretty busy and bustling downstairs!**. We came here with a bachelorette group and it was an amaZing experience! The food was FANTASTIC, the drinks were great and our server (Isabella) was the best!! She made it such a special and fun night for our group! Best sushi (and the seabass skewers! Don't even get me started... We had a moment) I've had!. 3 1/2 stars.  When I arrived at Bally's for our weekend stay, my expectations were loooooow.  But I was pleasantly surprised.

We were a group of 11, and we ended up getting a Grand Suite with an adjoining room.  The suites aren't that much bigger, they just have a big bathroom with a jacuzzi tub in the middle.  But seeing as we were a group of girls, not really worth the extra amount we paid for the suite.  And I think the regular hotel rooms are bigger than a lot of rooms that I've stayed in.

We were informed that if we tried to use the shower, it would cut our hand.  So a maintenance man came up to fix it, and he told us about his favorite places to go in Vegas... All strip clubs.

This place has prime location, and the pool was fun.  It didn't have the glamour of a Bellagio or a Caesars, but we were always able to get lounge chairs, and there were cocktail girls who brought us drinks.  

In the casino, don't miss the party pit.  It's a set of tables where they play top 40 music from a boombox, and they give you mardi gras beads and other prizes if you get a blackjack.  I thought it was amusing.  All in all, not the glitziest place you'll ever stay, but I would definitely come back to Bally's.. Decade is great! One of the best shops in the 'burgh. The owner, Steve, is super knowledgeable and friendly, and the clothes are really cute and hip (I got a really fun black dress last time I went in). The shop itself is a really cool space too, so it's always fun to go in and check out the new product. i have since moved from PA to CA, but I definitely plan on going back when I visit :). I didn't stay at the hotel so I can't comment on that, but I did come here for afternoon tea with my sister.

It's one of the pricier options for afternoon tea in Edinburgh but I'd say it's worth the price. The pastries, scones, and sandwiches were all delicious and my only vice is that the portions are too small. But that's to be expected of all afternoon tea spreads. And plus, let's be real, it's the Missoni. Everyone knows that people in fashion don't eat.

The atmosphere is trendy. If the name doesn't clue you in that Missoni operates this hotel, the decor certainly does.

I had really friendly and attentive service when I was here and was very happy. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone else interested.. Perfect Happy Hour for  the Happy Hour type of people.  Friendly,  honest staff members,  great prices,  cute snacks and large bar to accommodate solo visitors.  Randi is great!. Chris and his team were PHENOMENAL!! They stay in constant contact with you prior to your arrival, the day of and even after.  The first night we went out with a group of 8 ladies.  Everything was just as they said it would be.  Club and experience was awesome.  Second night we weren't sure were to go and when I reached out to Chris they gave us numerous suggestions.  Used them the second night as well with the same results.  This is a great service and I definitely recommend it to anyone going out in Vegas!!!  Well Done!. Stopped in here for some Asian Fusion fix. I actually like the concept, the food, the decor. I ordered the Korean BBQ burrito and my friend ordered the Asian tacos. I am definitely a fan of this establishment.. It was my first time here and I was pleasantly surprised. The food was really good (I had the 2 piece chicken meal), and those sweet rolls are just the icing on the cake !!! YUM!!!!! I will definitely be back to try other items.. I heard the three magic words within hours of arriving in Vegas - things moved really quickly: truffle, mac, cheese. 
eeeyah.  That was the extent of the action for me really, being in Vegas, the new destination for all things trade show. 
TJ's is what I call boring Vegas. It is clean. It is predictably expensive. Items are a la carte, a side of (ginormous) asparagus $12.

I didn't have it but the filet looked stupendous. Truffle mac - excuse me while I wipe the drool from my mouth just recalling that lovely serving of melted heaven. Mmmmmmmmmmmm.

Ask for the wop wop wine, have a few glasses of that and you'll soon forget you're in Vegas for work and actually start believing you're in a super hot Casino on the strip.

Service rocked.
What can I say the offerings in the Hilton at the Convention Center are fine. It's just not super Vegas, ya know?. I absolutely love Dr. Reuss!! He is the absolute best!! He has been my OB for the last three years and just delivered my son via C-section in November 2013. He was so caring through the whole process and really went above and beyond to make sure I was well taken care of at the hospital. On top of that, my scar looks great and is barely even noticeable. His staff is also great!! So happy he replaced Evette with Mary.  Mary is wonderful and is always so helpful when Dr. Ruess is unavailable! I now live an hour away from his office but continue to go there because of the quality of service provided!! That kind of service is hard to find these days!!. How do I describe this? The gal working the Kuma Snow Cream booth said it was a lighter texture than ice cream but a creamier texture than shaved ice.

This booth caught the BF's eye at the Life is Beautiful festival and I reluctantly followed him thinking that there wouldn't be anything for me. But such a good BF he is, he asks if they have vegan options and lo and behold, Vegan Watermelon with strawberry sauce! http://bit.ly/1vxFRxX

The texture is unlike anything that I've ever had and I really don't know how to describe it better than the gal mentioned in my first paragraph. But in my best effort, if ice cream and shaved ice had a fruity velvety baby, it would be this. I'm impressed and I'm a fan!. Best gym in Vegas. Zumba with Ginger and the new Insanity classes are my favorite. You also should visit Ashley for a great massage in the spa.. Best Carnitas, burritos or chimis. Fresh salsa, I always order a big cup to go!! Awesome, authentic mexican street food!!. Excellent little place!  Absolutely amazing amazing  food, which is wonderfully presented and fresh, not to mention affordable!  This is a newer place that needs a lot more recognition!  Family run; hospitality from owner is exceptional!. When my husband (then a boyfriend) and I were walking down rue st-paul est in vieux montreal, we spotted a group of Japanese people going into this restaurant.  Then my hubby went, "Hey J people went in there, they always know where it's at." lol  And he was right, they do know where it's at.

The best steak tartar!  The best oysters!  The wine selection... the flambee crepe, desert.... OMG everything we ate were ecstatic!  Since then, everytime we visit Montreal, we make a point to go to this restaurant.  I would say it's better than most of the restaurants I went to in Paris.  Just go there.  

Attire, business casual or above.  Very old school French, classy place, so I would suggest you be dressy.

*note: I went there before 2008 so the review is based on that.. I love this place! The food is amazing. I have eaten almost everything on their menu and never been disappointed. I even got my boss (who is hesitant to try new things) to try it and now he is hooked. It is very reasonably priced and the service is always great. The place is really clean and has a nice bright environment because they always have the windows open. I recommend this place to everyone.. Jackie & Husband and staff are amazing! They go well and beyond to make their customers happy, even if means staying late to fit into your busy schedule. They are always accommodating and will do whatever you need and Aldo do an amazing job! So lucky to find them! 



Suzy. Very nice rooms. Everything is decorated there as if you were at home, small kitchen but that's all you need, most likely you won't use it anyway. But they have a full size fridge, stove, microwave, toaster, ice trays, can opener, silverware cups plates paper towels, yes all of it. They also have a washer and dryer on site and a pool and jacuzzi pool. Definitely would come back. One of our cousins was in town visiting, so we decided to bring her to The Breadfruit and Rum Bar for cocktails and dinner.  This place exceeded our expectations.  The food is absolutely delicious.  This isn't a hole-in-the-wall type of ethnic places (although I do love those); this is a classy joint with fancy gorgeously-plated dinner items.  Portions are a little small, but the taste more than makes up for that.  I had the Brown Stew Chicken, which is less of a stew and more of melt-in-your-mouth chicken in brown sauce.  I also sampled the Jerk Chicken (great spices) and the Coconut Mackerel Rundown (like a tunafish on a chewy wonton - I've never tasted anything like it before, but it was delicious as weird as it sounds).  The cocktails were so well-crafted, with really subtle flavors that paired well with our meals.  The daily rum special (in a large punch bowl out front) was a guava-inspired drink so I was in heaven.  I also sampled the Mr. Smith (very strong and with great flavors again), the Shim Sham (light and fruity) and the Bourbon Masquerade (very aptly named- it tasted so much like bourbon).  The creativity and flavor of the cocktails were fantastic, and the place has a literal wall of rum to choose from when designing their drinks.  The prices are a little expensive, but it's definitely worth it for a special night.

The only thing holding me back from giving 5/5 stars was the service.  Our waitress was a little pushy, appearing visibly upset when we didn't order a "small plate" appetizer to go with our entrees and drinks, and she came off as cold and somewhat snobby overall.  Still, probably only one person, and maybe she was just having a bad night.

Overall, check this place out!  Great way to experience Jamaican food.. My husband and I live in the surprise area and we're looking for dinner.... We landed here and are pleasantly pleased. We order soft shell crabs, and 3 sushi rolls. Everything and I mean everything was fresh, flavorful and filling! Yummy! Love that surprise now has a sushi place that is worth my money!. This place was absolutely wonderful. Our waitress was amazing and I give her 5 stars! 

I finally found a place in Vegas that offers delicious Indian food. I had the lamb rogan josh and it was extremely spicy and extremely tasty. You can choose your level of heat. This is a must try !

Had a taste of other items on the menu and I loved them all. Definitely check this place out at least once. I know I'll be back.. It's been a couple years since we've eaten here and I'm not sure why it's been so long.  Everything here has always been wonderfull.  I'll do everything I can to make sure it doesn't take years to come back. Nice family atmosphere. Lots of seating. Good food!! Clean. If you love barbecue this is a must try!!. Considering it's a haul for my husband and I to get to this theater, we don't go too often.  In fact, we've only really been here for special events.

We saw a sneak preview of Quantum of Solace (yes, years ago), the final Harry Potter, and several midnight movies sponsored by Maximum Comics.  I can't really say much in terms of just a general night at the movies.

For the sneak previews, things can get really out of hand.  For Quantum of Solace there was just a mad dash for seats and lots of really irritated customers.  I think they've learned a little since then.  For Harry Potter, things were a bit more organized.  Certain groups of people got different colored wristbands.  Green would go in first, then red... you get the picture.  As much as this idea *should* have worked, there was still a lot of confusion.  Props for the effort though.

For the Maximum Comics midnight movies, they are great.  It's free to get in and the employees all treat us just as well as the paying customers.  Last night we went to another midnight movie ("Scrooged") but the film wasn't working.  So to make it up to us, the manager let us watch "The Sitter" for free.

The theater is huge and clean.  The seats are comfy.  Typical sky-high concession stand prices.  My only problem is that their popcorn never tastes very good. 

And be prepared for a long walk from the parking lot.. I had not been here in a long time. I knew there were new owners from reading the reviews. I am glad I returned. 
It is very clean looking when you walk in. All the tables had such crisp white clean linens it was refreshing. 
Our server was a very attentive young man and took the time to tell us the specials. 
I ordered the chicken sorrentino as the server recommended, after I asked him of the 3 entrees i was looking at, he stated the sorrentino was the best and described the dish and told me why he thought that. And he was right. It was so light and delicious. The chicken pounded down to the perfect thinness. I can not eat thick chicken breasts in such dishes as this. The eggplant was light and tasty and most important not laden down with grease. 
My favorite dinner companion, my son! had the gnocchi. He also enjoyed his dinner. 
We were not going to have dessert, but after the server described the desserts to us and told us they made them there we had to try one. 
We choose the cannoli, and they were heavenly. 
I am glad we went and had this amazing meal. I have been wondering where I could find another great Italian meal after Bona closed. 

My son and I were talking during our dinner and were saddened that we were the only patrons at this fantastic establishment. We are supporters of local restaurant's and do not want to see any more good ones have to close due to the economy. We have lost too many. 

Go, give this place a try, I believe you will not be disappointed.. I want to say thank you, I called this company & spoke to Bill, we had a problem at our property & he answered all my questions. Bill came out the same day, he told me step by step what needed to be done & how long it would take. Bill was prompt with a estimate, the job was done fast & very professional his crew was very professional as well. I can say we are very pleased with the job & crew!! I recommend this company to anyone. I never met a person as nice as Bill & I just want to say thank you to him & his crew if we need you again we will be calling!. My sister and I went here on a whim. I have driven by before and we took a chance at stopping by. What a great experience we had! I had my daughter with me and normally she sits with me while I get my nails done but this place actually had a child chair! So my little one got her nails done as well and they were great. My sisters and my nails turned our amazing and two weeks later my gel is still perfect. I would recommend anyone to try this place, I know I will be back!. Restaurant is always spotless outside and always leaves a bit to be desired on the patio. Food is excellent. It's obvious they use quality ingredients. For some items, portions are a little small for the price. For others, they're huge. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, though. Always cooked to order and always done quickly.. I recently visited Whole Foods for the first time in my life, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I was particularly shocked by the prices--not because they're worthy of the "Whole Paycheck" nickname, but because they're surprisingly low.  Perhaps the nickname was developed by people who'd previously only shopped at cheap-o supermarkets.

I like the well-stocked salad bar and dining area, and so does the rest of Pittsburgh, apparently.  Half the city was assembling salads during my last visit.  Vegan items are clearly marked as such, and everything is fresh.. I visited Spago for the first time early on a Friday evening and was treated like an old friend. 

The general manager, Michael Schwarz was very attentive and made sure that I was well taken care of. The place has a warm, friendly neighborhood vibe which is created and encouraged by the staff, which is amazing considering it is smack dab in the middle of Las Vegas.  Peter our bartender was delightful and the cocktails were the best I'd had in Vegas. 

If you are looking for a  fun place to chat over dinner and drinks, people watch, and not feel like you are deep in the Vegas scene, this is the best place to go.. 500th review!  Might as well be the hospital that brought my precious little baby into the world.  And I should probably write the review before I start duking it out with my health insurance company.  It always tries to get out of paying its share of the bills.

This hospital offers childcare and childbirth classes.  Both traditional and "alternative" childbirth classes. Not free but reasonably priced.  The classes my husband and I took were heavy on discussion, which was super helpful for me.  A lot of questions came up that I never thought to ask.  And in the child care class, they let us practice changing diapers, bathing and swaddling over and over on pretty accurate baby dolls (floppy and heavy).  My husband had never changed a diaper in his life, so this practice came in super handy when I was incapacitated after the birth.  Like Margret mentioned, the pre-registration process was super easy.  I got the paperwork at the free hospital tour, filled it out at home, and dropped it off.  They made copies of my insurance cards and I was good to go.

In terms of labor and delivery, there are good and bad aspects.  When I first checked in, I was put into triage which is a bunch of curtained beds.  There the nurses verified whether I was really ready to have the baby.  That took longer than I would have liked and we had to listen to other conversations about potential miscarriages that also came in for treatment.  They really should have a separate triage area for people who are having issues.  It's really awkward to hear people talking about such a sensitive subject and I'm sure the other patients didn't appreciate hearing about my perfectly healthy 39 week term baby on the way.

The delivery rooms and post partum rooms are private.  I seriously can't imagine how it would work any other way.  The delivery rooms are big, no windows, but really nice.  The post partum rooms are smaller but have a window. Each room, delivery or post partum, has its own restroom with shower stocked with basic toiletries (toothpaste, toothbrush, combo bathwash/shampoo).

In terms of my delivery, well, let's just say things don't always go as planned.  It was a rough recovery.  Most of the staff were extremely helpful, competent and nice.  However, with all things in life, there has to be a few crazies running around.  One nurse kept complaining to me that the rooms were not properly stocked.  Uh, I'm hooked up to an IV, I can't feel my legs, and yet I feel like a truck just hit me.  What the f*ck do you want me to do about it?!? Thankfully the nurses changed at least every 12 hours.  The most annoying thing was that the nurses all had very different advice about child care.  Very confusing for a first time, sleep-deprived mom.  I know opinions differ, but it would be great if they all had a pow wow and developed a party line on certain crucial issues.

And a Yelp review would not be complete if I didn't critique the food.  Some of it was pretty crappy.  Do NOT get the cheeseburger.  And the fries were awful as well.  The low-sodium tomato soup was super sweet - yuck.  But the chicken tenders were tasty (ask for extra ranch dressing) and I had a special farfelle with meatballs which was pretty good. There was a Nutrition Room in post partum where patients and their significant others can help themselves to pudding, jello, sandwiches, popsicles, etc.  Most of the food in the Nutrition Room was super sweet, surprisingly enough. But food on demand is available.

I can't give it five stars, but it was a pretty good experience for me under the circumstances.. Finally a pizza I reeeaaaalllly enjoy! This is the first review I've ever written. I just moved here a few months ago and I've tried quite a few 
Pizza places and I'm happy to say it was delicious. Just the right amount of sauce, cheese and toppings. The crust is not too thick and not too thin. Oops, almost forgot to mention the mild wings were delicious also!. It's Sunday morning and it's feeding time! I asked Hunnie Bunnie if she wanted to go out to eat this morning and she asked if we could come here! My good little Vegan! Of course I said Yes, I've Been wanting to try this place out as well. 

They have indoor and "outdoor" seating and they sell vegan products within as well.

We were seated at a booth and ordered:

Mexi Burger: Veggie patty w/roasted pasilla peppers, melted Daiya cheese, and slaw. (Also added the roasted jalapenos!) Side of Pico de gallo and guacamole. Side of spicy sweet potato fries, included. 

Classic grilled cheese sandwich w/potato salad, included: blend of Daiya cheeses. 

Hunnie Bunnie loved her potato salad and the grilled cheese was nice and cheesey for her! Thumbs up for sure! 

My burger was delicious as well! I cut it in half and tried to eat it with my hands but ended up eating with a fork and knife. It was a bit messy but tastey so who cares! And the roasted jalapeños added a nice kick to it. 

We both agree that fake "meat" isn't really the business and they have great options here that don't include soy "chicken" and whatever else... Lots of fresh ingredients. All raw options and cooked items on the menu.
We will definitely come here again! NOM NOM!. 4 star food. 3 star service. 

Found this place on Yelp and went to try it a few days back.  Small place, weird parking, nice decor. 

Our server was very friendly and at the beginning everything seemed OK. We got chips and salsa, she took our order, brought our appetizer and then our meals. It seemed the food was prepared fast. Then she went to get me a drink refill and never came back. We tried hard to get her attention but nothing. 

About the food:
Not so crazy about the chips but the salsa was very tasty. Warm salsa felt funny at the beginning but we ended up liking it. 
Queso fundido was really good, came with 4 floor tortillas that were small and thin which translates to less carbs. 
I found their menu keto friendly and we liked the food, just the meat was not very tender.. Had a great dinner here. The Portuguese corn bread was delicious   The salmon with beet sauce was perfect. We enjoyed our dinner here- cozy and welcoming  atmosphere.  Don't forget dessert we had bread pudding and cookies and cream. We went on Valentines weekend so the price was higher than usual. Also like Byob although they charged 5 dollar corkage fee it is worth it to bring your own choice of wine. There is also fee for sharing plate but again worth it.   Will definitely go again.. It was good. Yummy yummy sushi, they have a wide variety of rolls to choose from. Their ayce price is reasonable, and there's also quite a wide selection of appetizers to choose from. The service for us was quick. All the food came out in a matter of minutes from ordering. Would recommend for anyone looking for a sushi fix!. Thank you Andy and Adrian for your excellent services today. Was not able to take my dog to a groomer but he had an accident in his crate. These guys came out the same day and did a great job! My dog is big and hyper but Adrian was able to handle him. My puppy came back smelling fresh and he took well to the groomer. All in all was a good experience for my first time with a mobile groomer.. I love our stay at the Monte Carlo. We had Spa suit ($90) sweet. Room was big with bar, sofas, comfy bad and nice jacuzzi next to the window with the strip view.Awesome.
Cleaning service was very good.
Definitely I will stay again.. I was here last night after the bars closed in Old Town. I was thrilled to know there's a place to grab food late besides typical fast food and Philadelphia Sandwich is open 24 hours!. 

This place is yummy. I had a cheesesteak with onion rings and it was really good (and I wasn't drunk so my tastebuds were operating under fairly normal conditions). 

There were a ton of people milling inside so I figured it would take some time to get my food--nope, I waited maybe 5 minutes.

The food itself was great, I doubt you'd be disappointed with anything on the menu. It all looked good.  I'll go back next time I'm in Old Town and craving a cheesesteak. The onion rings were okay--I'd still order them again but Corleones has THE BEST onion rings in my opinion so there's some tough competition. Hmmm...there is just something about the way cheeseteaks and onion rings go together. 

Oh, and I'm not sure if they do this all the time but they had a DJ playing awesome music SUPER loud. I felt bad for the people sleeping in the surrounding hotels but it was fun for us in the restaurant.  Everyone was dancing in the middle of the restaurant so that was an added bonus.. I have had to have a ring fixed that we bought from them a couple of times because the stone fell out. I wish they would communicate better when they say it will one day to fix but it ends up taking three days with no call to update me between. They are always very nice and have good customer service otherwise.. I love this quaint little library. The children and baby story times are fun and well done! The children's section has an amazing assortment of books and a cute play area that has some innovative activities for little ones to do while their parents gather books nearby. There isn't much to complain about here! I love coming.. Bottle service is key in Vegas.

If it's your first time going to Sin City, don't think that your player duds or feminine wiles are enough to gain you even just an inch of sitting butt room at many of the big clubs.

Cause they won't.

We made our way here on our second night in Vegas. Our feet were tired and aching from standing in line, just to get in, so we scanned the bumpin' room immediately for a place to sit. 

No such luck.

We tried to bust out our most impressive moves, hoping they'd help score us some room at at table, but all I got was blank stares, and since the sore balls of my feet, were not cooperating, I went outside.

On a warm night, Ghost Bar is outstanding. Their outdoor elevated patio will provide a glimpse of the city which is well worth any wait. On this particular night, however, it was windy and cold -  so me, Connie, some sucking face couple, and a friendly bouncer were some of the only people daring enough to brave the weather.  But I needed a place to take off my boots, and outside was the only place with available chairs.

And so I busted out my final most beautiful move at Ghost Bar thus far - the ole' "get these suckers off my feet NOW!" move, let the wind daggers of the night - wrangle my hair into some lovely knots, and then finally went inside to scope out the scene once more.

Unlike Tao - there was room to move, but it had been a long night, and eager to rest our feet - we made like ghosts and disappeared.

(we eventually found our way to Rain - where shoes were removed and full blown dance moves were unleashed on Vegas. And trust. Those were some happening moves.). Simply delicious! Super fresh! Clean! Nice space! Great music selection! Well stocked little Bar! The best part, aside from the really delicious food, was Pia, our server. Here 1 month from Thailand.. Excellent service!!! She only works Fri, Sat Sun. My daughter fell in love with her and the food!! Great new place to add to our weekly line-up! I used a lot of exclamations because it made us feel happy! And we could all use a little more happy in our lives! Thanks SaBai! See you soon!. Quaint little coffee shop. Plenty of tables and space. Its the perfect coffee shop if you want to catch up on some work while enjoying a great cup of coffee. 

  I had the americano, which was excellent. They also serve bagel sandwiches (SO YUM) as well as a number of grilled cheeses. 

  Don't forget to pick up one a cookie while you're there, they're the infamous chocolate chip cookies from Cafe Neve !. Stopped in here again for more ejuice and wanted to try some new flavors & couldn't be happier! The staff are always very helpful and have great recommendations. I got Dream which is a pink starburst flavor, Watermelon & a Butterscotch custard flavor. They're great flavors! Also if you sign up for the rewards points it's even better. I just hit $8 off my next purchase! :). Fantastic chicken tortilla soup! Very fresh ingredients, white chicken meat, fresh not tomatoey broth, tiny tortilla strips and no cheese! Perfect!. Absolutely wonderful massage. Highly recommend getting a massage here. Brittiney was fabulous!. Dave and Vince are fabulous. They installed our new unit fast, were friendly and  .  Professional, and hauled our old unit away. They ensured to clean up after themselves They let us know the best time to buy and helped us get the best deal. 
Vince and Dave walked us through how to run the unit and what best filter to use.  They told us how to maintain efficiency.  
Highly recommended. I love Juans!  I have been coming here for about 10 years and the food is definitely authentic!  I have always had great service and most of the time is is pretty quick.  I have found the owner, Juan, to be very friendly.  The salsa is great and I haven't had anything I don't like here.  Their refried beans are fantastic and my favorite is their green chile!

I highly recommend Juans!. When I got of work today my mother in law asked me to take a look at her cat as I am a veterinary technician. After taking a look at her I saw that she needed immediate care. I called 2 vca hospitals one turned me down the other said to come in but once I got there they turned me away so I decided to go to emergency. I called them to tell them we were on the way and what was going on and the receptionist said that they had other critical patients there but they would see her as soon as we got there. As soon as I walked in the door the technician came right out and took our cat to put on oxygen as she was having trouble breathing and said they would be back out shortly to get a history from us. The receptionist was very nice and have us the necessary paper work to fill out and the technician came back out to get the information from us. Everybody was very nice and professional and took the time to answer my 4 year olds questions even though they were very busy. After awhile they took us in a room and the doctor came in and explained what she found on exam and told us we needed to do further testing to see if we could figure out what was going on. She was very understanding and compassionate about the whole situation and even took the time to explain to my daughter that a blood draw was not killing the kitty. I am giving them 4 stars because it would have been nice to get the information a little quicker but everybody was very helpful and when it came time to make the decision to put our girl to sleep they were all awesome and gave us the time we needed. For an emergency hospital I believe the prices were very fair and if I ever need to use these type of services again I will not hesitate to go back here.. Dim sum is served hot and tasty and the carts just keep coming and the women are assertive and try to get you to order the dishes off the cart!  Must better experience this time around. Yes!  This place nailed it for perfect cupcakes.  Not too sugary, smooth and sweet.  Moist, fresh, flavorful in the cake and in the frosting, while not overpowering.  The cake and the frosting are made to complement, not to be the same.  These folks understand how it works; that's why they can make anything you want.. [T]asty doesn't even begin to describe this dish!
[O]nce you try it, you'll get the hype-
[M]any reviews cite it as the reason they come here...

[Y]ou will too once you try it!
[U]ntil now, I never knew the  flavors of this soup; 
[M]y taste buds still did a happy dance, regardless.

[G]o now and grab an 
[O]rder, it's
[O]verflowing with seafood 
['N'] it packs a punch of 
[G]ood and balanced flavors.

[F]inally, a dish I can
[R]egularly order when
[I]'m overwhelmed by Chinatown options.
[E]ven though I love trying new things,
[D]efinitely going to get this dish, here,

[R]egularly.
[I]
[C]an only hope that you
[E]njoy this dish as much as I do.. This place is one of the best sushi spots in Vegas!!!  When this place is packed or just has a few people scattered through the restaurant, the service is always the same......efficient and  amazing!  I've never had to wait more than a minute before someone comes up to greet me which is a rare thing these days.  The sushi rolls are unique, beautiful, and all have such diverse tastes.   When I have gone there by myself the sushi chefs are great at making you feel welcome and are very interactive, they are the same when I have gone with someone as well but are great for the lone ranger who's out looking for a great dining experience. I highly recommend this place for any local or if you are visiting, it will become you new fav sushi spot or at least be added to your list for sure!  LOVE ME SOME KAIZEN!  Keep up the great work you guys!. We go to the gas station to get the mini carne asada tacos. The best street tacos around the southwest!. What a fun adventure ! Today we went out the gorgeous Cave Creek recreation area  and rode horses with the Cowboys..This has to be one of the best experiences of horseback riding I have had. The horses were healthy and energetic, the trails was breathtaking, the crew very helpful. 
The horse back operation is ran for the "winter " season by Jeff and Debbie who have this down to a science.  They have boots, hats and props for all ages . They even throw in a bottle of water for you if needed. 
Here are the extras I like :
Ran  the groups in small bunches  about  4 to 8 toy a group. 
Have saddlebags for your camera, water bottles and what not.
Very personable bunch  friendly  without being fake
Hats  provided  --nice touch on a sunny day
Trails are interesting and you feel like you are out of the city
Clean neat operation
gave us a 5.00 buck off person coupon for next time for our whole group --- gotta have coups , baby! 

If you have family visiting  in town this is a great AZ experience , you can swing by Cave Creek when you are done and have BBQ at Bryans..  hurry thought the winter season ends May1 st... We saw this show at The Trop for free, because my husband's step-dad worked there for many years.

That said, this was a good family-friendly show using tigers (such beautiful animals). Yeah, sometimes the cheesy lines were a bit much, but the illusions offset that. It was entertaining and he did incorporate some kids from the audience into his show, which was nice.. Great food! Great prices! Mmmm!. Such a cute, CLEAN, comfortable place.... I was in desperate need of a fill and was so pleased with finding this gem! It's in the perfect location in old town Scottsdale... Highly recommend, thumbs up!. Take any lounge/club but make it during the daytime + outside at a nice pool + there you have Tao Beach. And, of course, true to any clubbing-like experience, your perceptions of how good your time was is dependent on 
       A) how hot/fun/young the crowd is that day
            + 
       B) how much you drink
Our group of all girls came on a Sunday early afternoon + pretty much had a good time considering the crowd was young + good-looking + we each had at least a few drinks in our system. If you're looking for a place to just lay out + relax, Tao Beach isn't for you. You can go to a regular hotel pool for that. This is one of the many hotspots to get the party started before night falls.

* Location - Before heading to the pool, the line starts downstairs where you have to get hand-stamped on the ground floor by the Coffee Bean. I don't know if this is how they always do it, but it's pretty smart to have this first bouncer indoors considering the heat. Once stamped on the wrist http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qEJjv2k8nDhOiYpmi_aVOw?select=iAkuMc24VMqSvK2cT2_2nA, the Venetian pools are up on the 4th floor where you'll pass through the regular pool before seeing the line + hearing the bumping music for Tao Beach. Here's another line where you get your wristband + a complimentary towel.   

* Parking - Venetian self-park, walk over, or take a taxi.

* Venue - Yea, it's pretty small... Most of the action happens at a shallow pool at the far end where party-goers dance + mingle in the cloudy waters http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qEJjv2k8nDhOiYpmi_aVOw?select=Mfs0mR6_guMJ0b8IFXgD2Q then there's a middle section of daybeds + umbrellas before the bar + some tables at the other end. The whole area is surrounded by tables + colorful cabanas that you can reserve for a pretty penny. Unless all the tables aren't reserved or you know people (or can get to know people, haha) who have tables, there isn't much space to tan or leave your things. There's another really small jacuzzi-sized pool by the bar, but it's in an awkward place so no one really goes in there.

* Cleanliness - Like any pool, it's not going to be clean after a only couple hours. Considering that there's hundreds of people dancing, splashing + doing their thing in there all day... mmm yea, murky waters. However, there's staff around that monitors that no one's drinking in the pool. The guy blows a whistle + points so everyone pretty much stares down the wrong-doer until he/she gets out. The pool deck area is fine. It can get pretty slippery when wet, though, if you're walking or dancing around barefoot. 

* Crowd - It takes a certain kind of person to come to a pool party... one who isn't shy to strip down to a bikini/swim shorts + is down to get their drink on in broad daylight to loud bumping music. Tao Beach is for the young + good-looking... plus the many who wish they were or have the guts to come. Seeing a 40-something year old guy doing a gyrating solo performance on the side of the pool + flashing a thong under his shorts was an interesting spectacle, haha. Other than that, expect the people here to be slightly on the younger side of the 21+ crowd.  

* Music - Top hip hop hits plus some EDM mixed in here + there. I'm pretty sure the DJ played some repeats during the 3-4 hours we there, but whatever. It's the kind of beats that has everyone up + dancing in the pool or having a good time on the deck or by the bar. 

* Bar - There's a few small tables to sit at, but it's mostly just a small bar at the end specializing in frozen drinks + whatever else you'd want to keep you cool in the Vegas heat. There's another bar closer to the pool as well. I honestly didn't spend too much time at the bar but when I did drink... I wasn't the one buying, haha. Bartenders are hot chicks. 

* Drinks - As mentioned, they specialize in frozen drinks + have some of their red-bikini waitresses going around with shots. Prices are high... in the range of $10+ for most everything, but then again it is Vegas...

* Bathroom - It's very inconveniently located all the way back by the entrance to the whole pool area. Sure it's a decent size, but considering how many people are not only at Tao Beach but also the general Venetian pool... yea. Go before you enter if you can.  

* Price - Like pretty much every other group of girls, we got in free. It being a summer weekend, guys have to pay... but the amount is anything from $20 + up depending on how many guys + how crowded the space is. If you're a guy, I recommending either staying at Venetian or Palazzo to get in free or coming early with a group of girls to help your chances of not having to wait forevermore or pay more.    

* Misc - The day we went happened to be Pamela Anderson's birthday http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qEJjv2k8nDhOiYpmi_aVOw?select=GgsOJyOXaAlwlYWGBtrUtw so she made a 30-second appearance at the DJ booth before disappearing back into the private cabanas. Too bad I didn't manage to snap a picture of her.... I had a full set and eyebrow wax on 12/15.  Today is 1/10 and there are no loose nails, no chipped polish, not one nail popped off; just need a fill and that's it.  I got exactly what I asked for and have had many compliments on my nails for a very reasonable cost.   There is a bit of a wait but once you are seated, the tech is quick and efficient.. I've seen a few Cirque du Soleil shows, and KA is by far the best one.  It is AMAZING!   Never a dull moment, very exciting, action packed.  The stage is incredible.  It is a MUST SEE!. I've got girlfriends in town and I need to show them a good time! We get set up for a comp dinner at Stack on Saturday night. The table is set for the six of us in the lounge area near the bar overlooking the casino. 
I was actually warned that the comp dinner here wasn't very good and that they were stingy with the food. WRONG. We had A LOT of food and unlimited well drinks and a special delicious shot made by the bartender. We had pigs in a blanket, roasted chicken, french fries, veggies, buffalo wings, Caesar salad, and this raw beef you cook on a hot stone. Everything was REALLY good, our server was awesome and most importantly my girls had an awesome evening!. We went here at an odd time (3-ish) and we were greeted with a smile. Every dish we tried was delicious. Garlic chicken, pepper steak, Szechwan chicken, and beef curry were all distinctly different and excellent. The curry is authentically spicy and full of flavorful ginger, basil, and lemongrass. This place is a treasure.. First off - so happy there's an Indian restaurant on Monona Drive now. 

Second, the owner is SUPER nice. He and the staff are so friendly every time we're in there. And he was telling us how they make it a point not to use food dyes like other places do in dishes like vindaloo, which tend to dyed red. Always a plus.

The food is delicious - veg curry, fish vindaloo, saag paneer all really tasty. I love the saffron/red color scheme, too, which is a little different than most Indian places.. I went to Cathy a few times for waxing (underarms and Brazilian) and she was fantastic. She was very friendly and made me feel very comfortable. I would definitely recommend her to anyone who needs a waxing lady. Thanks again Cathy!!. Fantastic sandwich. Juicy, little spicy very good value. Both the chicken and beef rock. Beats any Italian beef I've ever had.. I was stuck on a rainy day on my way to work with a screw in the front tire of my MINI.  These guys were nice and polite.  They fixed my car quickly.  The place is clean and comfortable.  Great service.. Location: Little Italy, on the Main. You've probably walked be in a hundred times without even noticing this place, unless of course, you happened to be walking by while they were baking. Then the smell probably pulled you in. 

The place: Small, nothing fancy. 

The goods: I stopped by to pick up some strawberry Cronettos to accompany my Olimpico coffee early Saturday morning. I'm generally not a fan of donuts and neither is my date, however we both got great enjoyment out of those Cronettos, let me tell you. I was worried they would be sickeningly sweet but was pleasantly surprised, as this wasn't the case. The strawberry cream was super light and while there was a little too much brown sugar (?) on the doughnut (it ended up in my lap of course), I didn't find this pastry to be heavy at all. Great flavor, though a little messy to eat! Make sure you've got some napkins!

Service: OK.

Price point: Honestly, at $4 a pop, they're expensive. I think a more reasonable cost would be $2 each.. Finally got around to trying the Lunasagna...it is good and comes with a really nice salad.  Other things I have tried on recent visits include the Kale Lemonade and Gateway To Green. 

So far, everything has been really good.  The Rawco Taco Salad is still my favorite entree but on my next visit, I really need to branch out &  try something else. 

I feel so healthy everytime I eat here...I really wish we had a place like this out in Ballantyne!. Located in the heart of uptown Charlotte, the Blumenthal Center is an amazing venue that host the best entertainment Charlotte has to offer. After stalking tickets for Motown the Musical, I finally discovered that you can get a ticket with a student ID starting 2 hours before the show for $25. There was no line to purchase tickets, as the show was nearly sold out. The ticket guys were friendly and I was fortunate to get what I felt was the best seat in the house, Grand Tier center (F 311 to be exact).

When I returned later for the show, the ushers, who are primarily comprised of senior citizens.... not sure how that happens.... were very kind and helpful. The visuals and acoustics of the show were amazing. The great thing about the Blumenthal is that there is NO bad seat in the house. No matter where you are sitting, you will be able to see and hear. It is very well designed.

I think you can often judge a venue by its restrooms. During intermission, the line was SO Long. However, there were ushers in the restroom, which had 48 stalls. Having people direct patrons to stalls was immensely helpful and the line moved very swiftly. While there is an individual unisex restroom upstairs, the better option is to get in the longer line downstairs. Overall, a great place and I highly recommend you see any show there, as all I've attended have been nothing shy of fantastic.. Been here once. I took in my feather-down comforter to get cleaned. I had a first time customer coupon for 25% off. Reasonably priced for organic products. Got the comforter back in a clear plastic bag and another coupon for next visit. Overall, great. They got the stains I had out of my comforter and not only does it looks cleaner, but a lot fluffier as well!. We stayed here this weekend. Our room was amazing and overlooked the Ballagio fountains. Guest services, the doormen and housekeeping were incredible. We really enjoyed ourselves. The only downside was that the bartender at the sports bar on level one made our Bloody Mary's pretty weak, when you are paying $16 for a drink it should be a drink to remember. Otherwise - best trip ever!. From the phone call to book to walking out the door .... FANTASTIC.  
BEST facial EVER.  Got my brows waxed as well and never had so much time spent on time.  She was a perfectionist.  Then pedicure.  Liz is AMAZING.  LOVE HER.  
Will be back .... for sure.. I like the selection of stuff here, it's kind of funky. It's in step with their proximity to the Sundance Theater. Baggalini purses and some cool umbrellas stand out in my mind. I thought the people working here were very friendly. They tested some batteries for me and lent me a tool to adjust something on my car. The prices seemed to be the same as some things I've seen at BB&B. They close at 5pm on Sat & Sun, which you have to plan for.... I always come here when I go to Vegas. AMAZING sushi for a decent price. I highly suggest doing the all you can eat option since it's such a great deal. The only downside is that the wait for a table is loooong especially during dinner time. I've waited nearly an hour on a couple of occasions. Other than that, everything is great.. this place is awesome. they have excellent combo meals esp for lunch the prices are ridiculously low! great value. the food is very yummy and they give generous portions for great prices. love this place.. After having great shakes and burgers here, you can wander the community gardens at Agritopia! The only things holding me back from giving five stars are the long lines and lack of substantial indoor seating. Be prepared to wait a half hour and eat your food outside.. Everything we had was amazing!!! Soo delicious, could eat here every night of this trip but would hate myself for not exploring more!. The rub I received was very thorough. Hit almost every rough spot in my body. 

Choose the 30min reflex/30 min head back shoulders for only $30.

I went with my better half.  The clock started ticking down as soon as they started on him, instead of each of us separate. My massause came in the shop about 15 minutes after they started on my husband so I was already a bit upset.

I usually silence my phone when I go into massage and spa places...my massause got two calls while working on me! And didnt seem hurried or embarrased about it, kept working on me while talking with a full loud voice on the phone.  Hard to relax at this point! 

To top it off, his fingers smelled of cigarette smoke. Lets just say I was holding my breath while he worked the head and neck. Not relaxing !

Would probably return, but would definitely ask for another massause and demand a full 60 minutes.. Never been in any Filibertos before so this was my first time experience. I ordered the rolled tacos and the Horchata. It was delicious. From the beans, rice, tacos, salsa and Horchata. Everything tasted great. I'll be back. Thanks.. I really really really enjoyed this buffet!!! I will definitely come back. It was a bit pricey but worth it. Very fancy shmancy. Everything I tried was really good. I wish I didn't get full so fast so I could have tried everything though! Can't wait to go back.. I went back and got my butt kicked with their Iced Coffee with Sea Salt Creme. After making my drank.. Sou recognized me from my previous visit and said.. Oh hi! You're having coffee this late?! It's really strong. I told him I'm going shopping, soooooo I needed my second gust of wind. He said ooooookay and reminded me how to mix my drink with the sea salt creme. I mastered the mixing motion down and was proud to show him my twirl. See.. see.. 

Thinking I could handle this drink, I, fearlessly gulped half of it down before leaving the lot. It was that good. I'm not much of a heavy coffee drinker, but the bitterness out shined the sea salt creme.. ending with hints of caramel. There was a pleasant balance between the strong coffee flavor and the sweetness of the creme. 

Silly me was bold to ask for a large size! I felt my veins being fueled with caffeine as I drank away. I should've listened to Sou. I felt like I took one of those dangerous fat burner pills way back in the days. It gave me this jolt.. so extreme that my heart couldn't even keep up with its beat. My eyes were wide open. I was spasming out. 

I tried to calm my loony self by going to a bookstore, but my eyes were in a frenzy, they couldn't keep still in reading a page! After it was all absorbed and done.. I felt eminently exhausted. Holy caffeine high!!! I'll never do that again :P 

So be forewarned.. this Iced Coffee will kick your a**. Deliciously!. Beautiful hotel room and pool. Everything is incredibly modern.  The spa was beautiful.  The only reason I have deducted a star is because it is a bit pricey.   But I'd still go back.. I love this two-level indoor mall. It has every store I need and is just so beautiful. For the holidays, the mall gets extravagantly decorated with wreaths and holiday trees galore! The mall itself is super clean and offers a food court, Harkin's theatre, and various restaurants within the proximity (Cheesecake Factory, Kona Grill...) and off the proximity but still within the same area. I suggest parking in front of Macy's; generally, there is always parking there unless something crazy is happening (Black Friday, anyone?). 

I love this mall. That's just it, really.. I signed up for the free class which I enjoyed so much that I signed up for the unlimited class for new clients that same day. It was $100 for 1 month. After only a few classes, I noticed I sat up straighter at my desk at work and correcting my posture when I found myself slouching. After almost a month, I see definition in my arms, legs and abs. I feel stronger. The routine is different each class so you don't get bored. 

The instructors and staff are all very welcoming and friendly. oh and they offer babysitting too!. Finally made it over to Karben4 for sunday brunch and it was worth the drive!

Everything on the small menu sounds amazing and everything me or my companions ordered rocked.

I got the Monte Cristo, which was fabulous. The French Toast was perfect and the ham was good quality. The egg was a perfect amount of runny. 

They offer a combination platter (can't remember the name) that also comes in a half sized version, the Tiny Tim. Don't be fooled by "half sized" - it comes with so much food and is a steal! You get the pulled pork sandwich, ham, greens and French toast with a fruit compote. It's about the same price as if you just ordered the pulled pork sandwich (very good, by the way) by itself! 

Friends ordered their special mimosa, which is juice mixed with their IPA. Not a fan of IPAs myself but my pals really enjoyed this.. LOVE! Great staff, cool vibe, good lookin cats and probably had the best Vegas DJ spinnin the night I went. DJ Casanova! 

We had a table on the rooftop and were taken care of very well. Security guards were very nice and the waitress was cute. I'll be coming back here every time I come to Vegas :). This little gem hidden away in the Golden Gate Casino is worth the walk and sketchy "Downtown" parking situation. The food and atmosphere are family-friendly, as long as you're willing to walk the kiddos through a bit of the Casino.  They specialize in comfort food, and it's always good eating at Dupar's!  

Having their buttery, sinful pancakes should be on everyone's bucket list.  You haven't tried pancakes until you've tried them at Dupar's!  All their food is prepared fresh with quality ingredients and it shows.  No pre-cooked bacon or egg beaters like IHOP.  This is the real deal.  

I order the country-fried chicken breast which comes with mashed potatoes and gravy and vegetables.  It's delicious!  The crust on the chicken is perfectly crunchy, and the mashed potatoes are not overseasoned.  The vegetables, surprisingly, are stellar and cooked to be tender, but still maintain the firmness and integrity of carrots, zucchini, etc.

The prices are downright cheap for a Casino restaurant and they have daily specials too.  Service is hit or miss, but when the food and price is right, I always come back!. It was my first time here, and it was fantastic! My aunt and I were debating on what to have and decided to split a scramble and French toast. The waiter was amazing and informed us we could have two different French toasts as one order. We had the OMG and the Neat. Both were absolutely wonderful. In the scramble we had mushrooms, bacon and cheddar. The bacon was good quality, thick cut and the veggies were fresh. All of the food was great but the service really got me hooked. The waiter was so helpful and friendly. We told him we were splitting and he thoughtfully split it all. So sad that I'm from out of town and not able to enjoy this great breakfast joint!. Love the product! Extremely hard workers! Very impressed! They helped with everything including color scheme, Hoa requests, large door frames, etc. Show room is cool too!. Sienna Mercato's Il Tetto is Open: Let's Shout It From the Rooftop!

I am infatuated with delicious eats, but I'm a sucker for ambience.  Find me a place that has both, and I will be your number one customer.  I'm excited to say that the visionaries behind Sienna Mercato are now two for two with the recent opening of Il Tetto.  Now you have the mother of all dilemmas.  Will you get your meatball on at Emporio (located on the first floor) before or after you take the elevator ride to Il Tetto's gorgeous rooftop beer garden? 

As some of you know I've been anticipating the opening of Il Tetto for some time.  As the cosmos would have it, their second night in operation just happened to be my birthday.  No lie, I was a tad nervous bringing my band of friends to a locale I had never been before, but the idea of a spacious rooftop bar in downtown was just too darn tempting to pass up.  My imagination had nothing on this place.  Upon exiting the elevator, my jaw dropped a bit.  The rain had stayed at bay, allowing the retractable glass ceiling to reveal a portion of the city's skyline and a pleasant nighttime breeze.  Seating options varied from cozy nooks to sizable party tables.  The bar, which lined an entire stretch of wall, was inviting as well.  No matter where you sit, be sure to look up and admire the gas lamps and charming strings of lights.  The décor is pleasing to most anyone I'd wager, from sports fans (there were several TVs playing the Buccos game) to those seeking a romantic rendezvous and anyone in between. 

 So, Il Tetto is picturesque, you get it.  But looks will only get you so far (as my grandma loved to remind me when I'd get "gussied up.")  I needed to get my hands on a birthday libation.  Lucky for me, the draft list is equally as impressive as Emporio's.  The reason?  Each of the 32 drafts that are downstairs are piped up to Il Tetto's bar.  You can also imbibe on wine and specialty cocktails if you prefer. 

In regards to food, the menu provides a select list of small plates ranging from munchies like house-made Pork Rinds to heavier dishes like the Duck Confit Steak Fries.  We ordered the latter.  The fries were crisp, yet tender and the duck fat gravy added a velvety richness to the plentiful shreds of duck meat.  The topping of a sunny side-up egg added yet another level of richness and texture.  In other words, it was...

http://fork2mouth.blogspot.com/2014/05/sienna-mercatos-il-tetto-is-open-lets.html. Although I felt the employees could've been a little more personable, you don't spend more than 5 mins with them anyway. Spumoni ice cream is my absolute favorite, but this was Spumoni gelato! Yummy :) my son had the strawberry gelato, it was a little too sweet in my opinion.. After all the negative reviews, I was honestly kind of dreading going when my friends asked us out to dine there.  Cafe Luna changed my mind that night.  Now, honestly, I'd been to them back when they were on campus and thought it was homier and the food was actually a bit better, but we still had a really nice night at the new location and a really good meal.  Important note, they have entrees of course, but you can get by easily on their tasty tapas menu.
Here's what we had:
Mushroom and something crostini - the crostini was a little crispier than I would have preferred and it was quite salty, but my husband ate all of his and he hates mushrooms.
Walnut crusted goat cheese balls - WOW were these good.  The cheese was gooey and the bread perfect.  It was drizzled with just a smidge of honey that combined perfectly with it and everything oozed and spread over the bread.  YUM
Flank steak over potatoes - very tasty.  The meat was very tender and flavored well and the potatoes were done in just enough oil to be cooked well but not greasy.
Potato gnocchi - I didn't think I'd like this as I've only really had gnocchi's that are sooo filling.  These were nice and light, very tender and in a nicely seasoned white sauce.
Duck confit ravioli - these were so rich.  Probably one of my lesser yums of the night.  They were just a little too sweet, but I couldn't pinpoint what the taste I wasn't enjoying was coming from.  They were still ok.  
The crab cakes were good, but a little on the seafoody side (you know, just a whiff of that clam chowdery smell)  Plus, my personal preference for crab cakes is that I love them really crunchy and deep-fried-y.  They were not mushy, but not crisp.  The sauce they were served with really came to the rescue.  I could have just eaten a bowl of that sauce.  
Coconut shrimp - freaking awesome - not much more to say than "wow!"
The prosciutto crostini was good.  One of the guys traded his portion of another appetizer to obtain his wife's crostini...it wasn't THAT good :)  

We also had salads.  I hate beets so I avoided the special salad of the night even thought they graciously offered to not add beets.  I instead had the house herb dressing salad.  The dressing was great, but the local greens were just a bit too...earthy.  Like sometimes the base of the leaves tasted a little dirty, which I shouldn't complain about, because that's what it tastes like coming out of my garden too.  I think I'm mad about this because I was insanely jealous of my husbands salad, which involved an entire half of a pear, roasted with goat cheese and walnuts.  OOO it looked so good and he didn't even give me a bite! :)  Next time, I'll know what to get.

On to service...OK, so I've had some weird experiences there I guess.  This time that we went with our friends, the staff was amazing.  Friendly, and I don't mean the hassling you every 2 minutes and squatting down to take your order type of friendly.  Just genuinely nice and trying to be as helpful as possible, including knowing when to buzz off without being asked to.  The weird part is, I had been in twice before on seperate occasions to see about just getting a table on some random days.  Both times I entered the dining room and got looked at like I was some moron, why was I there?  I don't know what the deal was, but maybe those were the people that were garnering all those bad reviews and maybe they've all been fired because when we went this last time...wow,  excellent.  Enjoy.  I hope they stay consistent and I don't have to eat my words with a new review next time I go.  

Summary:  service is better now, order the roasted pear salad and my 2 favorite tapas are walnut/goat cheese balls and coconut shrimp.. A very popular place, with Obama's visit as the most recent claim to fame...and they definitely play that up. Very much a college, cool kid's place feel. The servers are nice, the portions are generous. Got the classic bacon, eggs, and pancakes deal. The protein wasn't anything special but the pancakes were delicious! They look huge but are crepe thin. The edges are crisped and taste almost carmelized.. Best sushi in Arizona!!  I was super surprised at how fresh everything was.  The owner was so nice too!!!  I would go back again and again. This Restaurant is fabulous Matt K is one of the best servers I ever have met..he was very pleasent to have served us...Food I give it a 10 dessert as well. We will def. Will be coming back. The Iconic Montreal Orange is a must !

Like every kitshy awesome thing you'd find on the road, it makes the journey more interesting. Your typical roadside atttraction, the giant orange has a lot to offer. It's a fast food, burger, hotdogs, fries, poutines.... All served with their famous orange juice.

Nobody can figure out what the secret ingredient in the OJ is and sometimes it's just better not to know. :) I think it might be ice cream but no idea... Anyway it's awesome. 

The Orange Julep is legend and you have to try it. 

Just because it's a restaurant in an orange, not so much because of the food but you need to try the hole concept.

Not more expensive than a McDonald combo and so much more Montreal.. Great drinks, super friendly owner, very comfortable atmosphere. 

Solo offers whole, skim and soy milk options.. i've been buying cigarettes. gas, and snacks her for 3 years now, the service is incredible,, they know im disabled, and they fill my car for me, they have the most incredible donuts, only .10 cents mroe than Bosa's, but oh soo soo much better, 5 star rating for the most courteous staff. for a convenience store, its not much more than a regular grocery.. i hope someone see's this review. they r Circles above Circle K. Food and service were great!  We came here for dinner for the first time a few weeks ago.  It's inside the station square building, across from Buckheads. We loved all of the food we ordered and wished we can make them at home.  

We tried the kushi katsu, dynamite roll (spicy scallops) definitely spicy but love it, sashimi platter seems like a small portion for two but still worth it if you like sashimi bc of variety and taste.  The sashimi is fresh and definitely the best I've tasted in awhile.  

My hubby was still hungry after these, so we ordered the beef maki and curry calamari. The calamari was huge and we liked that the breading was soft but not soggy. It's hard to explain the texture. All sauces were on point as well.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the food.

I also tried the fujiyama cocktail which is vodka, pina colada and banana.  The glass was small, so I probably could've had 2 or 3 since it tasted good. Haha.  The price wasn't as bad as other sushi/japanese places.

Server was friendly, prompt and attentive. She even offered to validate our parking, which took $2 off.  We didn't know they validated.  I liked the ambience/decor.  I think they're going for an old school authentic japanese look.  My hubby said it was plain for his taste.  Overall, I recommend this place!. Cafe Rio used to be right near my work at 48th and Ray, but they moved to Gilbert so I am pretty bummed.

The salads are amazing, and you should DEFINITELY give one a try. They take a fresh homemade tortilla and warm it up, then layer it with veggie friendly beans, fresh lettuce, cheese, etc etc... and it is topped with THE most AMAZING cilantro dressing. 

I honestly crave this dressing and really wish that I could find a good bottle of it somewhere.

I cannot attest to the decor or service because I have not visited the area, but I would definitely grab that salad if I were ever in the area.. This is the best Chinese buffet I've ever been in Vegas! They have very good selection of Chinese food that you won't see in any other Chinese buffet! I think my favorites are Peking duck, custard buns, pork knuckles, and sometimes they also have dim sum dishes! When it comes to customer service they are top notch! Super friendly and they always fill up ur drink for you even though its actually a self serve lol.. I've never seen a Chinese buffet that has a staff that always smile at you and give you right away if you need something! This place is a must go if you want to pig out some Chinese food! ;). Overall, the food is good. I would say 3/5 for the food alone. Not great and nothing to write home about. Prices are fair--not high considering healthy food is usually at a premium relative to junk food but not cheap either. We got a salad, an egg entree, and a smoothie but I don't really recall which we got since it wasn't all that memorable.

Why 4 stars then even if the food is just 3/5 average? I remember the food being good and feeling a nice satisfied, clean (not bloated) full after which is rare when eating out and good if you're trying to eat clean. Also, I love the outdoor seating + that they're dog friendly.. Had the pleasure of dining at Matteo's for a private event. Atmosphere was cozy and inviting. The apps were wonderful. Beans and greens as well as the salads were full of flavor! However. My main course.... Was to die for! The pumpkin tortellini. Let me just say I have never had anything like it! We ended the evening with delicious Pettit fours. After meeting the chef and enjoying his wonderful creations this place instantly became a favorite!. Love Goldie's!  The food is yummy, great wings, and the home made chips are awesome.  It's kind of loud in there, so don't bring grandma, but other than that Goldie's is great.. Loved the show! I was entertained from start to finish and I was able to understand the story.  I've seen a variety of Cirque shows in both LA and Vegas and this was a really great show.  I like the fact that I was able to see acrobatics both in the water and out. I also loved the dancing woven in throughout the show! I do think that the tickets were pricey, but I guess you can't expect anything less in Vegas.  With having the show in the round, just about every seat was a good seat. I would recommend this show to others who are Cirque fans!. This place gets HIGH marks in my book!! I have been twice and I really don't know when I would stop.  I've had a few things on the menu (
soft pretzels & provolone Fondue, 
Chicken Curry, 
36 Hour pork rib, 
Butternut squash Cannelloni, and Bistro Steak).  All were extremely delicious and fantastic!!  We shared plates and the chef split the portions up for us. WOW!! As far as drinks go, my fave has to be the Acai Mojito.  It's one of those drinks that taste so good and before you know you are having number 3 and BOOM your drunk. LOL! 

The salty caramel desert is DIVINE!! Creamy custard goodness!!

I highly RECOMMEND this place! The decor is unique, mismatch furniture  and extravagant chandeliers. GENIUS!. St. Raw Berry is divine!!!. lowering my standards a little bit because there is only 1 actual dimsum place in madison? YES, but...
I went for the first time on saturday morning with 3 other friends, and we ordered around 8-9 dishes. I think it was a good amount and variety, and we almosttt finished it. we ordered the shumai (good), congee (good), chinese donut (great), rice cake wrap things with beef (okay), sticky rice (good), pork bun.. the more bready one (good).. and some others. overall, food was good.
i do think they are still working on figuring out their service and cart situation, but i'm hopeful! i shall take what i can get for now~ 
we ate as much as we wanted and paid ~15 bucks each, which i was happy with. i remember eating less and paying more when i went to places in both socal and norcal.. I'm come here for a quick country breakfast fix. Guaranteed to leave this place with a happy, full stomach. The servers are on their best game. I order, get my coffee, and served within 15 minutes or less on some days. Prices are right and even better, the servings are large here. Good for sharing. They offer smaller portions too, but be prepared either way. 

Their sweet cream pancakes are the biggest rave! I can't argue with that. They taste like birthday cake, minus the icing. Fluffy, moist, and the right amount of sweet. The country fried steak is a must try! Hailing from the mid-west, a good fried steak is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. They DO that here. They use the same technique with their hash browns. Add some Heinz 57 to them, you're in for treat.  

Although located in a busy area and at times can be packed full of people, it's worth making the stop. The lumberjack-like atmosphere and teddy bears gives this place its name. They do country right here folks.. We stumbled upon BLT since we were staying at The Mirage. Even though it was packed, we didn't have to wait for a table.

Awesome burger combinations! The meat was fabulous. I had a chicken sandwich with avocado and pesto - HEAVEN. The pesto was perfect, the chicken was juicy and plump, and the avocado? Oh so fresh.

My husband had a burger. Gimme. The meat was also juicy, flavorful, and rich. They didn't season it a bunch which I appreciated. It allowed the natural flavors to shine!

Their sweet potato fries were killer and while I didn't have a shake, they looked equally as divine. 

We loved it so much we came back Sunday afternoon for lunch! That time, I had the chopped vegetable salad - holy massive portion!

Reasonable prices for Vegas, fresh ingredients! How can you go wrong?. STACEY IS GREAT!! She makes me feel very comfortable and engages in conversation to TRY to get your mind off of what you may be waxing. LOL! I am glad I found her on YELP!. My new favorite breakfast place in Madison! I love it! The scones are amazing, as is the what looks like homemade jam. I had the SCC - scrambled eggs and cream cheese and chives. YUM! Great eastside atmosphere and just a cozy, homey feel.. I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Earl of Sandwich. Especially since now, everytime I go to Vegas, I only want to stay at Planet Hollywood Towers. Their sandwiches really delicious and they hit the spot after a late night of partying. My favorite sandwich though - The Turkey Holiday. It's turkey with stuffing and cranberry. AMAZING. I don't know if they still have it, but if they do.. everyone should try it! But, all of the other sandwiches are just as good!. I was really impressed with this Walgreens!  I went out of my way to go there because it is the closest location to me with a take care clinic inside.  The entire store is newly remodeled. The shelves are all back lit.  The pharmacy and the clinic have monitors to show you queue of people waiting for service.  This way you know if they are working on your script or it will show you when it is done and ready to be picked up.  The monitor for the clinic shows the estimated wait time.  There is also a section with deli foods and snacks that looked fresh and healthy.  The only problem is that the wait between being seen at the clinic an getting the script filled was VERY long.  I've also been to a CVS minute clinic and they put the scripts from the clinic ahead of everyone else as a courtesy.  I wish Walgreens would learn to adopt this policy.. BEST fried pickles in my life! I only travel to Charlotte occasionally on business, but when I'm in town the first place I hit up is the Penguin- just for the fried pickles.

The sweet potato fries are also the best I've had- they have this brown sugar based dipping sauce that is out of this world. It actually was no longer on the menu last time I made a visit, but our hero of a waitor went in the back and whipped it up himself.

The burgers are good and the BBQ is also pretty straight. But if you make the trip out to Penguin, you will be kicking yourself for the rest of your years if you don't order the fried pickles.. I am so thankful for a place like Changing Hands.  When the original store on Mill closed many years ago, I was so afraid I would lose my favorite local bookstore.   This is the kind of place you can wander for hours.  They have so much to look at besides books.  The best part is, they always have calendar of events, and I've been lucky to see some of my favorite authors.   I hope Changing Hands never goes out of business.. First time here, thanks to restaurant week, and it won't be my last!

Ocean Prime is a white modern looking structure with blue neon lights.
We sat out on the patio which has a beautiful fireplace and the architecture of the patio ceiling is really neat. They incorporated two circles into the ceiling to allow the palm trees to grow through. The patio door and wall is all glass and looks as though it can be slid off to the side to open up the restaurant when the weather gets cooler. The bar at the back is neatly lit with all the liquor bottles and I did see a separate area labeled "blu lounge" that must be their sports bar section cause 2 different TV's were seen, however I did not venture back there so the "sports bar" description may be inaccurate. 

Our server, Kristin, was very welcoming and quick with service. I started out with a candied walnut salad with goat cheese that was delicious and my friend got the Caesar salad which she enjoyed because she said the flavor wasn't over powering. My entree was the filet mignon that I asked to be cooked medium rare and WOW, did they do an amazing job. It was by far one of the best filet's I have every eaten, it just melting in my mouth. My friend ordered the crab encrusted talipia that was equally as delicious. We split the brown sugar glazed carrots as a side, need I say more? We both ended up with the creme brulee and both savored in the sweet goodness and thickest layer of caramelized sugar coating I have every seen (but greatly appreciated).

The only negative I have to mention is that the patio chairs are wood and thus super uncomfortable (my right buttcheek went numb at one point), but it was well worth the tastiness I experienced.  Ocean Prime is an upscale dining restaurant and I will be returning, but only for those special occasions due to my unfortunately limited wallet size :). Best hotel on the strip. Plus, they have the best club on the strip (Marquee). What more could you ask for in one place?. Luxy Nail is a new boutique nail salon situated in the same plaza as Japan creek market and Gold's Gym on Eastern / Serene. I adore the chic and trendy deco of this place. Contrary to your prototypical nail salon, Luxy is very clean and free of any acetone / nail polish chemical odor. Never had real nail UV gel polish before, I decided to try it out. I was surprised how fast gel polish dried and harden under UV lamp. The owner (Queena) is very charming and paying attention to every detail. She told me gel polish will maintain its high gloss and color without fading for 2-4 weeks. It does not chip/peel or snap off when you strike the tip of your nail on a keyboard (I will test this statement w/ real world work & house chore tests after 2 wks). Price here is pretty reasonable (you get what you paid for). They offer lots of cute Japanese nail art designs. I definitely recommend this place if you are fan of Japanese nail arts. 

I am a new fan of this boutique nail salon and UV gel polish!. This is one of my favourite places in the Old Town to go for lunch and coffee.

Good old soup, sandwich and cake as well as excellent Artisan Roast coffee.

The staff are lovely, and friendly and if you are regular, get to know your preferences and remember in advance which is lovely!  It's quite small though and you can't book so sometimes you'll have to chance your arm they'll be a table.

The only thing is, it's a real shame there's not a proper breakfast menu (porridge or anything more than a pastry!) as the cafe opens early in the morning but there isn't much of a selection other than coffee.

Recommend Stag Espresoo for delicious coffee and simple but tasty sandwiches and soup.. Came here to fix what "best nails" messed up! Kevin hooked it up like crazy! My nails are amazing!!! Thank u!!. What a great meal. :) I've read the reviews, been anticipating a visit, and was not disappointed. My husband and I got burgers, cooked exactly as we asked, my daughter got the special--chicken fettuccine alfredo with  portobello mushrooms--of course also sampled by her parents :), and it was savory and delicious. I'm excited to go back and try new dishes,  because I can see Chef Carlos is a man that loves to cook, and wants to create a great experience.. I got the soba bowl and detox juice which were both delicious and light. However, when asked what protein I wanted to add to the bowl, I was offered tofu as an option. I selected tofu and halfway through eating, I realized they had given me chicken. When I asked for them to change it, they responded that they did not have tofu. I would have appreciated being told that while I was ordering. Although I am not vegan nor vegetarian, I would have been extremely offended to find meat in my food if I were vegan. Other than that, food and service were excellent. Will be coming back!. I'm not sure why there are so many critical reviews.  This is not a James Beard foodie hotspot with a typical 6 month shelf life.  This is a great little local place you can count on to bring friends, have a date night or bring the family. 

My husband, kids and I have come to this location several times since we moved to the neighborhood and have been happy with the service and the food each time.  Are they flawless? No. But when something's not right, they make it right and with a great attitude.  

We love a good Scottsdale or Arcadia restaurant every now & then too but the service is always spotty. We are so grateful to be able to level set by coming back to our fresh, friendly little Humble Pie in a town full of chain disasters!. Seriously the cutest neighborhood I've seen in my year in AZ thus far!! Wishing I could move there as we speak.... I went there today to join the desert yarnies meetup.  Anthony took my order and directed me to where the yarnies sit.  He delivered my yummy bagel and addressed me by name 3 times,; when he took my order, delivered my order and when I left.  I only regret that I gave a fake name.  My name is hard to pronounce and spell so I always give an easier name in those situations ie Starbucks etc.  I'm sorry Anthony, you are so nice I'll fess up next visit.. Great restaurant for a business lunch.  Atmosphere is very cozy with dim lights. Even with the restaurant being pretty busy, our conversation was very intimate. They have a TV that plays a fish tank scene which is awesome. Their She-Crab soup is amazing and a must have.  All the menu items are named after local celebrities like Dell Curry and Steve Udelson which is a fun touch for the few of us Charlotte natives.

Side note, this restaurant seems to be a big hit with the senior citizen crowd. There were at least 5 tables filled with charming elderly women enjoying a little lunch.. I can't begin to say how pleased I was with Akila. I called late afternoon for a quote on my iPhone 6 screen repair. He was the lowest & most competitive priced. 

In all honesty, I mainly went because he was so nice on the phone. He told me he was available to come to me (travel repair) or, I was welcome to come to the shop. 

I'm not far from the business so I stopped in. 

Everyone was so pleasant & I couldn't be happier to meet Akila. He was quick to offer water and even Netflix while we were seated in the waiting area. My phone is now brand new & from start to finish id say it was about 25min! 

Fastest screen repair ever but, the overall experience was awesome. Customer service at its finest. I'm coming back soon to get my sisters phone repaired. Highly recommended. I took my Mom here for her birthday in December... I know, I'm late in reviewing. I'm originally from Boston and living in AZ I find good seafood at an affordable price is hard to find. 
My Mom and I split one of the seafood buckets.... the Boston one of course! It included lobster, clams, corn and sausage - it was the perfect size to please us both for dinner and I think it was priced fairly.
We enjoyed our meal and the staff occassionally broke out into song and dance which kept it lively and gave us a good chuckle too. It's not a fancy place by any means but so far one of the better places I've enjoyed for seafood here in AZ. Go in with a fun attitude and you'll enjoy yourself as much as we did.
Now if they could only open one of these places in N. Scottsdale or Phoenix.... Yum!  This place is a real treat.  We love crepes, so we had to try it.  We love the Rebel Special (we swap out the bananas for extra strawberries).  The crepes are made fresh to order, so they're warm and soft.  The ice cream (we like chocolate) is cold, and the fruit is sliced fresh in front of your eyes.  Rolled up like a soft ice-cream cone, it's a hand-held treat.  Reasonable prices, fresh ingredients, and they make it quickly.

It's about a 15-20 minute drive from the Strip area, but it's worth it.. What a great find!  We're in the area about once a year and have been looking for a place that has great wine selection, great food and great ambiance.  5th and Wine covers all our needs.  Our server Tam was very attentive to our needs, gave us great suggestions and allowed us to linger ver our wine.  We will DEFINITELY be back!!. They were very accommodating in getting us a last minute appointment! My husband and I were very excited to try out a couples massage for the first time on our honeymoon and we were very impressed! The owner made sure we got a same day appointment, texted us the address, and then Terry and Latrice, the therapists, made our massage amazing! We walked out feeling like brand new people and all the stress from wedding planning and traveling just melted away! The price was amazing too and if we come back to Vegas we will most definitely come back!. We have been a customer of J. Crimi since the day he opened his store 7 years ago. My husband & I had been at LensCrafters that morning with an appt waiting for an eye exam. While waiting we looked at glasses & got an idea of price & what it would be with my insurance. The exam was cancelled by my husband since they were running WAY late & we left. 

We happened to stop by Kmart & ran across Jim's boutique. He wasn't even officially opened for business yet. We told him about our waste of time morning at LensCrafters & what insurance we have. He set an appointment up for an eye exam that week. He even took time to show us some glasses when it was evident that he had ALOT to do already! That just goes to show how he goes out of his way for his customers. :)

The selection of glasses is unreal! High quality, unique frames, designer names and reasonable prices! Even though they did not take our insurance he provided the paperwork for reimbursement. All I had to do was send it in. We got a much better looking & quality frame from J.Crimi going out of network & doing the paperwork ourselves then staying in network with LensCrafters. 

We have been getting our glasses & sunglasses from Jim for the 7 years he's been open & wouldn't go anywhere else. We recommend ALL our friends to do the same. :). I frequent shopping malls more often than I should and Town Square, dare I say, is probably my favorite of them all. When this place first opened, having an outdoor mall closer to southwest LV was extremely refreshing. Years later, this place has only gotten better. There's a wide selection of restaurants, bars, and shops. The movie theatre and kiddie water park make it a sweet spot for any aged visitor. Perfect for walking the dog, too. And now with the arrival of GameWorks video arcade and bowling, Town Square is unstoppable!

The overall center is always well kept and well decorated. They host nice entertainment and charity events on a regular basis. It can get busy at times, but that's really just because we all know it's a great place to have a good time. What more needs to be said? There's just so much to do. Love it here.. We have ordered from here a few times now and gotta say, we just love this place! when we moved here, a year ago, we needed food quick (as we were painting our place before we could unpack). We just needed to eat, and feed the help (my mom), and we wanted to patronize a business that was close to our home. Needless to say, we were shocked at the yum factor, the pizza and salads were/are beyond great! We decided to stay in for our 20th anniversary, and ordered delivery from the Warm Springs location last Saturday eve...i have to say, they were better than ever. Try 'em, you'll like 'em, maybe love 'em!. I had been anxious to try this restaurant and am happy to report everything was outstanding. We shared the scallop special of the day, beef carpaccio,  fried rice, soup and coconut ice cream. 
The food was fresh, everything was balanced and tasty. 
I can't wait to go back again!. I love this place the atmosphere, the food, the service everything is always on par.  From looking at the photos from previous years it looks like they updated from a diner feel to a hipster coffee/ brewery type feel. I love the open kitchen design, you can see your foods being made fresh. Despite the design it doesn't smell like a diner so you don't leave needing to change your cloths. The service has a laid back and friendly feel but is always pretty speedy.  Sometimes we sit at that bar and that's always really nice and kind of fun too.  We love that this place is local and supports other local businesses.  The food? Always amazing. Healthy and more indulgent options to satisfy everyone. Plus there are a lot of create your own options to satisfy even the pickiest eater. My current fave is the farmers market omelet, the hubby loves the 3 dollar plate of bacon. Definitely stop here if your out in awatukee!. Went here for the first time and left full and happy. We had the sampler plate, jumbo potato with pulled pork, and apple crisp a la mode for dessert. Loved everything. This will be a new go-to for us.. I have been coming here for awhile. Bob is great, being a female I get a little nervous coming to these shops in fear of being ripped off...or telling me BS I don't need just to make extra money..but Bob will not try to sell you on any crap you don't need, straight to the point and straight to the problem...thank you guys! I will be a returning customer!

Wow what a great burger!! Pressed fresh daily, good quality bun, spend more get an expensive burger. These things are the best quality. Lots of odd drafts on tap as well. Good stop for an out of town-er.. The new location for UL is pretty well tucked away at the end of the new AJ's Shopping center but it is well worth finding.  Sounds like there were some issues they had to get over when they first opened but my experience was great!

Went for an early dinner at about 6 pm.  The service was prompt and our server was very friendly.  We ordered a Mediterranean pizza and Penne with Wild Mushrooms in Cream Sauce.  The Penne was amazing.  A wonderful mixture of different mushrooms in a delicate cream sauce over perfectly al dente penne.   I'm sure it's a million calories but I could easily have snarfed down another serving!  The pizza combination of artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, feta, banana pepper rings, etc was great.  The only reason I knocked a star off is the middle third of the pizza could have been crispier.  Of course that can be difficult with that many wet ingredients.

One side note for all you ladies with a fireman fetish.  There is a new fire station across the parking lot and the bar area was filled with at least a half dozen firemen.  So, if that's your cup of tea, then you might find someone to help put out your blazing inferno!. Newly modeled driving range with good music, alcohol and food.
There aren't a lot of places like this in North America, absolutely
a highlight of our trip to Arizona (about a 10 min cab ride from Scottsdale).
From what I have seen this place can get bumpin' on the weekends
and is a really great pre-game option before heading to a club.. The Original Nello's -- Established 1983 -- has been serving by far the best pizza. And it's not just the pizza, it's the whole menu. Salads with famous house dressing, Italian spaghetti and pasta, garlic bread with Italian "Margarita" pizza topping, sandwiches, oven baked barbecue chicken wings, and a selection of wine and craft beer.

Jack Salley
Mesa, AZ. If the comforts of a lazy boy and a cold beer don't get you hooked, the friendly staff and mgmt. will.  We don't go anywhere else unless we absolutely have to.
I love the idea of selecting your seats ahead of time.  There's no rush to get to the movie early as your seats will be waiting for you,

Try it.  You'll like it.. Excellent donuts and really great other pastry creations.  Prices are a little steep and I found the staff a little difficult, but I keep going back because they bake and serve great donuts!. Stopped in for some late night nachos and potato skins.   The nachos are still awesome, the skins not bad.

The place was not crowded for a Friday night and not really that bad as far as smoke goes.  It seemed like the people in there are regulars who hang out there often.

It was a pretty good mix even though it was light of men and women.  The food continues to impress and worth the visit.  It is nice to have a 24/7 place to grab some good food in a good atmosphere where you are taken care of and welcomed no matter if it's the first time, once in a while or a regular.

A good spot for late night hanging.. Absolutely delicious. So many flavors to choose from, almost everything you can think of. Definitely found a new spot I will be going to in the future and referring friends to. Friendly staff and good service.. My retired parents needed a new AC unit and when calling around found Black Mountain Air to be competitive with name brands.  Came out the same day and replaced the unit.  Todd was also able to help out with payment terms.  Very personable and professional.. One of my go to spots. Crab cake BLT is great...even with no bacon...5$ pitchers on happy hour which runs til 5..great servers and bartenders. This place knows how to treat guests. Veggie stack is awesome. Kids love brunch. Always a wait for Sunday brunch but its worth it. Go to the Windsor leave happy. Cool vibe. Classy hipster spot.. We had to put our dog to sleep today 04/13/2015.  The staff and Doctor were so nice caring and made sure that you felt comfortable as possible.. Enjoyed this establishment for lunch while walking up and down the strip...  Don't think i have ever had this quality for lunch, very impressed with the quality of our orders.  didn't get anything to drink other than water, but look forward to going back and sampling the absinthe drink they offer.  Would I go back?  I would go out of my way to hit up this place for lunch again.. Such an awesome place to eat Mexican food! The staff and the owners are very friendly. Very clean and the food there is very tasty. Try getting their flan!!. I've been here twice before, and was there again recently. It gets pretty packed, but for good reason. The food is absolutely delicious. There is an extensive menu ranging from vegetarian dishes to wild dishes such as trout, deer and even frog. Service is always great, but no 5 star since wait time to get seated is sometimes beyond long. Last time i waited over 2 hours to get seated..... As the owner of a small electrical company (Soft Cell Electrical) I rely heavily on the professionalism of my suppliers. Bulbman has always been able to locate some very obscure bulbs.  Sometimes it takes a while, but when your ordering out of Country this cannot be avoided. Usually any items ordered within the US are available within 1 to 2 business days. I highly recommend this company. John Cook company owner.. Pros:
Cookie skillet!
Pablo Picasso salad
Pizza
Meatball sub (ask for extra sauce- they never put on enough)
Top 5 wings of all time!

Cons:
Parking is non existant
Limited inside seating
Wait during busy hours
Service quality varies. I really enjoy this Water and Ice location. The people are always very personable here, are eager to help, and always seem to be in a good mood. 

There is also a good selection of things here. You can get your normal water and ice stuff, but in addition they have great ice cream, shaved ice, and a ton of treats. I take my family there every once in a while just to get a scoop if I've cream and hang out. I definitely recommend them.. I like coming to RR - I'm usually here once a week or every other week as I'm part of their beer club ($25 bucks a year for one free beer a week in your own mug - can't beat that!) 52 beers on tap with changes pretty regularly. I love the vibe in here with the decor and pool tables, darts, etc. plenty of big televisions to enjoy multiple sports. They've expanded their food menu so there are more options now. There are only two reasons why I can't give them 5 stars: 1). They don't have pizza (what is a sports bar without pizza?) 2). The service can be pretty slow at times. Seems like their POS system may have issues as a lot of the staff spends a great deal of time there. I'd recommend checking it out but you have to sit at the bar if you want decent service since there are no servers, just bartenders.. Brought in another one of my toys to the guys at Trophy!! Todd replaced my springs on my 20th anniversary GTI and also added sway bars as well as some shiny new Brembo Big Boys!!! These guys are always on point!! Had to leave another review because they deserve it!. Been waiting for a place like this to open! Was here on it's grand opening and to my surprise they had more than your standard Filipino turo turo fare! Such a relief to walk in and be greeted by beautiful smiling ladies! I went for the sisig and pinakbet and it was scrumptious! Then the daughters of the owners walked by offering free bite sized samples of leche flan and buko pandan, seriously which filipino turo turo establishment does this nowadays?!!!  Of course i needed some water to wash everything down so i did with some lemon infused water. Woohoo!!!  Again, fresh delicious food, lovely and beautiful staff!!!! Nanay's made me come back the following day for their breakfast buffet. Lol!. This place was freaking awesome. Nice club, rather interesting entertainment, awesome music. 

We've never been here before, but I'd love to go back. The dance floor is intense. The pole dancer? Whoa! 

Celebrated a friends birthday here. They had food drinks and an arcade. 

Get crazy!. Just had the Cordon Blue special...AWESOME! 
Really friendly  service and the deck was a great place to chill with my lunch chow!. Freddy came to my home today and did a FANTASTIC job. He was prompt, professional and courteous. He even went above and beyone what I asked...5-stars all the way. Thank you Freddy and we'll see you again the next time we have any plumbing problems.
- Sean. FINALLY got  chance to try Studio B.  I've been to M so many times but I was never able to try it because of a few things: long ridiculous lines and they aren't open at midnight :[

Went on a Saturday around 5:30p since we didn't want to wait, and yes, we did drive out of Vegas for about 20 minutes just for the buffet.  Studio B is located inside the modern M resort, and is probably the biggest draw of the hotel.

Once we paid and were seated, I immediately went for the carving stations.  Prime rib, BBQ ribs, lamb, turkey, roasted chicken... everything was there.  Of course, I started out with the prime rib because for me, the quality of the prime rib can sometimes make/break a buffet.  Surprisingly, M Resort had one of the best prime rib I've had a buffet, anywhere!  The seasonings on the crust, the medium-rare doneness, and the au jus all came together for a delicious tasting prime rib.  The braised short rib was my 2nd favorite.  Didn't expect the buffet to have tender short ribs.  

A lot of people liked the BBQ ribs, including me, but I do have to say, it is a bit fatty so that may turn some people away.  The poultry were all good, but for some reason they didn't have chicken breast, only the dark meat.  Not that I was really complaining since I always prefer the more juicy part of the bird.

As for the seafood, that's what all others went for first.  The highlight is definitely the crab leg!  Mounds and mounds of crab legs.  It's not split in half for you like some of the buffets at the high end hotels (Wynn, Bellagio), but it is cracked open at strategic spots so it is quite easy to crack the legs.  However, one thing I do have to say that it was extremely salty and that some just looked sorta odd with brown and green spots.

There's also unlimited raw oysters!  A few of my friends totally went berserk but I sorta held back since I've had bad experience with raw oysters and will only eat the ones that has a pure clear liquid, but that's just me.  The fact that they offer raw oysters is amazing to me though.

There's also an Asian section, which is the same as everywhere else.  Hot foods such as mashed potatoes and fried fish is there as well.  My favorite was definitely the fried calamari with marinara sauce.  It's like free and unlimited appetizer that you would have to pay 10-12 bucks for at any restaurant!

As for the desserts... I didn't care much for the cakes but they do have creme brulee (I'm a sucker for it) and gelato ice cream!  Creme brulee is creamy and tasty.  For the gelato, lemon was definitely my favorite.  Sweet but just enough tang for you to pucker.  

Another huge draw for the buffet is the unlimited beer & wine.  3 types of beers on draft and a red/white wine option.  It's sorta hidden in the corner and a lot of people thought you had to pay but it's just people giving tip.

Seriously, I have a craving to go back.  It may not be the best quality and it is a little out of the way, the price, selection, and unlimited alcohol definitely pushed this buffet into the 5 star realm!. The Deuce is a great alternative to taking a taxi. $5 for 2 hours, $7 for 24 hours, and $14 for 72 hours is not a bad deal if you consider taxi prices. The later in the day the more traffic there is, so plan on it taking some extra time to get to where you are heading. Even if it is slow, its worth it to get a good tour of the strip without having to walk infinity miles. Plus, who wants to walk off all the food you just ate after eating at a Vegas buffet when you can sit on your ass on a bus? America!. This is the next best thing to being in Taiwan.  The food is remarkably authentic and delicious.  I usually get the fried pork cutlet meal which includes rice, some pickled vegetables, bok choy, and a hard boiled egg.   It reminds me of the little bento lunches you get at Taiwanese train or bus stations.. Looked up the newly added businesses in town and i saw two things about Nosh & Swig that caught my eye, Tapas and east side of town. They wife and i ordered ALOT of food for the 2 of us but we didn't eat all day since we new were were going here. Everything we had had great flavors and was presented beautifully. There is so much more to try and I can't wait to go back! Service was outstanding and the staff and owner stopped to have a conversation with us.. The new edition to the Tunnel Espresso brand is fun and they make full use of the additional space they have. 
They have a couple benches and a nice big coffee table. 

At the time of this review they were serving espresso and filter drinks from Toronto roaster, Detour.  

The baked goods also looked appetizing and fresh. They have a wider selection then their original location. 

The espresso I received on my first visit was well pulled, given it was not from one of my favourite roasters (over roasted for my taste). The barista managed to hold off the acidity and keep it smooth. 

Overall an enjoyable experience.. My wife and I enjoy this place.  It is always fun to go and get dirty.  I will give this place 5 stars because they have great specials if you go at the right time, service is great, food is great, and just an overall great experience.

You must have the crab cakes at this place, really some of the best.. While not Chicago-grade, this certainly isn't no slouch either (chicago has 2 floors of men's goodies).  

Surprisingly, a good choice of sale selection, up to 60% off, picked up a dress shirt, regular-price $155, now $62.  Just love the low sales tax here lol.

Lots of comfortable seating while waiting around for the missus.

Minor beef are the lousy, cramped changing rooms, with no locks.. The worlds best hot dogs I will drive as far as I need to for these !!!! Awesome prices for these amazing dogs.. Very relaxing. Hallways are dirty. Awesome pools. I am originally for a suburb of Los Angleles called Carson,  where they had some of the best small Mom & Pop short order burger joints,...... Apollos, Carson Burgers, Ted's Burgers and Yellow Basket and more along those lines another place pretty famous called Tommy's Burgers or as the locals call it, "Tommy's"

When this place opened up the smell reminded me of being back home so I ordered a double cheeseburger combo with fried zucchini and instantly was taken back.

An extra large menu choice with great prices, so if your headed west on Lake Mead Blvd maybe to do some bowling at the Texas or just heading out to the Wal-mart, make a quick stop here and get your grind on.. Awesome late night pizza! Friendly staff, and quick service.

Lots of creative toppings, and nothing is skimped.
I had the gyro pizza and I think some sortof salad pizza. Both were great!
I opted out of the mac and cheese, I need to leave that for next time.

I just wish I stopped by Moes across the street before eating the slices to try duff beer.. First time here & I am impressed with the food presentation & most importantly--it's quality. Their lunch menu & happy hour are affordable. Place can be crowded especially on the weekends. I will definitely come back here again!. Jump right in the margaritas are fine! Its a restaurant with a lot of character. I came on karaoke night which was done completely in Spanish! How awsome is that. From just walking in the door could tell this place wasn't you average Mexican spot. The menu offers what I took to be more traditional Spanish dishes and not just chimis and taco salads.  The service was prompt and adequate to be fair I came late night. I got the milanesa....AMAZING. DEEP FRIED STEAK.  The food put me over the moon and the barkeeps were on it. The food is worth what you pay for. The amount you get on your plate is enough to feed a small family and a horse! Well maybe not the horse too but you won't leave hungry. All and all the restaurant is worth your time believe me you won't be disappointed.. I'm going here for lunch today. They're offering meal deals in celebration of Cinco de Mayo. I've never been disappointed and often pleasantly surprised. Desserts are homemade delights! Text the words TACOSPOT to the number 90210 to be alerted about instant specials.. I've had BG bookmarked for a long time and now that I've been I am a big fan.  One of the first things I noticed was the very enthusiastic owner who seemed so excited about his food and everything.  That is one of my favorite traits of an owner, when they are excited about their food and excited about the people are going eat their food. The line was almost out the door and I could hear the excitement from right at the door.  Which is always a good sign.  I think we all ordered the Bosc!? Bosk!? Bosq!? however you spelt it it's all sounds at least 6 of us maybe 10 just because how he explained what went inside.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baguette-cafe-las-vegas-2?select=5LkJ582csgxifnT_0pTL1A#5LkJ582csgxifnT_0pTL1A It wasn't on the menu but ask for it you're going to enjoy it. It was delicious.  I also picked up a green tea frappe.  Just trying to stay cool.

Everything they made looked and smelt so good. I wanted everything.  They made sandwiches, pastries, soups, salads, frappes, and coffee drinks.  Items are reasonably prices. It was very busy during a mid week lunch and the seats filled up.  There are more seats outside in front and if you're lucky some in the shade of a tree. I was fine with eating outside even though it was hot there was a nice breeze. 

I have their quiche and their other sandwiches on my radar.  I'm just going to work my way through everyone's pictures. I'll be here more often.. No longer a Korean Cuisine Virgin . . . and even though I have nothing to compare this place too . . . it was fabulous.

First the Service . . . Seating quickly and our drink order was taken immediately.  When the waitor return with the drinks, he walked us through their menu . . . pointing out his favorite dishes . . . but more importantly . . . helping us decide between the two  dishes we were interested in . . . this is great since at that point I was still a korean cuisine virgin.

My choice . . . with my wiater's recommendation . . . Nakji Dol Pan . . . Octopus stir fried in a spicy sauce and served on a sizzling stone plate.

Second the Food . . . the food came quickly and was unbelievable . . . though spicy, not too spicy . . . however, the spiciness does grow on you over time.  The octopus, was cooked perfectly and almost melted in your mouth . . . and the side enhanced the overall taste of the dish.

I will now definately try other Korean Restaurants . . . but it will be hard to surpass the experience I have here at Hodori Restaurant.. Good food and reasonable pricing. The won ton  soup is always good. My wife loves their Thai selections while I gravitate to the pork dishes. The double cooked pork is good but beware it can be spicy hot.

I agree with the other reviewer the decor is a little dated but I go there for the food not an interior decorating experience.. I had my tint completely redone by Brian at SmartFilm a couple weeks ago. Before going to him the last time my car was tinted was back before I bought my car, which was in 2006. So it was at LEAST 8 years old!

I own a 1999 BMW M3. I had Brian install 5% of the Ceramic tint on the rear windows, 30% Ceramic on the front windows, and the Air 80 (I think that's what it was called).

The difference was night and day! Before going to Brian, the AC in my car just couldn't keep my interior cool. I'd have it on max but it would still be warm in the car due to the lack of heat rejection.

After going to Brian I can now leave my car outside in the 100+ degree heat for a couple of hours, then jump in my car and within 5-10 minutes my interior is nice and cool. Not only that but my black leather is not even hot like it used to be.

Now my interior gets cool to the point where I have to actually turn down the AC because it gets too cold! 

Go to Brian, he's the best!. Fantastic place. We had lots of fun although we were beginners. Very accommodating. 
Scott helped us diligently and with lots is patience! If you want to go for shooting g go here.. Fredo's does do a great job of portraying a family deli in the heart of Dormont. I've tried a few of their sandwiches and have to say that my go-to favorite has to be the Italian. IT"S AWESOME!!

I like to go in and see all the authentic candy, drinks, whatever kind of stuff they have on the shelves that are in labeled in languages I can't pronounce. It's also an added benefit that the employees talk to each other in a foreign language. 

Nothing is cooler than going to a place and hearing the workers yell at each other in a foreign language. Are they talking about you? Are they talking about the food? Who knows...? It's all mysterious, and it adds to the excitement of getting your food. 

I always polish my sandwiches down with an ice cold Fanta or Orange soda. I suggest you do the same yo... This venue is great every time. Always a classy place. Crowd seems to be a good mix of the city whenever I attend. I've been to see Sergio Mendes & Book of Mormon (thanks Yelp LV!). Enjoy the outside area when you go.. I've been to a few massage places, but I went here and got ken, he is amazing! He listens, makes sure your comfortable, and I never felt better! Will be coming back on a regular basis especially because it's also quite afforable.. Another Cirque that should get 3.5 stars.  Why?  Allot of people have this as there number 2 Cirque, possible number 1.  I have seen all the Cirque's on the strip except One...LOVE.  Ka, is I think my number 3(Maybe).  But, enough with personal.  Ka, is awesome theatre!  The effects in this show is what makes it great!  They make you believe in all that they do.  From boats, to drowing and swimming.  Climbing mountains, and even shooting arrows across the theatre!  They pretend there animals, and the stage has actors, and artists flying off the stage.  Like all Cirques the ushers keep you entertained from the moment you walk in.  Then the actors, keep you in the story by walking around the theatre almost at least once in every scene.  And finally all the effects and some, I stress some, acrobatics keep you locked in.  The Stage, The Show, and the Fireworks at the end make it a must see.  ***Do a stand-by ticket on Thursday night if you can.  The seats are amazing.  Be there by 6, and you might get Center Row for half price.!. If you are gluten free (not by choice if I may add), this is the place to get your baked goods!

Their bread, bagels, pizza crusts and english muffins are all delightful, the doughnuts are pretty good too.

Their eat in cafe on McDowell is really nice and has a great menu.

Ask for LynnRae she will be of major help if you are new to this establishment. 

Get going people and head over!. PINK RHINO HANDS DOWN THE BEST STRIP CLUB IN ARIZONA!!! Good service, polite professional staff and amazing entertainment! I've been going to strip clubs since 1999 and out of all the clubs I've ever been to PINK RHINO stands out and is superior above all. Bottle service VIP and entertainment wise the best for your buck. When it comes to strip clubs I won't spend my money anywhere else!!!! Thank you PINK RHINO!. This hotel is very nice, the exterior is very pretty.  Our room was nice, clean, and had a nice shower with dual heads.  The beds were only full and we would have preferred queen since we had to share beds.

Some disappointing things about the hotel, internet is not free 15/day. The food and convenience store are expensive ( I know its vegas).  Also if you don't vallett, be prepared to carry your luggage all through the parking lot, then through the casino and back through to get to your room!  In 100 degree heat its not fun :(    But all in all nice hotel and the pool is relaxing even though we attended pool party's at other hotels during most of the day.. If it can be done to Guinness, Lis Doon Varna is doing it. I loved the Irish Car Bombs. They used their homemade whiskey-based cream liquor for them, and it was amazing.

I get annoyed by the generic Irish pubs on every other corner, sporting nothing but a shamrock here and a Guinness ad there, but the decor at Lis Doon is refreshing. I'll update my review when I come back for the food...but don't let me have too many pints. Guinness and Cider is addictive.. Staff was very friendly and the coffee was made quickly and taste very good. I would highly recommend this place for anyone trying to support local coffee shops.. Awesome service, and incredible food! We were at Alex's table and he was a great server. I was really impressed because most high end places take all night bring food thinking you want to be there the whole evening. They did a wonderful job keeping our pace moving through glasses of wine, apps, lobster bisque,  the main course and we were in and out in an hour and a half and had a tremendous experience. Will be back!. Share meals tapas style. Bring a date or a group and check this spot out. Seating is limited and no reservations all for a reason. This is a must try in clt.. Now this place has an awesome buffet. I was totally disappointed with Las Vegas Indian resturants and then made it to this one on the last day of our trip. Can't say enough about this place. The food was delicious, fresh, with enough variety and each dish was a pleasure to taste. The decor was nice and Indian and even the restrooms were clean. Very satisfied, highly recommend.. great concept, great people, great fun.  worth the short trip from the strip!. Corner breakfast shop with a family atmosphere and very welcoming staff. Our server was always attentive and made the experience exceptional! Will come back again:). I came in tonight and had a amazing time. I live in Scottsdale and spend a lot of time in biltmore and Arcadia... my restaurant bar is pretty high. The lamb skewers were literally the best meat without a1 or bbq sauce I've ever had. One of the owners/management was there, they were very concerned to make sure we enjoyed our experience. They deserve my rating, check it out for itself!. Feinkostladen und Bistro in Ettlingen. 

Hier gibt es eine Menge Leckereien, die man prima für sich oder als Geschenk für andere kaufen kann. Angefangen von der Frischetheke mit Antipasti, Wurst und Käse, bis hin zu leckeren eingemachten oder getrockneten Spezialitäten. 

Zu dem Laden gehört ein kleines Café und ein Restaurant mit abwechselnden Mittagstisch. Leider in Summe nicht ganz billig, dafür aber top Service und top Qualität.. Most enjoyable!"

To stay at the Palazzo is most enjoyable when my wife & I decide to escape to Vegas. We never had any disappointments and most our requests are always granted with a smile. The casino floor has everything you really need except for the drinks. I found them to be weaker and weaker and you don't see the servers very often so we decided to go to the bar instead especially the Champagne Bar.Play a little machine and get a great drink with the alcohol of you choice.
It was our 4th stay and we will be back. Love this place we got so muc b food we had a lot of left overs if yur looking for a sit down with a rustic look this is the place.. Great bike shop.  I took my bike there for a tune up.  They surpassed all of my expectations with respect to price, service skills, and friendliness.  I finally found a bike shop that I like.  I highly recommend their service!. Yeah I'm a fan.  Been too long since I have gone to the Greek Festival in Dilworth but that is my loss.

Was originally going to go on Thursday night but we had torrential downpours in the area.  Went this afternoon (Sunday) and the weather could not have been nicer.  Clear skies, light breeze and temperatures in the 70's.

It was crowded as ususal so we ended up parking four blocks away and walking.  It was a pleasant walk and gave us a chance to see they old houses of Dilworth that were being renovated.

The festival was fantastic.  Several stages with dance exhibitions, great Greek Food and you could eat in or they had outside tables where you could also eat.

One high point was the fact that the priests gave lectures on the Cathedral, it's art and the significance of that art and differences between Eastern Orthodox vs Western or Roman Catholic practices.

The Cathedral is one of the most beautiful houses of worship in the Charlotte area and well worth taking the weekly tour at 3 pm on Saturday the rest of the year.

As I said, been a number of years since I have been but will be back next year.. I've been here twice now and the carne asada is on point.  They cook the beef over mesquite lump charcoal while many of the others cook it on a flat top.  That means flavor and the flavor of the beef is outstanding.  The menu is limited but what they do serve is all very good.  The flour tortilla is nice and dense with plenty of lard while the corn tortilla was soft and supple.  They also have a salsa / topping bar with items like shredded cabbage, limes, radishes, pickled onions, avocado salsa, a hot salsa and another salsa I didn't try.  

The atmosphere is lacking and there is bar seating inside with about 3 or 4 tables outside.  The service is great and both times I was greated warmly and they seem to appreciate that you are there.  

All in all, this is where I will now go for carne asada.  America's is eh, Tacos Atoyac is awesome but I've never been wild about their carne asada and many other places simply can't match the flavor of the meat here and really, isn't that what it's all about?. I want to share my first experience with dining at the Estate House. Last Monday evening August 17 my wife and I decided we needed to unwind after a long day. We chose to try Estate House for dinner. We moved to Scottsdale 22 months ago from New York City. The first thing that struck the two of us was the elegant ambiance of this local restaurant. The chateau like interior seemed to transport us to a far away land. We were greeted warmly by the General Manager Zoran Klisara who seated us at a very comfortable table. Our next greeting came from a young server by the name of Krista who I discovered was a Nebraska native. All I can say is that Krista embarked with us on a journey of food discovery and joy. In all the years of living and dining in NYC we had never had a server more passionate and knowledgeable about the tastes and food delights that were being offered on their exquisite menu. The summer prix fixe menu, offering 3 course meals ranging from $20, $30 and $40 were an amazing value. I started with mussels that were absolutely delicious followed by chicken superbly cooked served on a mash potato with spinach. My wife started with a wonderful mixed tender greens salad that she loved. For her main course she had prosciutto wrapped halibut which she said was to die for. I have to agree as I snuck a taste. Our dinner was accompanied with an awesome Cabernet called Mercer from Washington State. Their wine selection is extensive and quite impressive. Our dinner ended with an incredible array of desserts. I chose the "Gianduja marshmallow Napoleon"  with Strawberry Italian Soda. I was in dessert heaven. My wife chose the "Brioche Creme Brulee" butterscotch, fresh raspberries. She soon joined me in dessert heaven. The Estate House proved to be the best decision I had made all day! We can't wait for a return visit.. Excellent experience with Dr. Patel and his staff.  I was a new patient but was able to get an appointment the same day I called!  The new patient form was one page and didn't require my complete medical history.  I was brought back promptly and had my vitals taken by a very courteous nurse.  The doctor came in immediately thereafter and examined me for my chief complaint.  He took the time to explain my illness and how he was going to treat it.  He also took the time to ask me about my family history of major medical diseases and if I had any other health concerns besides what he saw me for!  Very professional and caring doctor.  I highly recommend Dr. Patel!. Great place to gay watch. Total suburban vanilla meat. You know probably drives a Toyota but wants that little lexus. Lawyer not a partner or his bf is a lawyer and he's a manager at some chain sports pub. You know what I'm talking.. I saw this establishment when I flew in for work and was looking for some burgers for dinner. Turned this app on and Viola!! BurGR, by Gordon Ramsay. So we give it a go.

Fries are out of this world!!! Specially the Truffle fries. The burgers were good, but isn't the best I've ever had. Sorry guys. That being said, I would probably come back here to try the other burgers or maybe some of the appetizers. They look amazing. (",) happy eating!!!. Everyone was so very helpful; answered all of my questions and greeted me warmly. I used to come here a few years back with my dad when he was still alive. It was one of his favorite places for a good breakfast. My wife had seen this place the other day as we drove past so yesterday when we were discussing whether to make breakfast at home or go out, I decided to come to Ronnie's.

Upon arrival the parking lot was packed. I expected a long wait. However, we were seated in about 10 minutes.

We immediately noticed the knick knacks on the walls. It gave me a "grandma's house" feeling. It was very pleasant. 

Our waitress was very polite and attentive. Couldn't have asked for better. 

My 5 year old ordered a pancake breakfast off of the kids/senior menu. The plate consisted of a pancake bigger than I could eat if I tried, eggs, and a big sausage. She loved it!

My wife had an omelet. I don't know what it was but it looked AMAZING!

I ordered a skillet with eggs, potatoes, chorizo, jalapenos, and tons of cheese. I tried as hard as I could to finish it but I only managed to down half. Flavor is spot on. In fact, it is my lunch today.

This place is an absolute must visit!. Once a month, I treat myself with 2 bagelmania garlic bagels and a half pound of cornbeef. I can't think of a better meal. 

Keep note: if you eat here once, you will get uncontrollable craving for their food. Nothing will satisfy but the real thing.

I've been told the staff is grumpy, but they've always been very nice to me.. Travis Constant was extremely helpful and thorough during the process of buying our home.  The whole process went smoothly and the communication was great.  I'd definitely reccommend Hendry Home Mortgage and Travis Constant to any of my family and friends who are in the market to purchase a home or refinance their existing mortgage.. Pretty good thai food in downtown. However, the portions are way way too small for its price. When I work near downtown, this is my goto place to eat for lunch. Dinner, it gets too crowded especially weekends!. I stopped into Brio for a mid-week lunch with a large group of co-workers.  After quickly arranging a couple of tables, we were seated promptly on the large patio.  The first thing I noticed, and really my only complaint, is that the patio chair are insanely uncomfortable. I've never worn ass pants, but perhaps this is what it feels like.

Our server was very friendly, and helped us newbies with the menu. There is a nice selection for lunch with reasonable prices.  I had the Grilled Salmon Fresca, which was a perfect portion for lunch. It had grilled red peppers, asparagus, sweet potatoes, spinach, and tomatoes.  On top was a small portion of feta, some fresh basil and a light drizzle of balsamic.  The Salmon was grilled nicely and overall the dish was light and flavorful, just perfect!

The inside of the restaurant is spacious and very classy.  It looks ideal for a romantic date night.  Although I only had 1 meal here, I would definitely recommend Brio!. I swear each event is better than the last and this is hands down my favorite yet.  Not only was the wine and food amazing but learning about how and why they chose them.  I'm slowly warming up to wine and events like this have been helping me learn more so I can enjoy them more.

Oh, and the drawing at the end was awesome ;) I will without a doubt be going back now.. I have been staying at the Bellagio Hotel for YEARS and I can honestly say that it is by far the best hotel in Las Vegas.  I have stayed at almost all other 4 and 5 star hotels in Las vegas in the past but Bellagio is better than all of them.  It is beautiful, classy and amazing service.  It is located right in the middle of everything so once you Valet your car and check in, you will not need your car again until you are ready to leave.  You can walk everywhere.. One of my favorite Thai places in Vegas, and they fixed my one complaint about the place, they remodeled it so it looks way better!!!!

Grilled beef salad, pineapple fried rice, pad se ew with shrimp *shoves face into food*

One of my Vegas top 10 for sure!!!!  Don't expect to get the greatest service because you are not paying that much for the food.  But don't get me wrong, everyone is really nice and courteous, just don't expect a sommelier (I googled the spelling of that) to explain their wine list to you.  The place is packed, sometimes you gotta wait a while to get a table, sometimes you will be ignored when you want someone to take your order, sometimes you may feel rushed.  But you know what?  It's still THAT good, and everyone comes back.  

Speaking of thai food, can someone invent a somewhat healthier version of Thai Iced Tea?!?  We have invented cellular phones, we send space ships to the moon, but we can't make a healthy Thai Iced Tea???!!!!!!  I was excited earlier, but now I am upset!!. BRING WATER! 

My favorite mountain in the city. The toughest one out of all them. If you are tourist and reading this during the summer. DO NOT EVEN TRY TO HIKE THIS unless
1. You are in moderately good shape 2. You wear appropriate clothes 3. BRING TONS OF WATER 

Plenty of tourist die on this mountain for various reasons each summer.

BRING WATER!

Otherwise I climb camelback a few times a month fall-spring. I've done it a few times during the summer not as enjoyable. 

If you are a newbie just come prepared. Trail shoes or actual rock climbing boots work the best I wouldn't suggest wearing your regular running/work-out shoes although a lot of ppl do but it gets slippery at times especially going down mountain. don't wear jeans or flip-flips trust me you'd be surprised.  

BRING WATER!

sunblock is a must if you're climbing it in the summer yes black folk you too. I got sun burn on my nose for the first time in my entire life after climbing Camelback last year during the summer.

Best times to go is either at sunrise or after 3pm (it doesn't get dark until about 7:30p during the summer)  if you go 9am-2p good luck finding parking.

Depending on how in shape you are be prepared to take around 2-3 hours to complete (going up then coming back down)

BRING WATER!. Super fun place.  The talent is very approachable and interact with the crowd very well.  They are VERY talented.  It's a great place to spend the evening chilling and singing with your favorite tunes.. Awesome, Awesome, Awesome.  Went here for a friends birthday and the service, food and atmosphere was just awesome. 

We had a party of 20 and they did their best to make sure that we had a great time.  I had some steak and some fish, but that was not the best thing I had.  I ordered the Cesar salad on the recommendation of the food server and it was amazing. They make it fresh there from a recipe that is known to be the original recipe.  I actually was with the manager as he made it for me and I assisted with some of the ingredients.  

I have to be honest, this was the best salad that I have ever had.  I mean EVER.  The best part was the fact that he actually gave me the recipe as well!  Boooo Yaaaa!. Very very funny, the hosts are incredible and have an incredible energy.  I was laughing the whole time.  Mimi and the police officer made me laugh so much, their simple demeanor even if they don't say anything makes me laugh.

The murder mystery portion is difficult to follow just because the hosts are so funny it's almost distracting.  But honestly, just go to have a good time.  Don't go in there looking for a CSI experience.. This little gem is slightly hidden at the intersection of Decatur and Vegas.  While the address suggests Decatur, the restaurant parallels Vegas Street.  The location and ambiance are the only factors that keep this place from a 5-star rating.

Myself, the wife, and the child arrived on a Sunday, in the early afternoon.  We seated ourselves, but within seconds, a very attentive waitress was on the scene with menus and asking what we would like to drink.  She attempted to engage the 7 year-old, and was very pleasant.

I ordered the Eggs Benedict for about $7.95.  The Benedict came with choice of potatoes.  The portions were quite nice.  The cup of coffee was $1.25.  The wife ordered a cheese omelette for about $4.50.  The omelette came with toast and potatoes, and was also a nice sized portion.  The wife also did a full order of bisquits and gravy for about $3.50.  I helped with the bisquits and gravy, and they were really tasty.  One could order that meal and be quite full.  The daughter ate a grilled cheese with potato chips for $3.95, off the children's menu.  Her cup of hot chocolate was $1.25.  

The food was served hot and fast.  The waitresses kept the coffee cups filled.  The food was quite tasty.  The portions were in excess of what you'd expect for the price (think of this place as the anti-France).  The menu had many items I will want to try in the future (for example, there is a New York steak breakfast for about $8.75).  They serve waffles, pancakes, a good variety of sandwiches and salads for lunch.  Overall, the Sunshine Cafe is a great value.  

This restaurant is listed on Restaurant.com, and it's possible for a first time diner to purchase coupons, but the prices are so low, you may find it difficult to spend enough to use the coupon.. My first Gordon Biersch location ever, and it was a good experience. I stopped by for lunch due to having my car worked on a couple of blocks away, and discovered that there is plenty of seating behind the bar (the bar itself was packed). 

The lunch menu choices were decent, and I wound up getting the flat bread. The presentation of it was nice, yet if I had the choice to get something else, I would. The flat bread tasted as if it was a small entree served on a cracker. Very, very thin and without much blended flavor within the bread. Yet I was okay with this, due to trying the various German beers. After sampling a small beer flight (3 samples), I went with the Schweitzbier. In two words: pure bliss. I ultimately ordered 3 Schweitzbiers, which pretty much summed up my lunch order with the flat bread. 

Customer service was fine, and without issues. I am certainly coming back to this location!. An amazing experience, no pain. Dr Degen  was super profession, experienced 0 pain. I would recommend this place to everyone.. Love is an understatement; I am OBSESSED with Whole Foods!  This place has everything for my grocery needs.  Their buffet-style food bar is so convenient whenever I'm in the mood for a quick eat but would rather not eat fast food.  Everything is so fresh and healthy which makes me come back for more.

Their selection of wine and cheese is awesome.  The selection of seafood is also great and of highest quality.  Although I wish they had a closer location to uptown (or even University), I don't mind making the weekly trip to this place.  Don't come to Whole Foods thinking you're getting just one item - you'll leave with a bag (or two) full with delicious food to eat or prepare!. Great price, great service. The lady who cut my hair knew exactly what i was talking about even though i am horrible at explaining things. I got the exact haircut i was looking for. They give you a free soda with your haircut...SWEET lol. 

Its a nice mom and pop style barber shop which i love. This is definitely now my haircut place for phoenix..and its a really really good price... straight edge razor shaves too, those are awesome... 

I only got the haircut service, but i do believe they do full straight edge cuts, shampoo, and some other stuff. check their website out for all that they offer... Haircut is 14 dollars, 2 dollars off if it's your first time there.

They also have a punch card which is cool when small mom and pop places do that... They accept card but its a 34 cent charge. so bring cash.. When I lived in Vegas this was THE spot for sandwiches. Period. Easily the best deli in Las Vegas. Easily. There are actually a lot of imitators, Port a sub, blah blah blah. Cap's is the best. I always recommend and they never let me down. Couple of things though... Sometimes they run out of bread which I thought was kinda ghetto.  Its expensive (for a deli) and there's no space to eat. Just one long skinny wall "table". But whatever, I like the subs but also love ordering two tuna sandwiches light onion. Yum... my stomach is growling.

CLIFFNOTES: If you like subs or deli's EAT AT CAP's!
ps: I damn near wanna give them 5 stars...Almost. Do you have to have a septum ring to work at Hot Topic, or do they give you one when you get hired?  This Hot Topic is nestled in the scenic Metro Center, which I like to call "Indoor Tijuana".  But the Hot Topic isn't bad, and the employees are nice enough.. George serves up amazing Greek food. I order the gyro pita every time. 

Wish they had more seating, but this place is worth the wait!. Great place.  The food is delicious and the people watching is even better.  It can get pricey fast so just be careful on how much you are ordering.  The kinda DJ they have on the weekend nights is lame but the rest of the ambience is nice.. My initial review of Boka, was really a second review as I had let the first of two incidents pass without my disgrunteled opinion.

If I may, I would like to point out that few and far between, do you find an eatery who's owners genuinely care about the experiences of their customers and long time patrons. Mrs. Boka, immediately after I posted a negative review,  took it upon herself to get to the bottem of the issues in my complaint. Her appologies for the mishap were met with a comp and assurance that this would not happen again to me or any other customers. 

I feel and have always felt, as significant as the quality of the product, is the quality of the service and her attentiveness and persistence to follow up and assure my satisfaction are rare and I appreciate it. Thanks again guys for making it right. Oh... And I came to find out Yelps delivery service were the ones who delayed my refund not Boka.. We ordered wings, pizza and garlic knots. Everything was very good! The bbq on the wings was a bit sweet and tangy... Different but good! The knots were hot and pull apart soft. Would recommend.. Wow I never knew I was passing this up every time someone offered to come here. I have ALWAYS heard of this place and never gave it a chance. I came here for business lunch trip and fell in love !

Unlimited salad options (wish there would be chicken though ) but all the toppings and different types of fresh lettuce. Also if your in the mood for hot fresh soups they have that too! Pizza and pastas available as well.

For a fresh healthy alternative to fast food , this place is welcome to my diet... We love the Smelly Cat! The antique rustic atmosphere is very hip and the employees are extremely helpful. We tried there version of a frap and loved it. Once weekly we drive forty five minutes to the cat house and find it very relaxing.. Love the look old dinner style.
This place is good, I always saw this place when driving and decided to give it a try and it was worth it. The burgers are simple and delicious.

They have a different types of burgers and other food.

Will definitely come back in the future. Found another Vegan spot to eat at in Vegas. Food is great. Join the Vegan revolution! Being healthy is the new gangsta!. I probably need to try one more time to be sure, could be a fiver.  I had the grand plateau at 110, my wife was not very hungry so i more or less ate a whole small ocean: one lobster, some crab, most of 8 shrimp and 16 oysters (five kinds), all of 8 clams and 9 mussels. yum! had a very nice soupe du jour, a gazpacho perfect for the mid 90s heat (dined sat 5.30.09) and a salade marachere au chevre chaud (mixed greens, red wine vinaigrette, warm goat cheese & herbes de provence. 11$) yum again! wife ordered the frites, okay but not to her favored Cesar standards. i had a few. Had a nice (sorry forgot name) french chardonnay, moderately priced (low 50s). Lagniappe was a fine Belgian beer list and I enjoyed a Piraat, an old standby, to close.  I wanted so much to try the special sea bass i think w/ jalapeno butter sauce? but wife wanted the Grand Plateau so I went Grande!   The salmon the trout and the salmon rillettes would have been other good calls.  Try it, you'll like it! Service wise: two kudos one for our waiter recommending I try Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay for beer (I will review that soon) and another for him going to check the b-ball score while we ate as I'd wisely wagered on the Magic to knock the Cavs out.. STK 2013

Ninja stomach silent but hungry.

Order: Soba Noodles, Side Curry, Small Salad, Side Vegetables

Entree: Soba

Culinary Thought: I enjoyed this, all while applying a not-so known noisy ninja noodle-noshing technique .  Whilst consuming noodles, it is the only time for ninja to make sounds!  Also, it allows one to truly experience the essence of  soba.  Come with me sometime for a demonstration.  

Ninja Eating Plan: The season of winter was heavily upon the area at the time so it was appropriate.  I did negate the chicken provided, for this ninja is a vegetarian seeking the ultimate enlightenment. The gentle mix of gomashio (Japanese black and white salt granules) and shichimi (Japanese 7 spice pepper) nicely accompanied the broth but I do wish it was hotter due to my extensive ninja warrior training in the cold.  The noodles were the star of the dish, with the spinach playing a strong second shamisen.

Dessert: Chocolate Cake

Culinary Thought:  Normally ninja pass on dessert.  Tokyo Express is an exception to that ninja rule.  They KNOW dessert.


Gotten better since last time but I am eager to discover if it is even better now in 2013!  Happy New Year Tokyo Express!

P.S. I will return before the first blossoms of Spring after extensive ninja mountain training.  Itadakimasu!!!!!!!. Had 2 rolls sushi rolls. They were made right in front of us.
It was so cool to see the skill in making them.
Very tasty, hit the spot.

Mahalo :). As you walk inside The Albanch, it's just plain cool. Period. The warm wood walls and the spacious bar and the cozy nooks in the back felt immediately welcoming. Our sever greeted us and took us to a table along the large windows facing Cockburn Street. The old world views of the alleys out the back definitely felt very Edinburgh. 

At first glance, I was having trouble deciding on what to order. Nothing seemed to pop out at me and I wasn't sure I was even feeling "pub fare". However, as our waitress walked up, I suddenly eyed the "Mull of Kintyre Macaroni". We asked the waitress what her favorite items were and she suggested the Balmoral Chiceken or the Mull of Kintyre Macaroni. So that's what we went with. Boy, we were glad that's what we picked! Everything was fantastic. I scarfed up every bite of the goeey macaroni goodness.

The service was fantastic and we really enjoyed our server. She was friendly and conversational. It was a great last meal for our visit to Edinburgh. We definitely wanted to stay longer in Edinburgh and The Albanach only added to our desire to stay in Edinburgh. Loved it!. I had a wonderful stay this past week. Very friendly and helpful staff. VERY comfortable and very easy walk to CMU and eating places in Shadyside 

I will make this my base in Pittsburgh. VCA is a great place to bring your pets! We just adopted a new kitten and took him to McCormick Ranch to get his vaccine shots and the staff was so friendly and helpful. Really great people there.. Cali burrito is a must have.... We keep coming  back. Love the food and the crew.

Best Pizza Gilbert, Arizona - Sal's Gilbert Pizza: https://youtu.be/56hCXkkT5-s. Been here twice now. Think I have sampled a bit of everything. Tried three different kind of tacos (chicken, beef, and fish), a burro (carne asada), and a quesadilla (ground beef). Everything was really good. 

The quesadilla is quite a bit different then other quesadillas I have had. Much thicker. More like a stuffed gordita. Was really good.

Small place. No wait was I was there, but I can easily see there being one. Salsa bar is fantastic.. My bike ride on 8/3 ended up with a rear flat tire.  I watched some YouTube videos and decided I could fix it myself.  Went to Machinery Row Bicycles and bought a tube.  I did a nice job with the flat, but messed up my rear brakes (rookie mistake).  Took my bike in on 8/4 and explained my situation.  The repairman put my bike in the air and fixed it within minutes.  He had the proper tools and experience.  He didn't charge me anything.  Could it have been my Yelp bell he noticed (thanks for the Yelp schwag Corey!)?  Regardless, I was very happy, thankful, and put some love in the tip jar.. I stopped in for a late night drink right before they closed on a Tuesday night. It was a fair price for the High West Whiskey, but what really made my night was how Tabby and Kat made me feel welcome even though they were closing. They had plenty of time to spend with me and ask about my night. I'm a bar manager at a nice place right down the street, so I can really appreciate their late night service and the time they speny with me. Thanks!!!. Dear reader, 
I submit to you this humble comparison of two Gyro joints that sit within spitting distance of each other. But it's more profound than just bragging rights for the best Gyro, this is also a tale of Yelp vs. local word of mouth. You see, I was challenged by a friend not 30 minutes before on the quality of Yelp reviews vs. WOM. 

So I'm getting a ride from a local (thanks Bernie!) to the South Side, and he points out a Gyro joint as being the best in P'burg (Mike and Tony's) and then I see just across the corner another Gyro joint I recognized from Yelp reviews as having 4.5 stars. So it hits me. Let's put his tithe test. 

I asked to be dropped off, pull up Yelp and check reviews. Sure enough, my WOM rec, Mike and Tony's has only 4 stars, and Lesvos has 4.5. I see my opportunity to test local WOm vs. Yelp right then and there (and eat two Gyros instead of one!)

I won't belabor the results:

Mike and Tony's was a better experience for me, thought neither was perfect. 

M&T's - 4 stars
Lesvos - 3 stars

Now, keep in mind this is based on one visit, Gyro to Gyro. Sampling method is not perfect since there was a few minutes between eating each, and Mike and Tony's likely has an advantage since I was more hungry when I ate theirs (although I only ate half to try to control for this).  Here are some details:

M&T - total hole in the wall, but not in a bad way. Gyro came in seconds to my table, piping hot and absolutely piled with meat. It was juicy, and the pita had just the right amount of resistance. The meat was just a tad over seasoned, as another reviewer mentioned, but really food flavor overall. The tatziki sauce tasted like straight sour cream to me, with similar texture. It wasn't bad, but I prefer something a little mote delicate, with some lemon, cucumber, and a bit of yogurt tang. Overall, pretty freaking tasty. 

Lesvos - also pretty good ( and same price BTW), but just missing on a couple of things. The meat was a little dry, and though tasty, not quite as tasty. There was less meat although still a generous portion. The sauce was a tad more delicate, though still mostly tasting like sour cream. The bread was not bad, but just a tad more presence than ideal for perfect balance - a little too thick and chewy. 

Moral of the story? Not exactly sure, but if I had gone by Yelp alone, I would have missed out on the better Gyro just next door.. One of my best stays so far in las vegas. LINQ Hotel formerly known as Imperial Palace has really step up there game with the newly remodeled rooms. There many bad things to say about the place from other people but personally this place is amazing. 

Heres some advice. .
First if your heading out early make sure you check your email and check-in to room early because it really sucks waiting in that long line to check-in. It took me less then 10 minutes.

Next please don't complain about the parking lot, its a really old hotel. I wish it was broken down and replace, But nothing can be done. Yes the parking garage is so tight and with very very narrow turns. I took a truck the very first time and it was a bad mistake. After my next 5 vist i took a compact car which i suggest and park in higher floors.

Finally try the to get a room so low that it is close to the pool you wont be able to sleep with the loud music being played ....

I love stay here cuz of how close everything is and the awesome restaurant they have right between flamingo and the linq. Overall i been here so many times with a cheap price tag on room, and great modern look for each room i will recommend this place to any one.. This place is really quirky, but awesome if you get to know it. It's Beatles themed, and the menu is goofy, but the fried cheese curds are fantastic, as is the jalapeno popper burger. The turkey swiss and slaw sandwich is also a winner.

If you really want a great experience, go on a Tuesday night and play trivia. Kim, the trivia reader, is hilarious, and the waitstaff are super sweet and really friendly. They have a decent beer selection. Really, really, really good fried rice.  The other menu items are also good, but I mainly like this place for the phenomenal fried rice.  :-). My wife and I are pescatarian, so no meat.  Merkato has a delicious vegetarian sampler for $10 that fill both of us up.  The flavors are more pronounced than at other Ethiopian places, which is good.  I'm told they have excellent meat and fish dishes, too.
One star downgrade due to the place doesn't look that clean, and the wait staff can be slow to serve non-native customers.  But we've been here several times, and do love the food, and the value is amazing.. I gave Main Street Station's buffet 5 stars because of the price.
Compared to other buffets in Vegas, not only is the food good, but for that price it gets rated 1 star better.
Not going into much details here as its just good. Have tried other buffets in Old Town, but even some of the locals say to go to Main Street Station! 
One thing we noticed was that they charged a different price every day or just about because the menu changed daily.. Elephant Bar is a place we used to frequent for work meetings and although the food is decent, I never understood the interest in this place. In a city with a ton of diverse dining options, this would not be my first choice but it is definitely decent. Pricey but edible.. Well, I guess the Yelp peeps has got it right again! Not only yelp said it ... Zagat and Michelin said so too. Once I saw the signs, I was like .... this will be a good dinner. 

We ordered the fresh spring roll for appetizer, crab fried rice, mixed veggies with beef, and spicy basil with pork in "medium" spiciness. The appetizer was an interesting combination of chinese sausage, cucumber, and fish cake(?) - the taste with the sauce was interesting to say the least. It is worth a try if you don't want that fried stuff once in a while. The crab fried rice was one of the best I had, the price is very reasonable for the amount of fried rice we all had. The veggie beef was tasty and the beef wasn't too chewy IMO, and the spicy  basil pork, though was spicy, the taste was there and it was PERFECT with white rice. Yes we got white rice on top of the generous portion. Too bad that our hotel has no fridge nor microwave ....... we could not bring it back.

IF I wanna eat Thai in Vegas, we will be here again. Javier's  restaurant has some of the best Mexican food the strip has to offer. The staff is extremely friendly,  and will go out of their way to make your experience enjoyable!. Best donuts I have had in Vegas.  At work we always love when someone brings in the pink Box from Ronald's.. Service was great! 
Food great as well.
Ken in particular was extremely helpful with picking new items to try.
Great breakfast/brunch spot, and even though it's crowded, the wait isn't too trifling.. the chorizo stuffed mushrooms are a must and the staff is always friendly.. Resto d'ambiance familiale avec des pizzas classiques d'Italie et aussi des recettes créatives du chef Stefano et de chefs invités.. Went here for dinner without a car wash. Full rack of ribs slathered in sauce with two sides (I chose coleslaw and fries). The meat was moist and came easily off the bone. It was certainly not the best ribs I've ever had, but solid nonetheless. The sides were average.

It's an interesting little eating space on the inside. Certainly not charming, but not without its own eclectic character.

Our servers were attentive and nice, although I felt a bit rushed by them at the end of the meal.

We did a quick walkthrough after the meal and scanned high end gas station fare with plenty of kitschiness and some Restoration Hardware furniture for lounging. Not your average place whether you are getting gas, a car wash, leopard print steering wheel covers, a beverage to go, a brisket, etc., etc.. Went to Sushi Way last night for the first last night and am so glad I did.  Everything was fresh and tasty, the menu was overwelming even to a veteren ayce sushi diner.  So many rolls sounded so good I wish I could have tried more, but I did manage to try the Big Easy, sweet 16, spider roll, hamichi, salmon belly and super white tuna with jalapeño(chef special that day).  The list of appetizers was extensive as well.  The bacon wrapped scallops and kamakazi dynamite were recommended by our chef/owner, who was very friendly and was ready and willing to keep our sushi flowing.  I live in Reno and only get down to Vegas 4 to 5 times a year,  I cant wait to come back and try some more menu items.  I highly recommend having dinner here SO GOOD!. Amazing steak!!! I can say at this point of my life it was the best steak I have ever had. Nice quiet spot with great service and food. Highly recommend you check it out.. Here's what I know...

I went for a happy hour, and got a pint of beer, wings and mozzarella sticks for $12. 

No pretentious people allowed here, so it had that going for it. It's almost a dive bar, almost a sports bar, but definitely a great spot to meet a friend or 12 for happy hour and to catch up without a huge crowd or crappy bartenders. 

I love places like Brass Rail and wish I had one right down the street from my house.. This is Charlotte's best kept secret!!! 

The food is absolutly delicious. With a huge menu (almost to big lol) the Cooks really have a great personal touch.. my gf and I went in to eat and she asked the server for dinner not on the menu. Not only did they go above and beyond with the customer satisfaction but  mellow mood of a nice hang out cozy bar "like back home" def made me want to come back.

We also had a few drinks and the Bartender actually made us a couple shots. Although the name of the shot is a little out there I will be back to try another "Duck Fart" for sure lol. 

The best part is the bar also owns Palones the pizza restaraunt next door. I see myself with a few buddies  having a few beers and eating pizza while watching March madness basketball very soon......!!!!!

I recommend this place to EVERYONE... even if you have kids there is mulitple games and a pool table to play. They even have a 100inch screen that hooks up with a Wii for fun bar games and entertainment!!!. Unbelievable selection of flavors (almost intimidating to shop for because of the huge selection!) Owners always take care of me. They carry a nice high end amount of product. I'll be entering the more pro stages of vaping definitely with these guys. Great looking store!. Have been multiple times and the food is always good. I really like the seaweed rice. The Kahlua pork is also really good.. I traveled to AZ for a soccer tournament and we needed to cater a meal for three of the teams which were staying at a nearby restaurant.  I found Crust Restaurant and communicated with Mike & Mitch (the two partners) about our meal and needs and they were very accomodating.    The size of our group was originally going to be about 70 people and the amount of food provided was plenty for what ended up being closer to 80 and a BIG hit for the families traveling with us.

The process was so convenient that we called back the next night on short notice and ordered 10 large pizza's hoping he would be able to help us out again and again the service and accomodations they made were beyond expectations.  The pizza were another hit with the families.

I will definitely keep these guys in mind next time we head out to the Scottsdale/Phoenix area.  Thanks Guys!. Rick saved my spa and brought it back to life after 7 years of being down, he was  quick, knowledgeable and very reasonable. I would definitely call him again for any repair or upgrades to my spa.. Good food as usual! Great price too.

The seating is a little cramped - the table are on top of each other.. Best shrimp cocktails in  north las Vegas! They are prepared fresh and spicy.and there opened 24hrs so anytime I have a craving I can stop by and grab one.. A fabulous meal, exquisitely prepared, and served by courteous and attentive wait staff is what you can look forward to at Santé.  Owners Veronica and Chef Adam Reed are welcoming and wonderful hosts.  Chef Reed's mastery of French style cuisine is evident in each carefully constructed and well balanced dish that comes out of his kitchen.  This experience is not to be missed and is a true local gem in the heart of downtown Matthews.. This actually is a real deli, thus the prices are high, but in a way you get what you pay for. These are real deli sandwiches, piled high with good quality meat.  We had breakfast and everyone enjoyed their meal.  I had the cheese blintzes, and they were some of the best I've had.  This Jewish boy from Los Angeles never had them deep fried.  They were so lightly deep fried, and they kept their crisp.  Very delicious.  Overall, I enjoyed and would return if I stay at The Mirage again.. All the other reviews cover the details.
Management should think about getting some less disgruntled evening managers however....... The entrees looked delicious but I got distracted with several of the smaller plates: stuffed mushrooms, risotto, mussels, and the pastry/chocolate dessert.  All were excellent and beyond reproach.  The stuffed mushrooms were particularly delightful, particularly with the house-made sauce.

The service was fantastic, and a special mention must go to Wayne, the new bartender.  His Mai Thai puts anything else to shame.  Even for those who aren't big into sweet drinks, this is perfect.  Smooth, sweet, strong, and garnished with a fantastic dark marashino cherry. Apparently that Mai Thai has won awards, and they're well deserved.  It was fantastic!. Windows is a relatively tiny, newly renovated showroom on the second floor of Bally's Las Vegas. The name must be obviously attributed to the floor-to-ceiling, West-facing windows with a surprisingly beautiful, unobstructed view of the Las Vegas strip. 

Windows is quite a hidden gem featuring some very low-key shows, one which happens to be a most excellent show recently relocated from Plaza Hotel downtown: The Phat Pack (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-phat-pack-las-vegas).

Residencies
Some other shows, in addition to The Phat Pack. also calling Windows home are the following: 
*Dancing Just Like the Stars!
*Paranormal: http://www.yelp.com/biz/paranormal-las-vegas
*Rocky Horror Picture Show
*Tony and Tina's Wedding: http://www.yelp.com/biz/tony-and-tinas-wedding-las-vegas

Box Office
The box office for this showroom is located on the first floor near Signatures gift shop. They also keep a lists for certain will calls -- at least for The Phat Pack -- at the maitre d' stand near the bar. 

Lines of Sight
Seating is properly designed so that the chairs are already naturally parallel with the stage, unlike at other showrooms (including the Plaza's), where one may be seated looking to the 3 o'clock, or 9 o'clock, in relation to the stage, instead of a more useful, head-on twelve. 

Epilogue
Windows is a nice space with a really professional staff, and competent enough box office. What truly lets Windows shine as a showroom is the recent investment in the soundsystem and flat screens. "I'm a fan." - E. I think this is the best casual pizza option around. I don't even see the comparison to Glass Nickel, but maybe I've just had bad experiences there, food and service-wise. 

You can't go wrong with the Roman Candle menu item itself -- great pizza! The vibe is chill Willy St and the service is more quirky than anything, though I guess I can see how people have had bad experiences. (Sometimes they take away my fork after the appetizer.) Just be proactive if your server does something silly or you need their attention. It's part of the charm. I love the place, so I'm more willing to be forgiving, I guess. Keep that good pizza coming.. I discovered Thai Lotus through grubhub and Eat24 (their preferred method of delivery). Each time I ordered the food was hotvand delicious. I can not tell you how many of their dishes I have ordered but I can tell you that the curries are SPICY and that I have not had a bad dish yet. As of a few days ago delivery had been my preferred way of enjoying all of their wonderful dishes.  I happened to be in the area and decided to bring my roomie there for lunch. She is glad I did and so are her husband and son. After the first stop for lunch, we had to make another one the following day. The only negatives I or my roomies have come across is that the sweet and sour chicken was tooooo sweeet on the second visit and that they serve their pepsi products from cans rather than soda fountains which can make for flat sodas.  I love this place and will until I find somewhere better. The staff is always ready to serve you hand and foot as well, gotta love being taken care of like a king!. I am only reviewing the spicy chicken wings, simply the best I have ever had.  This is a very simple mom & pop restaurant that delivers.
The wings would have been five stars at double the price and at $4.95
a steal.  This is the real deal, the cliental was almost all Asian which is
a validation in itself. It will be the best $4.95 food you have every eaten!. Super-duper huge multi-story record store! The staff member that helped me out was amazing, a song was playing in French on the overhead sound system that I decided I liked & after I told him just a few words of the song, he located the CD for me!

Good discount CD section too -- I found the few years old British Now 52 for $4.99!. This place is the bomb!  Not too crowded yet and still the freshest fish on this side of town. Taste sushi at the AYCE places then come here. You an taste the difference!!. I really like Panda express. Some of their dishes have 450 to 500 calories per serving, but others have a much healthier alternative. Chicken with green beans, mushroom chicken, teriyaki chicken have 250 calories. Substitute your noodles or rice for steamed veggies or half of veggies and half another choice.

This particular place has quick service, the place is clean and the flavors are reliable. One of my favorite fast food places.

Jocelyn was the person helping us and she was bubbly, happy, talkative and was really great to deal with. A+ for her service!

Parking can be hard to find since it's on the boulevard and in a busy area, but most people are walking in this area.. I love Bachi Healthy Life kitchen! The eggs Benedict is like no other with their homemade hollandaise sauce. It's something I would recommend to anyone. Also the homemade jams made inside the restaurant are to die for. Make sure to check it out sometime, it'll change the way you look at a healthy life kitchen.. Note: I only give out 5 stars to surprisingly EXCEPTIONAL, best-in-class establishments.

This "man store" has it all, well, most of it.  It has anything related to fishing & hunting.  Prices are good & reasonable, but sure, there might be a deal or two out there that's cheaper via the internet.  This location reminds me of a cross between an outdoor sports store, a boat dealership, the Food Network and Disneyland... except for men.  

To possibly receive a 5-star rating: 
1. The tactical gear/clothing section could use a little work.  I know Bass Pro Shops is more geared for outdoor sports, but  since you carry a tactical gear section, it should be the best if that's what you're aiming to be.  
2. Add a fee-based indoor shooting range.  It's a good way for you to bring in extra $$ while also keeping people around to buy your stuff.  Plus, it makes sense since you sell firearms, ammunition, accessories and targets.  
3. Expand your horizons/knowledge of outdoor recreational activities.  Include things like climbing gear (think REI).  You could really do some damage if your company merged with REI or at least took some pages out of their book.  
4. Offer a loyalty-based "annual dividend"/discount program like the one REI has.  Combined with their legendary customer service and return program, they're my #1 go-to place for outdoor equipment.  You're missing out.
5. Some of the gear you offer is for amateur cheapskates.  Offer some higher-end products.  Take a look at the lifejacket/PFD department, for instance.  All that stuff sucks, and is only for someone who is either really cheap or doesn't care about what they're buying.  On that note, the swimming goggle section sucks, too.  I was there to check out some Columbia shirts, then decided to look around for other things.  Since I was looking for some good swimming goggles, I stopped by that section, but quickly left when I realized that it sucks.  Again, you're missing out on sales.. First time here, I have heard about this place for years and it didn't dissapoint. I will definitely be making this a regular stop of mine . affordable and great service!!!. This place was awesome....seated very quickly.no waiting. Sonny our cook was friendly and funny.
I did a sake bomb and the made a 7up with syrup for my son(non alcoholic). My 3year old cried during the fire parts. But had a great time. The food taste soooo goood. We will make sure we come again and again.. Grabbed some take-out on my way home today... got a foot-long French Dip (which at this place is kinda like a Philly, but without onions or peppers) and some chips... would've got some fries, but i didn't want to risk them losing their crisp on the way home.

First off, this location has been a few other restaurants over the last few years, and I liked all of them - which on one hand is great because it's so close, but on the other hand is a bummer because it's a bit of a hidden spot so I guess in the past these restaurants didn't get enough business to stay open. Hopefully that won't be the case here. 

Had a chat with the guys working there, and it turns out the place is run by locals who grew up here like I did. We talked about the old days of Video Roundup and other stuff in the area that isn't around anymore. They seem like great guys, so I hope this place does well.

Anyway - I almost couldn't keep myself from attacking the bag on my way home as the smells coming from the container and filling up my car were intoxicating - also I was starving. When I got it home and tore it open, I was faced with two beautiful giant sandwiches... Holy shit. The bread was a 12" roll which ended up getting cut in half, but each half was stuffed with enough meat to probably fill the whole roll.

Challenge accepted.

I was pretty full after the first half, but I powered down the second half... but I didn't quite finish off the bag of chips... full-size bag by the way. Usually places give you tiny snack size bags, but they gave me a big grab size or whatever it is. Anyway - not only was it a ton of food, but it was awesome as well. Every bite was joy. I'm totally ordering from them again... and again... and again. They deliver, so I'm pretty excited about that. Even though they're like walking distance from me, I just like being able to summon food.. I can't knock it for anything.  My fish tacos where awesome and the décor is cool and nautical.  Our waitress Tabitha was attentive, on point, and friendly.  The music was great and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  I highly recommend eating here or just having a drink to soak in the atmosphere.  Soooo COOL!. I have a million things I need to do today but they are ALL on hold so I can write about how awesome this place is. They are not even fully up and running (Grand Opening is 9 July, folks) and they've already won me over. Why?

Their Espresso is at the top of my list. It is very well balanced: not too weak, not too bold, not too bitter and a really pleasant aftertaste that makes for a well-rounded consumption of coffee. Maybe my response was psychosomatic but it really took me back to Europe for a moment.

I read about their beignets and the reports are not exaggerated. They are fried up perfectly light and just a tad crispy. As much as I love donuts this was such a step up I don't know if I can ever go back. 

So my first visit here was like a mini-vacation to France and I feel like I got back a little joie de vivre. There was a bit of a wait to get my order but the folks took my coffee order while I was in line and I got to start savouring before I put in my pastry order so props for being mindful of the customers and doing their best to look after us. Since the beignets are made to order, it is worth the wait....trust me.

They also have some tasty looking gelato and their cooler already had some deli foods like olives and cheese (I need to come back soon to pick up some parmesan). I can only imagine what awesome goodies they're going to have. Once they get their liquor license we can look forward to French wine and craft beer for sale. They also have fresh flowers for sale. How awesome will you be when you bring home some fresh flowers and a bottle of wine and some cheese? Oui, oui!

The inside is very pleasant and has a nice European feel  with white walls and French Country décor. I had a chance to chat with the owner's wife and they are really great people so this is a great new business that is well worth patronizing. I think it is a great concept and am so happy that we have this in Phoenix. It is dangerously close to where I live so I could very soon turn into a beignet whore-consider yourself warned!

Parking is a bit of an issue and after going around the block twice I had to park across the street and walk in the 115 degree heat....but it was worth it. I do hope that they find reason to open earlier during the week in the future because I would be in for coffee every day on the way to work.

Really great place run by good people. Well worth checking out and I can't wait to see how much more I love them when they are completely up and running!. Great source for excellent  produce! I shop here for my produce on a weekly basis as its better priced than Walmart or Smiths and the produce is in another league quality wise.  Staff are very helpful and I love the layout and cleanliness of the store.  Highly recommend and hope this chain is successful.. I hate the freaking sun and that it beats down my house all the time.  Thanks CC, I don't have that problem any more, I have a lower power bill too. Holly crap CC I think I'm in love.. I had not heard of this independent coffee house until our Yelp Book Club decided to have their discussion there.  This is a super place!

I ordered the Caribbean Colada smoothie.  The gentleman at the register told me it had everything but the rum.  On a 113 degree day in Las Vegas, this was just the ticket for a refreshing, evening drink while discussing our book.  The coconut and pineapple flavors were excellent!  It was an outstanding drink!!

The room has many tables for laptop use and there is free wifi.  The music was playing at a volume which was enough to hear it and enjoy it without it intruding on speaking with my group.  

I have checked Grouchy John's website and their mobile unit will be near where I live this Friday.  Great!  I can patronize them without the drive.

See you Friday, Grouchy!. THE place to go in Scottsdale to find people who aren't out to be seen.  This place is 1500 square feet and it s always packed on the weekends. The house band plays Thurs, Fri and Sat and with no cover charge at the door, this is one smokin' deal.  Only warning is stay with bottle beer--the mixed drinks are more mix than drink.. I am like a Yoyo!  I started coming to this place but at the other location and stopped for a year.  I recently came back and joined up at this St. Rose Location closer to my house and here is the deal:

a.  Trainer - I really like the electronic user friendly training system that keeps you on target. I do not enjoy personal trainers, so a machine trainer is the next best thing.

b.  Cardio - 2 elliptical and 3 walking machines. Just the right amount and having the headphone with the programmed training choices is great.  Keeps you focused, burns max calories and love that it is 15 minutes!

c.  Strength - 5 machines in all, never had to wait and at the hours I come, usually I am alone or with one or two others.  30 minutes strength test with the machine trainer measuring your timing and all works for me. 

d.  Your USB - You keep all your data on your USB drive and plug it into either the cardio or strength machines. All is tracked and you can visit your own website for your updates.

e.  Staff and Owners - The staff and owners of Koko Fit are absolutely great and make coming here part of the fun. While I do not see them often as I like to come early morning, I know that they are always supporting me.

This is great gym, comfortable, just right and perfect for my habits!

GK says, check it out.. We came out to Phoenix for a little spring training action and a good friend of mine was twisting my arm to give this place a shot.  We finally made it on our way to the airport on our last day and I'm pumped we did.

We started with margaritas, which are out of control.  They are the perfect combination of sweet and citrus.  Truly some of the best margaritas I've had at any restaurant or bar.

For dinner we got the Chicken Fried Steak with fries and the Prime Rib with mashed potatoes.  The steak was good, it didn't have a ton of flavor but the gravy that I slathered on top did.  The Prime Rib was awesome, thick, red, and juicy.  They even brought us out some sour cream because they didn't have horseradish sauce.

Good stuff, I really liked their gravy.. Hotel very nice down side the had contraction going over this weekend not to good overall y will came back to this hotel other the price. After being unhappy with a few other cleaners when we moved here, we finally found this place and have been going here ever since!  They're awesome, Mike and Vivian treat you like family and it's always a pleasure to see them.  The quality of service is always great and consistent.  Highly recommended.. Very delicious.  Had chicken arepas, rice and beans, and plantains.  Arepas and plantains were delicious.  The beans weren't quite as good as I expected - but I am most familiar with Cuban black beans, so maybe that accounts for the difference.

I would definitely return and think you should give them a try!

Oh, also, the LEFT menu is in English, the right in Spanish.  Don't stare at the wrong one for several minutes like a dumbass like me.  :-). I had the Steak Freitas and Green Beans dish and it was excellent. Came here for dinner and drinks on New Years Eve and was impressed with the service and overall environment. They have a great draft beer selection as well to compliment their dinner menu. I would recommend this place looking for a good dinner and a beer close to the square.. Beat sushi I have ever tasted. $25 all you can eat sushi. Great food and drinks.. Big portions (if you're sitting for 2 best to share), the only thing I couldn't get over was you couldn't get a side of hash browns. The place is named hash house.. Service was friendly, there was a half hour wait at about 11am to keep in mind. Had the chicken and waffles, everything cooked to perfection, chicken was juicy a bit more spice would have taken it over.. This place is always packed.  Food is great, price is cheap, service is great.  Every 30 minutes, the staff do a line dance which is pretty entertaining.  Prime Rib here is the best!  16 oz for 20 bucks.  Can't beat that!  Unfortunately, you have to come early enough otherwise prime rib runs out.. I have been going to this Safeway for about 5 years now.  The staff is super friendly and always very accommodating.  I hate grocery shopping, but the friendly attitude make for a great experience.. I love this place. Your led downstaris into an old jali house where you dine inside of a cell. This place is a gem. Food is not the best but def price appropriate but the ambiance is one of a kind.. What a delight! Came into town for the weekend. My scap started to ache and I found this oasis. The location is top notch. As an LA resident and massage aficionado, I've seen some very nice places. Suzanne, new to the salon, handled me brilliantly. She was immediately attuned with my body and energy. Her touch was fabulous. And most importantly, my pain vanished.  And on top of all that, she referred me to a vegan restaurant nearby that was a delicious stop for brunch, Pomegranate. All in all, I'd say this was certainly a 5-star experience. Suzanne, your roster should be full in no time. Thanks!. So I have worked in the catering industry for 6 years. Which means I work many weddings. Which are droll and predictable at best. As are the cakes. I despise Tammy Coe for her fondant cakes that are blissfully boring yet so cute (why can't I use italics for cute). Many others have little flavor or are repeating an idea that was authored by betty crocker generations ago.

This is where Honey Moon is different. Fresh fruit on top. Shaved icing on top in a simple and unpretentious manner. Moist but not disintegrating as you cut into it. Light yet flavorful. Good website. Free coffee. By far this is the only cake that I will steal from a wedding party for a taste. Everything else is fodder.. After being told by some coworkers that I should try this place. I went ahead and did that. We were seated immediately. There are so many options for your pancakes and everything looks delicious. I finally decided on the cookie butter French toast. It was good but nothing to brag about. I ordered some eggs, bacon and potatoes and they were all so good. Can't wait to go back and try the different items on the menu. I gave them 4 stars because there was an inconvenience regarding upgrading the French toast from regular to cookie butter filled. Either way the service was good.. First time here and it was great. The service was good and the food was awesome. I got the kabob plate with an assortment of meat and rice. It was very tender and seasoned well. Their fries are even good!. As a man from MA one bite and I am home. The food was excellent. It far exceeded our expectations. The service was friendly and attentive. Recommend it for something different.. The new location is awesome.  Expanded taproom and a good little outdoor space this place has brightened up this part of Charlotte.  You will find some of the best beer in CLT here and the owners Suzie and Todd are plain awesome!. DROP EVERYTHING!! MAKE NEW PLANS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT!!  Canteen Modern Tequila Bar is ready to open Thursday. Wife and I were lucky enough to snag a special invite last night from owner Julian Wright, and glad we did. Soft "training" opening with a simple menu, but simple done well is still DELICIOUS! Clean decor, with cozy padded seating, plenty of wood, rainbow mosaic tile, and a mix of sleek and rusted steel to balance it all. (Sorry no pics!) They may still tweak the menu, but our samples were mini tacos piled high with shredded pork, cheese, cilantro, and I think, guacamole spread. Spare ribs too, meaty, not too fat, with a hint of sweet. And the simple chicken wing, but big ones, also meaty, grilled with the perfect char. A great house margarita too, thanks to bartenders Clint & Dulia. We are downtown Tempe regulars and are sure to return this weekend. Loved it! I would have gone 5 stars but I am sure their best is coming......... Don't be fooled by its location in a tiny strip mall. This is an amazing Mediterranean restaurant at a very reasonable price. The shawerma fries were A-M-A-Z-I-N-G, but be aware, the portion is very large so prep your appetite! Their pitas are freshly baked and hummus home made, so that is another must have when you go there.

It may be a tad bit quiet on the weekdays for lunch but believe me they don't skimp on the quality even when there are not as many customers. This place is a hidden treasure and deserves to be discovered by all those who loves good Mediterranean food.. I was treated by the owner David like a king
It's was a good experience overall!
I will definitely go back again!!!. The food here is always good, especially the beef on wick.  Hopefully it is getting back on the menu as us Western NY'ers don't have many options for this back home favorite. Beer selection is great and everything is reasonable priced.. What am I gonna say..... IT'S THE BELLAGIO MAN!!!

This place is swank, glitz, glamour, amazement up the wazoo!!!  If you've never been here, obvious recommendations are to watch the Fountain Show (every 15 min in the evening, every 30 min during the day), check out the garden near the lobby check-in (changes seasonally, so if you go on a slow time of the year, chances are they're changing it then), and the poker room.  

Bellagio has NICE rooms.  Very plush, yet firm beds.  Pool is "simple" for Vegas standards.  There are several.  Nothing overly unique.

I recommend checking out the poker room (lots of the high limit pro's you see on TV play here), the sports book is pretty awesome, and watch "O" if it's available and not sold out.  Weekend seafood buffet is good, but pricey (like $38/person). Great pizza, fun times sitting at pizza-by-the-slice bar. Just ate the deep-dish pizza by the slice!. After fours years of living here, and kept on talking about eating here. I finally had my chance! 
1st mistake, do not take your wife who hates seafood, and can not stand the smell of fish here on Fridays! It's all you can eat fish fry! After getting over the smell, she was fine.
Now I wasn't sure if this was a restaurant that serves beer? Or a bar that serves food. This place looks a lot larger from the outside, however it can still sit a lot of customers by using their outdoor patio.
Now the food!
I order the bangers and mash, I was very satisfied with this dish. Really enjoyed the sausage. Very good taste, loved the texture and seasoning. 
Our girls both had chick tenders, both liked their dishes very much. I actually tasted the tenders and I also agreed with them. Again, very good seasoning.
Wife had a cheeseburger, and after taking a bite out of it. I knew she liked it, because of the grill taste of it! She loves her charbroiled flavor. I also had to get some hot wings. The girls like to have them every time we go out. They were good, and very tasty.
Service was great, even though they were very busy for the Friday fish fry. They were able to take care of everyone without any problems.
This is definitely a place to come back to, and we will.. lumberjack slam was great , waitress gave great service , got a seat right away and coffee was very good !!!. I highly recommend Camden South End for prospective renters.  The area is great and easily accessible to Uptown Charlotte via the Light Rail or a short walk.  

Having lived at two different Camden properties in Charlotte, I enjoyed nice upgrades and amenities as well as an amazing leasing staff at both. Maintenance requests are always completed the same day and any additional issues are addressed in a timely manner.  

I'm moving out of the country, but look forward to renting again from Camden when I return to Charlotte in 2017.  Thank you Camden South End and Cotton Mills for making me feel at home for so many years.. This is one of my favorite places to hike. It's not too crowded and there are several trails to choose from.. HIdden MF'ing gem in Las Vegas.  If you have a car or are not afraid to venture off the strip for some cheap, good eats, this is the spot to go!

It was a lenten friday on our vacation, so we were on the search for some seafood.  We didn't feel like paying $30 for a buffet or eating some fried fish sandwich from a fast food joint, so one of us came up with the great idea to have some Thai food.  Yelp to the rescue!

We were about a mile from this place, and a 4.5 star average?  We can't lose.  And we definitely did not.  We started off by sharing the seafood tom yum soup, which was delicious.  It had shrimps, mussels, squid, and fish balls.  We ordered it medium, but would have definitely been ok with mild, as we were all dripping in sweat by the time we took our 2nd and 3rd bites.  For my entree, I went with the green curry with shrimp.  I wish there was more shrimp, but the food itself was very well prepared and tasted great.  

Other entrees on my table were pad thai, 5 spiced (?) salmon, and some other fried red curry salmon.  It was meat-less friday remember?  haha  All of us had nothing but positives to say about our dishes.  And, all the dishes were less than $10.  Score!

The service here is excellent as well.  Seeing our sweat soaked faces, the waitresses were quick to refill our waters and even put the fan next to us.  Lol.  I have never been anywhere that would actually do that for you.  haha

Parking is a bit weird here.  I did not see a parking lot, except for the one across the street, so we had to play frogger in Las Vegas chinatown, which was another adventure in itself.  

Overall, food is excellent and I will be back.. Good food Good service Good price
Can't go wrong with that. Awesome clinic, friendly staff, great customer service. Dog pooped out front and I asked for something to pick it up but they insisted that I not worry about it and they took care of it themselves. Got all my dogs shots here plus got her fixed and microchipped. The prices were good and they definitely took care of us as owners to make sure we were informed. They gave my dog more pain medication to take home than she needed which was a relief to have just in case. Love this place and will take my dog here so long as I live in North Las Vegas.. Recommended by our hotel, we were greeted by the valet who was kind and helpful.

We walked into a dark yet inviting restaurant where the staff was friendly and attentive.

We ordered chicken enchilada, filet in a chile relleno, and scallops.  Very good but a tad spicy for one of us.

Tip: guacamole is awesome!. I always try and get here at least once when I go to Madison.  The food is always good.  I love the tofu scramble.  A great mix of traditional diner food with some great healthy alts.. Awesome Flavors! The owner puts his all into the quality and his customers. Best froyo in Phoenix easy.. The good old  Las Vegas bar and grill, the place where the end of the work week merges into the weekend. This past Saturday, Rocky's Bar &  Grill (abbreviated Rocky's) was the bar and grill where my work week merged into my weekend. 

  Rocky's is located in the small shopping center at the southeast corner of Maryland Parkway at Windmill Lane. The locally famous Grouchy John's Coffee Shop is the landmark. 

  For a couple of years I had been parking near Rocky's when I hung out in Grouchy John's. I never stepped inside until this weekend. 

  In similar style to many bars and grills, Windows here are nonexistent. Once I stepped inside the heavy brown doors, I left the outside world for an isolated world of dining, gambling, and moderate drinking. In similar style to several bars and grills, the layout is a dimly lit restaurant separate from the smoky bar and lounge. 

  From the time I walked through the doors, I waited a few minutes to be acknowledged. The host and only waiter Roland arrived a few minutes later. He was friendly and professional. He invited me to sit anywhere. I chose a comfortable booth in a room that was sporadically populated and quiet to the degree that it is a nice place for a date or me time. The primary sounds were the hard Rock classics playing at a soft volume. 

  My mind was set on the chicken parmesan sandwich. When it came time to ordering, Roland let fall that it is a hero style sandwich that doesn't come with fries. Okay. I'd order the fish & chips. 

  The three large pieces of cod and the steak fries were tastational and filling. The portions were large to the point of Roland placing a second plate containing  bowls of tarter sauce and cole slaw. The cole slaw was out of this World. Rocky gives the knockout punch with the cole slaw. I give Rocky's kudos for including cole slaw with the fish & chips. In my opinion, fish & chips without cole slaw is like nachos without cheese. Yet, it amazes me that there are so many restaurants that just don't get it and exclude cole slaw with fish &  chips. A few restaurants that I lately reviewed that are guilty of this are Village Pub and Red Robin. This delicious cole slaw rounded up my rating from 3.5 to 4 stars. The fish &  chips with bottomless Pepsi came out to $14.47 before tipping Roland. 

  If I was still hungry, I could of ordered a homemade apple cobbler or vanilla ice cream. Subsequently to the end of the work week dinner, I  headed for the beginning of the weekend revelry in the bar/lounge. 

  The bar/lounge is a long rectangular space with sofa style chairs and a bar with monitors above showing sports and video gaming below. I played my video Keno while enjoying a $3 PBR and watching the UFC. I shared the bar and lounge with a friendly clientele. 

  Time went by fast. When I opened the heavy brown door to return to the real World I had a few thoughts lingering on the isolated World of Rocky's. As I put the thoughts to words they are that this is a good spot in the Southeast Valley to enjoy tasty fish & chips that include delicious Cole slaw before a cold one and some moderate gaming or watching a sports event. 

        I                                                                  I

My favorite is the lamb cumin, crispy, spicy, and sweet. If your looking for really good Chinese food this is place definitely will be back. The cold chicken feet and cucumber are also really good. A great selection of Bizarre Sodas (pop) and Unique Candies (candy). If you want to try something new and have a cravings for sweets, head on in. 

This is a Niche place, glad to see it doing well.. It's the crazy chicken. You know what to expect when you go here. For those who don't know what to expect, it's a Mexican/American fast food restaurant that serves some satisfying flame grilled chicken at a low price. Remember that I said fast food, so this means it can potentially come with bad service (depending on the cashier) and crazy customers. I really do like this location though. I think I come here at least 1x/every week or every other week to get a fix of my pollo bowl, overly sweetened horchata, and some bomb guacamole salsa (I seriously think this is one of the best salsas I have ever had) 

They also have some great $5 deals going on every now and then. Not to mention the coupons they constantly give you for family meals and other smaller items. They also have a "dollar" menu but they are priced starting at $1.14 for a chicken taco, flan, a piece of chicken leg (yes just the leg), churros, and other things. It's quite a value meal deal. To me, if you don't like El Pollo Loco, then maybe your palate is just too fancy or just plain wrong. I support the crazy chicken!. Reading the Metro Light Rail reviews that some Yelpers write is ridiculous. Born-n-raised Arizona folks, welcome to DECENT mass transit. Crying that the liberal, people-of-low-means are riding on the "mugger mover" that you paid taxes for is just stupid. Light rail cuts down the number of cars on the road (perhaps cars owned by low-income peeps in a bad state of repair that might crush a fender on your precious new BMW). I'm from the streets of Philadelphia, and have utilized mass transit ALL of my life. Mass transit is a melting-pot of people. If the crazy woman next to you is making you uncomfortable, turn on your iPod or surf on your G3. Light rail is great to get downtown, to the ballpark or U.S. Scareways Arena, or getting your drunk on in Tempe. It's amazing CLEAN, it's well-airconditioned, and there seems to be plenty of security. And crying that you cannot work the automated ticketing kiosks??? Really? Follow the instructions on the darn screen!! Or buy your ticket at a check cashing joint!Try to ride on the Market-Frankfort Elevated in Philly and see how much better Metro light rail is...... SMDH!!. This place used to have an Afghan lunch buffet, and when I returned to find that gone, replaced by yet another Indian place, I was disappointed initially. 

But wait! This is the most excellent Indian buffet I have tried in Phoenix. Even better than Maharaja Palace, which was my favorite before this. I have been back at least five times since, and every time the food is just awesome. They do tend to have the same chicken dishes each time I am here--not sure if that is luck of the draw or if they just do the same thing all the time. But the flavor is so great I don't care. My wife also loves the fact that they have a goat curry on the buffet. I've not seen that elsewhere. They also have tandoori chicken on the buffet, rather than bringing a couple of pieces out to your table like a lot of restaurants do. 

I need to try this place for their dinner menu. If the buffet is this good, I can only imagine how awesome the regular menu must be.

In addition to the food, the service is very good, and the place is clean (can't say the same about Maharaja Palace). 

I would put this restaurant up in the top of my overall favorite Indian places worldwide. I have had better in Hong Kong and San Francisco and Chicago, but only slightly better.. Wanted to try this place after eating Ichiza near by. It's an extremely nice and quiet restaurant with great customer service. I am not a big fan of the deep friend skewers but for those who are, I believe they would enjoy this place. I also ordered the sashimi bowl, garlic stir fried chicken gizzard and mackerel battera which were all very good. Sashimi was very fresh. Gizzard was tasty and would only recommend the mackerel battera for those who could stand the distinct fishy taste that mackerel has. Would definitely come back here again but just not for the fried skewers.. This is one of the few western New York-ish restaurants in the valley. It is also the only restaurant I know of in Phoenix that has margarita pepperoni available for their pizza. The wings are good, but I wouldn't say great. You'll have to ask for extra sauce, or they'll come out too dry. They also have a good Beef on Weck sandwich, though I always have to ask for light gravy, otherwise it'll be dripping out the sides. The French Fry's are the thin type, but taste delicious. There are some shortcomings like the menus that appear to be printed off of someone's computer, but still I'd recommend it as a good place to eat.. WOW!  Just ate at Filibertos the first time (new to AZ) and was extremely impressed.  Went through the drive-through in Gilbert and ordered the enchiladas and they were amazing. Huge portions and great, low price.  Couldn't believe it was fast food.  Highly recommended.. Hey I love me some Buffalo! Buffalo Exchange that is! Every time I stop by the Central Avenue area (when it's not midnight bar-hopping time on a Saturday) I'm sure to stop in for at least a look. For a used, vintage and lightly loved clothing store they have a great selection. As expected their choices are more geared towards women with at least 70% of the store women's clothing including a giant wall of shoes in the back. I'm almost jealous when I see the array of things for the ladies to dig through.

That touting of the women's section aside, I do like what they've got for the guys. Of course a great pick of T-shirts from all brands under the sun. In decent condition to boot! They have some nice cowboy boots and the more popular sneakers for the streets. Flannels, button-downs, polos and collared shirts plus lots of jackets and sweaters that look hand-sewn by grandma (great for the frat-boy sweater parties I imagine).

Comparing these guys to other places like Plato's Closet they are, hands-down, one of the best Charlotte's got to offer for vintage and used clothing. Also, if you're selling they do take a lot of the unusual men's stuff whereas Plato's closet wouldn't even touch a pair of men's jeans if they weren't blue. Take whatever you've got and sell here! They give you more for the trade in, more selection and overall more money in your pocket!. Love this property! It's in Beautiful Seven Hill, Henderson, NV. The grounds are beautiful and everyone is very helpful. Like anywhere you go, you are going to run into problems with maintenance and issues and of course you want things done right away. I have had a few things go wrong with my apt but for the most part they fix the problem in a timely manner of course putting emergency situations first. Travis is an incredible maintenance supervisor and is very detailed when it comes to fixing the issue. Desiree is the main property manager and is always pleasant and willing to help, she takes pride in this property and it really shows. Her position can be stressful but she always handles it with a smile. The apartments are condo style so the quality surpasses regular apartments. Granite counter tops, vaulted high  ceilings  and all the amenities of a place to call home. They are always having events in the clubhouse for the residents, pool parties, wine tastings, pizza parties, bbqs etc... It's nice to know who your neighbors are and that we live in a safe environment. I highly recommend Chateau Calais and have recommended it to friends and family. Ovation Property Management is top notch and a quality company who takes the time to give you the very best. If you are moving in to the Las Vegas/ Henderson area, give them a call and let them show you what desert living is all about. Don't get caught up in a place that you will not like, for a few extra dollars, check out Chateau Calais or any ovation property.. Great food and atmosphere. Chimichurri is addictive, especially with the empanadas. I usually get the Cuban sandwich which hasn't disappointed yet. The steaks are good as well as the Parillada combinations. That is a great experience it itself if you have a group of people. Great place to go for different reasons - a sandwich for lunch, a date night for steak/pasta or a good place to go with family and have a nice conversation over a great meal. You never feel rushed and it's a bonus that they carry Argentinian products like mate and all the accessories.. Unfortunately my stomach wasn't very happy shortly after I ordered, so I wasn't able to eat my food when it was brought to me.  But I did have my leftovers the next day, and they were pretty good.  I got a pasta dish and my girlfriend got a Chinese dish, and both were excellent.  Very strange that you order at the counter, then get served at a table, and then go back up to the counter to pay.  Would love to try it again when I can actually eat my food in the restaurant!. Excellent storage facility. Extremely clean and climate controlled so things stored stay at good temperature. They take deliveries which has been very helpful. Management helpful and friendly.. Laid out exactly like the Publix across the border in Fort Mill, this Publix is going to be improving the quality of the grocery shopping in the Southwest of Charlotte. Competing with an excellent Harris Teeter and a SuperTarget that hasn't changed in years, I look forward to the new competition here.

Excellent bakery section with loads of delicious looking sweet things. I couldn't say no to a strawberry tart and a couple of mini canolis. A fresh baguette also made it into the cart before our shop took us through the cheese department (well priced Publix brie) and then the produce section. Wow, all of it looking great. Meats? Yep, we'll take a steak. Fish? Okay, some salmon. And then filling out the rest of our shop in the grocery, dairy and frozen departments.

It's still brand new (it only opened three days ago), so yes, I expect all of the staff to be extra smiley and extra friendly. I expect the shelves to be stocked. I expect to have a happy person assisting the cashier with the bagging. And yes, I'll take some assistance bringing my groceries to the car and loading them into the trunk. Wow, Publix. I hope you keep it up. I'll be back and if the experience changes for the worse, I'll be sure to update this review.. Sitting at the bar as we speak. I always tell people how much I miss all the dive bars San Diego has to offer. Problem solved at HB Hanratty's. A dive bar after my own heart. Thanks HB!. Impress me yearly w/ beautiful arrangements, delivered on time.  I moved back to Texas a few yrs back but have been using them since they opened.  They make me look like a rock star w/ my family still in LV.  Staff is kind and professional.  Recommend!. Came to switch over to AT&T. Easy process especially with the work of Joshua Sunga. Very friendly and got the job done. No complaints going to this location.. I can't believe I've been shopping here this entire century and haven't written a review - well timed at least - this is my 100th.

First and foremost - they make their own yogurt and labneh. Secondly, the spinach and herb mixture in their spinach pies is the best this side of lower Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. Now that I think of it, several brands in here I haven't seen since Brooklyn.

Their fresh produce section is big, varied, and fresh. They butcher their own meat.  They have an excellent selection of honeys, herbs, spices, olives and flat breads. 

Best of all, on many Saturdays, I find I'm the only native English speaker in the place.. The crew here is great ! I've been dining at YC's since 2000. Now that I have children and 1 with a peanut allergy cross contamination is always on out alert when eating out, we asked the staff about any sauces or cross contamination and they helped us out.

I recommend any of the YC's Mongolian BBQ locations. This place is actually a pretty good diner, which is surprising considering its a truck stop.

I'd say that even though it's pretty similar, this Pine Cone is actually a smidge better than the one out in Johnson Creek. It's still a truck stop, mind you--the food is still greasy and hearty, but this location always seems a little bit cleaner and the servers a bit more on-the-ball. I've had messed up orders at the one in Johnson Creek, but never here.

The bakery of course, is the main draw. They have a huge variety of sweets and  they're always very delicious. I'd say for the baked goods alone they're worth checking out if you haven't been--in that respect they could easily compete with standalone bakeries.

The prices are extremely low compared to a lot of places around Madison, as well.. Woooooo beavers choice!!! We havent even had the food yet but this place is totally awesome!!!. Easy to use app and all the service providers have been excellent and have provided great work. We have used a handyman and electrician and we are happy with the price and service.. Been to this place 3 times now and it's very, very good. Just let you know, your not going for the dining exprience. Your going for the food. This place could use some updating, but everything else is good. The food is great and the service is good. I'll be going back soon........ This is the type of place that every airport needs. It has comfy seating. It has slamming tunes. And the food and drink are few notches above what is expected at an airport. Keep on, keeping on.... Rite-Aid may not be much of the store, but the pharmacy is top notch. I've had nothing but good experiences with the pharmacist there, who knows my face every time; a very friendly fellow. Even if it's a trip out of the way, I always make sure my prescriptions come from this Rite-Aid.. Incredible service and great cake! Ordered a birthday cake and it was done exactly as I had imagined.  Cake decoration is this much art as it is cooking, and I have to say they did a great job for a great price. I ordered a strawberry cake with a somewhat complex design, and the result was perfect. I also greatly appreciate the friendly service.. Sad day. The place is now permanently closed.. They are SO FRIENDLY at Petiamo!! 
Always a pleasure going in to drop off our dogs!
And the optional bandana - so cute.

Although our dogs really dislike going to the doggie beauty parlor! 
They always come home smelling fresh and clean!
Just the way we like them!. I always judge a diner by their biscuits and gravy and Sunny's Diner has amazing biscuits and gravy.

Oh, and the service was good too.. I'm a huge Gordon Ramsay fan, and this was my first trip to Las Vegas since he opened his three restaurants there. My trip wouldn't have been complete without a stop to at least one of them. 

The line at BurGR is typically 1-3 hours long. They don't take reservations, so you must stand in line and wait. On the Friday that we arrived in Las Vegas, which happened to be my birthday, we ventured down to Planet Holleywood (home of BurGR) and saw there was no line around 2PM. We immediately went in. 

If you've read any of my other reviews, you know two things about me: 1) I love burgers and 2) I'm a burger snob. I want a burger and I want it cooked perfectly. At BurGR I opted for the Hell's Kitchen burger and ordered it medium rare. I received the most delicious burger I've ever consumed. Perfectly cooked, juicy without being greasy, beautifully presented, and overall a flavor assault on my taste buds. Is that where this story ends? Absolutely not. The burger cost $14! $14 in Las Vegas. It was A La Cart, but if you compare it to a A La Cart burger place in (Bru) $14 is more than reasonable for Las Vegas. 

I will eat at BurGR again the next time I'm in Vegas, even if I have to wait 2 hours in line.. Dinette is a unique restaurant in Pittsburgh. Specializing in interesting, original pizzas which are sized perfectly for two, or one person with a big appetite. The crust is phenomenal, thin, flavorful and crispy. Personal favorite is the one that has anchovies and serrano peppers on it. They also have some interesting salads and appetizers. It is a small menu, but has something most people would like. Criticisms; not enough good beers. Beer and pizza is like peanut butter and jelly. Either one is okay but together they're great. Their wine selection is pretty good. Atmosphere is kind of quirky, not really the kind of space you'd want to linger in. That could be by design.... I have been to RA a few times and 2-3 have been at this location. My most recent meal here was incredible.

The shishito peppers are a must-have. The ponzu sauce had us tipping the empty bowl over to lick, drink, and pour on our remaining rice. It was that good.

We tried the Pacific Roll, which is essentially the experience of eating fresh mango salsa. It's not what I would call sushi, but it was tasty and refreshing. The sashimi is solid as well. The lunch combo is ~$10 and they will mix and match any 7 pieces of tuna/salmon/yellowtail you want.

This location, located in downtown Tempe on Mill Ave, is a bit more of a club/bar style than the others I've seen. They play lots of upbeat club/remix/techno music at all times of day. The service was friendly and decent.. YES to firefly!! I lived in vegas for a year, but did not discover this place until I visited this past weekend.  Great food at a great price.  Excellent sangria to start of the meal.  Then we ordered an assemblage of plates that tickled the palate to the maximum.  The best dishes of the night were bacon wrapped dates (we ordered 4 of them), the diablo shrimp (sauce was amazing), paella (juicy rice with good mixture of meat and seafood), and the fall off the bone short ribs (tender to perfection).  Overall I would definitely come back here and bring a big group to sample all the dishes!! It is definitely worth the drive off the strip!!. Lets face it, Maricopa is limited in its dinning out locations.  Say Sushi has been a haven out here in Maricopa.  The guys at the sushi bar are very friendly and make some great sushi and incredible sashimi.  Service is always quick, and the happy hour deals are awesome.  Every day from 4-7 and all day Tues, Thurs, and Sun.  I love the Tokyo, Insanity, Caterpillar, and Spicy Tuna rolls.  Plus the Eel Nigiri is very tasty.. I was looking for a company to do a repair on some carpet that a dog had physically damaged.  I called a few companies and Mr. Drane's was the most reasonable with the quote.  He was professional- calling ahead to confirm the appointment and arrived on time.  The repair was completed without a problem, and he took extra measures to ensure the repair would last.  A section of 'tack-strip' had to be replaced and he did that without extra charge.  The only issue that was a surprise was that the company only accepts cash or checks; no plastic.  So, be prepared for that. Otherwise, it was a great service and I would recommend him for carpet repairs.. This place is awesome.  Do they have 300 flavors with 600 toppings?  No.  That's probably why this place is so awesome.  I need to start out with something about the lady who was working.  I'm assuming she was an owner or someone else deeply involved in the whole process, and she was more than willing to fill us in on where the ingredients came from or any other details which she deemed necessary.  They mostly weren't necessary but when you have someone that is that into what they are doing, you gotta have some love for it.  

Between the 4 of us we probably had 12 or so samples, and we did so without a bad look or skip in the record of our servers in depth guide to the flavors.  I settled on the salted caramel ice cream, which was phenomenal.  Silky, smooth, and buttery like a kobe bryant jump shot.  Its 9AM right now and my mouth is watering thinking about it.  There are so many flavors that you just generally would never see and as weird as they may seem, they all taste great.  Next time in Scottsdale, theres a good chance I will hopefully be able to visit this hot spot (cool spot) again.. I have found that the food and customer service is always superb at Brosenbrus Cafe.  

Definitely check this place out if you are looking for awesome food.  Go today!. Eddie and his crew scheduled an appointment on Friday to have a dog door installed. He offered several suggestions for the best door for my German shepherd dog. 
He and his crew were on time and completed a perfect installation. Eddie reviews everything you need to know before leaving. He goes over the care and maintenance of the door, how to clean the flaps and training your dog to use the door. 
My door was installed completely and perfectly the first time. Dog got acclimated to the door very quickly and now has free range of the house and now the backyard. 
Eddie was very upfront with the cost of the door and the install fee. I picked the Hale door plus that he offers and I am very happy with it.

I would highly recommend puurfect pet door installers.. Food was above average but i will definately come back for the great pico de gallo salsa!. While in WI for a wedding we had occasion to stop in and grab a bite.  And it was a very good thing we did. The food was great, and the service even better.

Now, I am not a big fan of the overt birthday celebration, or the scores of waitstaff singing off key...but here, it was pretty nice to hear them do it for various patrons.  So yes, if in town on my birthday I wouldn't mind them singing for me.. Thank goodness the restaurant we WERE going to could not accommodate us that night.   I have eaten many times at Christopher's over the years and have always been delighted with the service, ambiance, and above all the food.  Justice, our server, was excellent.   We had  steamed mussels w/white wine broth, homemade ricotta and beet salad, duck thigh confit w/ duck breast cooked to perfection, and to top it off, the obligatory chocolate tower with espresso.  I can say this without reservation, this was the finest meal I have had maybe even ever.   I can not wait to go again.   Trust me, this is one place you want to try.   I would go for your next special occasion out.   For me, that may be to celebrate any given Wednesday evening that it is not over 100F out.. Think this place has undergone a few name changes over the years and this last incarnation is the best. Service is still really slow, but polite and portion size is great. Most Americans are used to being doted on whilst eating out and I'm relieved to not have someone asking how I'm doing every 30 seconds. Chicken Pad Thai was great and will definitely be going there again. Highly recommended!. It's a bit upmarket but boy, it was worth it. 
I felt a little bit under-dressed when we arrived, even though I was wearing an actual shirt. However despite not having a reservation, we were welcomed and swiftly guided to a table in the crowded dining room beside a couple of guys in jeans and T-shirts, so I stopped fretting and settled down to enjoy my cocktail aperitif. A delightful Margarita it was too.

The noise level from the other diners was quite loud making conversation difficult, and it was clear that our fellow diners were rather more advanced in their alcohol consumption, but we did our best to catch up with a lovely bottle of white wine from their extensive list. As I'm not all that familiar with the local wineries, I asked our waiter for a recommendation. Somewhat surprisingly he suggested an Italian white, but it did turn out to be delicious.

The starter of asparagus arrived in a very practical rectangular dish and contained some of the largest and most succulent asparagus shoots that I've ever tasted. Just yummy. 

We followed that with pan-roasted Digby scallops with Morel mushrooms, spinach purée and mashed potatoes. These again were just perfection, practically melting on the palate. Heaven.

It wasn't cheap, but the standard of food and the quality of the wine list certainly makes this place worth it for that special treat, and the period decor makes for a lovely romantic atmosphere.. Had some time to kill in vegas and called up the shop to see if they could fit in a walk in and they were great on the phone. Caught a cab and found a very clean cool shop nicer than any on the tv tat shows. Got a killer black and gray cross at a very good price the artist spent time to make sure to design was right and well placed. Highly recommended! Only bad thing was I had to walk a few block to catch a cab cause they take forever to get down there.. Had to go shopping for a new washer and dryer.  I could've gotten the plain jane, old school washer and dryer but we decided to go for a more efficient front loader.

I researched the best washer and dryers on the market and decided on the Samsungs.  After doing some pricing between Best Buy, home furniture stores and home improvement stores, I decided to try best buy first since their pricing was competitive.

We were lucky that the exact models I was looking for were returned/open items on the floor.  We picked these up at a good price.  I was going to do some shopping around, however I didn't have to bother as Best Buy does Price Matching for 30 days.

I saved over 40% on my new washer and dryer.  The sales, delivery and installation personnel were very professional.. Great place! Hands on staff who really show that they're trying to succeed. The owner introduced himself personally and thanked us for coming. The food is the best bar food I've ever had and the music was different than most vegas bars. Great place and I recommend that everyone try it!. I had an issue with a missing wheel lock when I had some repair work done on my Volvo.  Big O on West Sahara was the last shop to touch the tires.  I went there and explained that I was missing the wheel lock and they took care of my issue with no questions asked and best of all, no charge.  An added kicker, a free front end wheel balance.  Bought three sets of tires from this store.  If I need another set, they get the business.. Excellent food and service. Had the chicken bento box ($9) for lunch came with tons of food. Also had the green tea crime brûlée, unbelievably delicious. Will be back here soon!. Nothing more painful than trying to find a car mechanic you can trust. I've been coming to Oasis for about 3 years now and each time I've taken my car in for service, they have done a thorough job at informing me of my car's necessary repairs, but also telling me what can wait and what is more urgent. I like that approach and have never felt I've been taken advantage of. The prices have always been fair and thoroughly explained. Happy to recommend this place.. Outstanding food. Great cocktails. Every dish was outstanding.  Excellent service. Be sure to ask for their "unofficial" wine list (listing non-Arizona wines...much better selection).

Worth a visit!  Thank you FnB!!. Fantastic company to work with:  professional, creative, and passionate about what they do.  I have a nonprofit in Los Angeles and chose to work with this Las Vegas based company after doing months of research.  After meeting with Nick and his creative team for the first time, I was confident that Adlava was the best choice for the long term.  The web site exceeded my expectations and the customer service for the past couple of years has been incredible.  I am writing this review because my organization decided to update our web site recently and Nick's team developed another awesome site that exceeded expectations once again!  I highly recommend Adlava!. I walked down here to see how this casino looked and where it was. Apparently it replaced the Quad and is a huge improvement. It's a classier looking casino that features the High Roller: an enormous ferris wheel that has provides seating for a unique dining experience. The stores outside between Harrah's and the Quad is now between the Linq and the Flamingo.. Everytime I'm in downtown phoenix stopping in at nino Greek is a must for me. Yes their is a lot more Greek and Mediterranean food places around  but the homey feel at ninos Greek is second to none. The customer service that I am given Everytime I am here is the best I've seen and have received. The staff is friendly and eager to please. The food is amazing everything is made fresh. Food isn't  made until it's ordered. If you are in the area I highly recommended coming in and trying any of their plates theirs no way you can go wrong with anything. Everything on the menu is tastefull and fulfilling.. The customer service here alone is 5 stars . Even though they had a room full of people I felt acknowledged. The lady helping me was very patient since id never been here before & or me sample as many flavors as I wanted . The price is fair & worth it . Super yummy gilati (mango & vanilla is the best) ! I recommend stopping in !!. Best calabash style - fried seafood house in or around town. Get here early and expect a short wait to get a table. Once you are stated, you will not wait long for delicious hush puppies followed by great big giant plates of fried seafood! 
Enjoy. Best Thai food in Charlotte, no contest.

IMO it's hard to find good ethnic food in Charlotte, this being the ONLY exception.. Another great service experience at a Discount Tire location!

I called on Saturday morning to see if I could make an appointment to get my tires rotated and they asked how soon I could get there. 

When I arrived, they met me in the parking lot, greeted my by name, and got my car into the bay immediately. 

Less than 20 minutes later I was on my way with freshly rotated tires and a reminder of why I never buy tires anywhere other than Discount!. I had the spicy chipotle steakburger with a butterfinger shake. The burger was delicious and the milkshake was excellent as well, more on the milkier side than the creamier side. I liked that it was very reasonably priced for vegas and filled me up without being too much food or too greasy. For $23 or so you get all you get an all you can eat buffet. After a night of heavy drinking this is EXACTLY what you need. You can get omelettes, pancakes, eggs, bacon and just about anything you may need to recover. I loved the mango smoothies and desserts that they have. I loved their donuts in particular. They come out fresh every couple of minutes.. Great breakfast, Stopped in with some friends from out of town.

Friendly helpful staff. 

Quick and fun.

I will return.. This has been a lifesaver.   I am extremely happy with the staff and service.   Coming here hsd bright a lot of relief and vitality back into my life.  I highly recommend coming here.. We've established that I love burgers.  Therefore, it is to be expected that the Liberty, which routinely claims to have the best burger in Charlotte award (from whom, I don't quite know), has been on my to-try list for quite a while.  We were in the area for dinner last night, and so we popped in.

The inside of the restaurant is a relatively cool space.  There's a spacious bar room, which would be a good place to have a few drinks without feeling packed in.  The dining room is comfortable as well, and is decorated with beer kegs, beer quotes, etc.

However neat the decor was, we came for the food.  And we weren't disappointed.  I was excited to see poutine on the appetizer menu, since I've wanted to try this Canadian specialty from the moment I first became aware of its existence.  I wasn't disappointed.  The porcini gravy on the fries was especially delicious.

The burger was pretty dang good, too.  Was in the best in Charlotte?  Well, maybe.  I reserve my full commitment because, while the meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked, and the toppings were thoughtfully selected, the bun was a little on the minimalistic side.  I actually had to finish it with a knife and fork.  Now, a burger with too much bread is a sad thing, but the Liberty has gone too far in the other direction.  Mind you, this is a minor quibble.  iIf you go here, get the burger.  It's dang tasty.  Just be prepared for messiness.

I see some people have complained about the service, but our waitress was fine.  She wasn't super bubbly, but she was polite and kept our drinks filled.  What else can you ask for?. I was really impressed with this place.

I had just moved here and need some comfort spicy food and these guys hooked my up with tofu basil leaves that were awesome.

Go. Here.. Richard was our server, fantastic young man and a master of his craft. The food was delicious+.  They deserve nothing short of 5 stars for both service and food preparation.. I really enjoyed this place.  The atmosphere was amazing.  I'm from Portland, and this place really felt like home. They had a great beer selection, as well as a house brew.  Great place to chill with a friend or maybe a first date.. BEST Tacos Off the Strip!

How there are no other reviews of this place IDK!

It is always busy, It's Open late It has A drive thru it's Cheap and it is damn good.

I almost forgot it's ONLY 5 minutes west of the strip near IN & Out. Check it Out!!

I love the carne asada so I always get 6-8 tacos and 2 churros to go. It always hits the spot.. This pizza has a great bite. Crispy out and chewy in. I like how they slice there sausage like pepperoni. Took 37 years on west coast to find a pizza that had a perfect east coast slice. Not only is the pizza great so is the staff,delivery is spot on.. My coworkers picked Werra Thai for lunch.  I had yellow curry with beef off the lunch menu and had a water to drink.  I think it was $8.95 plus tax.  Great meal for a reasonable price.  There were four of us.  Each dish came out as it was ready instead of waiting to serve everyone at the same time.  A little awkward for some to people to eat while other wait, but not really a big deal.  It came with salad, soup, egg roll, rice, and the curry.  I really enjoyed it.  Very flavorful.  My coworkers complained that it was too spicy.  They ordered zero or one on a zero to ten scale.  Perhaps a one to a Thai person is an eight to an American.  he he he.  I recommend Weera Thai.. I have had quite a few drinks and appetizers here, but this was my first time trying breakfast. The menu allows for just about anything you might want for breakfast. My eggs were cooked perfectly and the English Muffin was nice. I tried the beet juice and was wishing it had a bit more sweetness to it. Highly recommend this place.. Great service but store has little seating. Use a different Starbucks if you want to hang out and do homework. Loud and noisy because it's in a grocery store. Thank you Jenny B for suggesting we go to this place!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!

Saturday night in Vegas we were trying to decide whether to go to a buffet or have all-you-can-eat sushi.  I'm sure the buffet would have been good too, but I'm glad we decided on the sushi.  Hikari is actually a Japanese steak house and sushi bar, so you can either sit at a table and have steak, seafood, etc or sit at the sushi bar for some great AYCE sushi, sashimi, rolls and appetizers.  

I'm a big fan of Midori in LA, but I have to say Hikari was better.  What I like more about Hikari is that they have some key things on their AYCE menu that Midori doesn't, namely sashimi.  You have your choice of nigiri or sashimi with the different types of sushi they offer.  I'm not a big fan of raw oysters on the half-shell, but they also offer that as part of the AYCE, which I know isn't normally cheap.  I don't remember everything I had here, but what I can remember includes shrimp tempura, miso soup, edamame, fried scallops (they call the "Frallops"), soft shell crab, a plate of mixed sashimi, tuna, yellowtail, super white tuna, salmon and shrimp nigiri.  I know there was more, but the dishes were coming so fast and furious I couldn't keep up.  My favorites were the crab, scallops and the super white tuna sashimi.  They put some spicy garlic jalapeno sauce on it which added a nice kick.  We also ended up getting some red bean, green tea, mango and strawberry mochi ice cream for dessert (which wasn't part of the AYCE so we had to pay extra for it).  

Overall everything was very good quality and very tasty.  I see some complaints about the service in other reviews, but I thought it was excellent.  We sat at the sushi bar so the chefs were right there, but they were super quick and attentive not only with the sushi that they made right there at the bar, but the cooks in the back that were making the appetizers and cooked dishes were putting them out in record time as well.  I don't think we waited more than 2 or 3 minutes for anything we ordered.  The sushi chefs had great attitudes and were very friendly.  

Note, they are open until 2am and from 11pm-2am they have the "good looking ladies" special where good looking ladies can eat AYCE for $22.50 instead of the normal price of $26.95.  Not sure who judges whether the ladies are good looking or not, but my guess is as long as you are a lady you'll get the special.  Drag queens of Vegas, sorry but you're probably out of luck.. SkinnyFat's has become one of my go to spots since moving to Vegas and I love how you can decide if you want that Healthy menu or that Happy Menu. Both with rock your socks.!. ** Carne Adovada **

This place was fine. Burgers were good but not the best but not the worst either. Had the philly burgers which was okay. Probably won't get it again. Wife had the English pub burger which was good. Staff was good and attentive. The burger was of good size.. Dr. Gallimore will put you at ease.  His team is always friendly.  The practice is kid friendly.. We have been patrons of the Tachi for years now.  We use their frequent diner card and have gotten several all-you-can-eats for free.

Some rolls that are our favorites:
New York Girl in Vegas
Salmon Delight
American Dream
Tiger
Moon River

LOVE this place!!!  Highly recommend it!  Fresh every time.. The Penang is out of the world. Jungle curry was really good. Pad Thai was just ok.. Not the cheapest price wise, but the food is great, and service is good. I highly recommend the happy roll!. I've been eating at Pedros since 2011 and its great every time. It's old school Glendale Mexican comfort food. Yes it's dark and seems dated inside, but that's because it is both of those things. As long as that doesn't dissuade you, it's a must try.. I wanted to get an Arizona half sleeve to cover up a crappy tattoo that I had gotten done while 15 so I went to some cheapo in Chandler.. bad move.  So, I came here after and asked Alex if he could "Awesome this up" he did, and now it's rad!  Good price, great work, this is where I'm going from now on!. I had a return visit.  Things were still good as always, great beers on top including a house made stout that was more like a chocolate milkshake.  Fish of the day was a spectacular fresh catch with homemade gnocchi.  I never thought I could get full on eating fish but this one here you could.  The duck carpaccio though is exquisite including a raw egg on top with some horseradish and mixed in hot sauces..

I will say though there poutine is kind of a disappointment.  I found it too salty.  As always the place is a monument to excess.  I can't go back cause the food's just too much, but it is someplace everyone should see.  However, I have had my fill... I am done!. The perfect choice for a great dining experience.  Made a 7:30 reservation on a Friday night and we got there early and got seated right away. Salad bar was a great start and even had fresh haddock. Then on to the main course. My wife and I have been to these types of high end steak places and the best tip I can give you is hold out for the meat choice you really want. We love filet mignon and the bacon wrapped chicken, but it all tastes great... As it should for $50 per person.. June 20th 2011
Ordered:
Fish Tacos
I've been here numerous times just this year... figured it's time to actually review it.  Am I am fan?  Most definitely.. Why else would I keep coming back?

Pros:
  Another familiar chain at the Town Square.  What an awesome location!
  Very good happy Hour.  Cheap Eats doesn't always mean subpar food.
  Friendly staff.  Every time I have came staff always engage in convo.
  Flat Screens throughout the bar.  There isn't a bad seat in the bar.

Cons:
  Chips were stale.  What a disappointment.
  The entire bar area had a popcorn smell.
  
Verdict:
  Okay, so my chips were stale, but overall this is an awesome place to go eat... especially during happy hour.  Even when you are not in the bar and are eating here, it's really good.  If you've never been to a Claim Jumpers, make sure to check it out!  The portions are gigantic and the quality of the food is pretty impressive in my opinion.  I haven't had anything that I didn't care for (aside from the stale chips).  I'd definitely come again.

Tips:
  Looking for cheap eats and a place to catch sports? Look no more !
  Do not eat at the bar early lunch... they make popcorn and the whole bar area smells of its scent.  It was messing with my taste buds.  If I want popcorn I'll go to Rave.
  Come during happy hour.  Everyone often goes to Yard House (which is also good for happy hour, but is extremely crowded).  Claim Jumpers is less crowded.
  Order the Fried Zucchini... Definitely one of my Favorites !!. Saw one reviewer derisively call this "Bougie Heaven" as though Bougies don't deserve nice things too. Publicus is new but leads the pack for Las Vegas standard bearing - flavorful, tasty, complex foods.  Yes they charge for it.  Certainly there is an air of we're working out the service side, please stand by  But c'mon, every other category hits 5 stars in the accessible gourmet department including atmosphere. Too many great food options to list but try the roast beef, a side salad of the day and a brownie for dessert as a first time.  Regarding the coffee, if you're picky and snobby (like me) I recommend you ask for Cole and explain what you like. You will be amazed at the tailored beverage that comes your way.  Otherwise order off menu but don't freak if you don't like it. ..theres a method to this coffee madness and it's just a palate thing.  Calm down.  Try again.  This is multiple levels away from Starbucks status quo...so acclimate yourself and enjoy.. This is probably the best Hawaiian food in all of Las Vegas! The food, staff, and atmosphere at Island Flavor bring me back to my vacations in Hawaii. You definitely have come here hungry as the portions are big enough to share or to have left overs. I always get the poke appetizer which is very fresh tuna. I usually also get a mixed plate which lets you get 2 different local favorites (either chicken katsu, beef teriyaki, chicken teriyaki, hamburger steak, shrimp, kalbi ribs, roast pork, chop steak, or korean chicken). The Loco Moco is also very good and on Fridays you can get the Hawaiian plate special with lau lau. Come hungry, hang out and relax to traditional hawaiian food that makes you feel like you are back on the islands.. Well went here for the UFC  fight and they were at seating capacity. Basically we could stand at the entrance and watch the fight and order drinks. The cool thing was they had great drink prices and the server always came around to check. Went in for an adjustment and came out with such an amazing experience. Dr. Josh was very professional. He was very attentive to my injuries and did several different types of adjustments on me. Some, I had never experienced before.
I highly recommend this service.. 1) definitely search Groupon in November or December for a 1/2 off vip pass.  With the vip pass you get into the event one hour early and avoid huge lines.  You also get into Tao Nightclub after.    

2) We spent the first hour gorging ourselves and meeting people and getting very intoxicated on wine, vodka and saki concoctions.  The Fantasy girls sang, there was an illusionist.  We got to see the cupcake wars winner and other famous pastry chefs we never heard of.  There was a dried meat station with salami's and delicious roast pork.  We tried coconut cream cilantro chocolate and blood orange gluten free chocolate.  

3) We thought it would be bigger or that there would be something more after the vip session. Nope.  After the hour was over, the only new thing was the non-vip's entering the room.  We left shortly after the hour was up and sat in the venetian sportsbook contemplating our next move. 

1-2 hours is definitely the max you could spend here.  The fifth star is the wow factor.  There simply wasn't a wow factor once your eyes took in all the chocolate.  In fact, even in the vip session there was little time to observe the artistry of the chocolate displays.  It would have been nice if there was some period before the tasting began to just walk around and look at the displays.

Everyone was very friendly and eager to explain their contributions to the world of chocolate, only problem was people got upset because it held up the line.  Maybe if there was a mingler outside the booth speaking it would have been better.

Still we ate and drank until we could drink no more and left happy.. My wife and I went to Ri Ra on Sunday night, September 15th for the Seattle-San Fran football game and we had a fantastic time. Our waitress, Joy, could not have been nicer. We stayed at our table for the entire game, close to 4 hours, eating and drinking. We loved everything we ate. The onion rings, buffalo wings and Irish cheddar mac with chicken are all recommended. The service was fast and attentive. Everyone was very friendly. It was a great atmosphere to watch the game and enjoy ourselves. We can't wait to go back to Vegas so we can visit Ri Ra again!. I came here to have my first In N Out Burger, and I was not disappointed!  I had a double double, animal style fries, and a milkshake.  When I'm on vacation, I don't like going to the same place more than once... we went back to In N Out.. Aye fam, foreal. I ordered boneless wings and straight up got meatballs, it wasn't what I expected but it was hella dank. Beer flow was chillin and the service was outstanding. My server was bangin, on my mama I woulda wifed her up. 
3 hunna Courtney baby girl if you readin this I still luh u. Pretty good place for pizza with a two-year old.  I ordered, waited for the food and watched the game while my wife played with baby on the adjacent playground.  The pizza (basil chicken and sausage) was pretty good and the service was fine.   And unexpectedly, the coffee was great.. Living in the Phoenix area you get tired of the same ol' pizza, sandwiches, and chinese/vietnamese/thai food that you can get on just about every corner gets extremely tiring.  Finding something a little different has been a Godsend.  

I've never had Malaysian cooking before but I've seen pictures and it always looked so good. And guess what!  It IS so good!  I've tried two dishes from delivery and both have been amazing.  

First thing I had was Nasi Lemak.  I LOVE having different flavors and everything was delicious.  The sambal was one of the best things I've ever eaten!  I did try the momo chaha and sadly, I just wasn't ready for yams in a sweetened milk.  It wasn't bad, but my tastebuds have some evolving to do before I try it again.

Second time I ordered mee siam.  It was amazing!  And don't forget the bandung drink.  It's a little different but you can't miss out on it.  My friends in Singapore have told me how good it was and they are not lying!  

I can't wait for my next meal at BP Street :D. Last night was my third Wranglers game ever.  They played the Idaho Steelheads and lost to them in an OT shoot out.  

Apparently I heard the Wranglers were number one in the West Coast Division which baffles me.  Two of the games I've been to, counting last night, the Wranglers have lost.  Maybe I'm going to the wrong ones.

I love the fact that you can just grab a beer, some carmelized nuts and yell profanity at the opposing team.  I love these games!  I love the chants, I love the fights and I love the chuck a pucks.  By the way, I was irritated with the referee last night, number 78.  He kept breaking up all the fights.  Only one really broke out.  I also don't like the Duke.  That green mascot is weird, I just don't get it.

Tonight, we used a Groupon for two people.  The staff was nice enough to seat our group of 4 together.  There was a total of 6,989 fans that attended the game which was also the most people I've ever seen at a Wranglers game.  

I do have a lot of stress in my life and it's great to come to a game where it's ok to get out my aggression verbally.  The first game I've attended, I was fortunate to get a free taco because the Wranglers scored 5 times.  I'm really going to need them to get it together and do it again!. Hakkasan is one of my favorite clubs in Vegas.  The DJ lineup is sick especially with Calvin Harris and Steve Aoki.  If you come on a weekend be prepared to wait in line or you can skip the line and buy a table.  Tables on the main dance floor get crowded easily. If you prefer a little more space get a table up top that overlooks the dance floor as this area won't be as busy.  If you aren't into EDM the Ling Ling room plays hip hop. It is a lot smaller however.

Best part about Hakkasan....chargers built into the table. I hate it when my phone dies while I'm out all night!. Quiant little out of the way wine bar with a very unique selection of wines to enjoy in a relaxed casual atmosphere. Right on the light rail line so that you don't have to worry about drinking and driving!. This was the third time I've been here and still have not had a beverage other than a taste of their very good Lemonade!  Each time I'm enjoying the Art -  Local Artists represent, Paintings (landscapes, abstracts, many different styles and tastes), Jewelry, cookies with art and more!  Friendly, helpful staff, great spot!

***** 12 - 2 - 2012  Update!  Now I have taken my Girlfriend twice and we got Coffee!  Very Good!  Great place to watch the people and the Art is constantly changing!. I needed carpet installed in a hurry. Sales staff was courteous and pricing was straight forward. Installation crew showed up on time, completed the job timely and cleaned up after themselves. The end result looks great.. Nobu was my first experience at a Michelin rated restaurant (one star).

Omakase is the Japanese term for trusting the chef to come up with an enjoyable meal whether it's sushi or a classic European cuisine.  It's an exciting way to try the more creative and special dishes from the chef's knife.  It requires about two hours for dinner but well worth the time.  When you order, you'll be asked about allergies and this is a good time to mention the types of seafood that you don't like.

If your party is four or less, I recommend siting at the sushi bar.  We luckily sat in good view of the lead sushi chef and watched his amazing knife and prep skills.  He was very focused in his tasks but explained each round of courses personally.  There is a high level of construction/presentation involved with each dish so I was in awe of his techniques.

One really surprising thing was the appearance of black caviar, white truffle slices, kobe beef, and foie gras during the run of courses.  All those fantastic flavors in one sitting.  My friends and I opted for the $150 per person course.  There is a $200 option too.

Having lived in the Seattle area most of my life, I've been able to enjoy really good sushi restaurants.  However, I was astounded by how good the dishes are at Nobu.  Insanely good flavors and worth the price jump.. Starbucks.  What can I say.   This one is pretty quick with the drive-thru service, although in general Starbucks drive-thrus are pretty darn slow no matter what time it is.

And on a hawt day, you just can't lay off those coffee frappacinos, ya know?   Just nom nom, frappe, nom nom.

That, and a cinammon swirl coffee cake, completes the taste bud madness.  Truly one of your coffee nom nom places.. A '94 Rocket myself, I heard a good buzz about this place from folks in the old 'hood.  I brought my two little burger critics with me as well (ages 10 and 12).  Lots of soda to choose from, great hamburgers, and delicious fries.  It beats the heck out of a chain burger place in quality and character.  I even ordered the "Rocket Burger" which is a ridiculous three-patty monstrosity on a 10-inch sub roll.  I was embarrassed in front of my kids because I couldn't even finish my fries.  Rocket Burger has the makings to be a classic joint, legendary if they can match Capin' Bills longevity!. Ate lunch there yesterday and had a very good patty melt.  I will eat there again and it was really reasonable too!. What a great place! This is honestly some of the best Vietnamese I have had. Had lunch there today with a friend and it was excellent. We both had the Pho and it was very good with huge portions. I also tried one of the "Sub Sandwiches and it was excellent! The Staff and owners were so friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back!!!. Best Pizza in The Green Valley area.  I like this spot alot, obviously came in for pizza and wasn't disappointed.  Also the calamari appetizer is pretty darn good as well.  Decent beer selection.  Staff is friendly and very helpful.  If you have kids they give out  pizza dough for them to play with, which is good cuz they have fun with it and it keeps them busy.  They have daily specials on this little calendar  they put on your table, so check them out.  Two draw backs are as follows.....a lil pricey and can get pretty busy during the weekend other than that LilMark gives it a Good to Go.. Went here for an Eagles game with my buddy.....they are the Eagles headquarters for games. A great place to catch some live music. Typical atmosphere you would expect from a "rock" bar.....awesome smoking patio. Our waitress Cassie was amazing.. I use to sell tickets for Gordie when he was a the Venetian. This was the second time I have seen him perform. He is such a talented man. He just keeps going and going. He can tell jokes, impersonate, sing you name it. I don't know how he gets the energy. I practically had to be wheeled out of there because I was laughing SO HARD.  This show should win best in Las Vegas. I will continue to tell people to see gordie brown.  If you are staying down town Las Vegas there isn't any reason to not see this show. I hope this show is here for many years to come.. Just ate here with my wife for the 1st time & it was excellent! On a very busy Sunday morning we got seated within 20mins. The food came out fast & was hot & just the way we ordered it. The service was wonderful & at first I felt they had fair prices, but after seeing how big the portions were I knew we made out in the deal. As full as I was when leaving I still managed to take out some of the amazing desserts from the bakery. Would I go back you ask? I'm debating about going for lunch.. We took the Metro from downtown based on a recommendation by a local and I am so glad we did. One of us had the Red Snapper which filled the plate and the other had the Shrimp curry which was prepared Trini-style, different that I am used to, since I have only had the Jamaican style.  This one has carrots, medium-sized shrimp, plenty of rice, and plantain (sp??). I wish there had been more plantain. The portion was enought for two to share, especially if you are going back to a hotel room like I did and unable to take leftovers.  There was a live DJ on the Friday when we ate there.  Oh, and the price was only about $8 and $10 a piece.. The lasagna was not presented in the typical layered fashion.  It was split into three pieces and decked with cheese.  I could have done with less cheese on the dish, but it was overall very well prepared.. Very good! A unique Italian and menu that allows you to construct your own meatball dish. The second floor does pizza and the third has an partially open-air rooftop bar. Cool place!. What a wonderful experience!

This time I ordered the "veggie platter" and the "meat platter" (see photos). A sampling of all different spices and textures.

The iced tea had a sexy hint of clove and other spices. MrOwR!

A rare gem in Las Vegas.. I'm a huge fan of all the Upward Projects restaurants, but Postino is by far my favorite.  I've been to all the Postino locations a bunch of times.  Gilbert is actually my favorite location.  Compared to the others, the space here is huge. They've done it up in a cool modern industrial design style.  Large garage doors open to the outside for those beautiful 80 degree nights we have in the Valley.  The crowd is surprisingly young and hip for Gilbert (sorry).  If I didn't know better, I'd think I was in Central Phoenix.  They've got ample outdoor patio space.  It's great for a romantic one-on-one evening, or for a large group of people.  Check it out on Monday and Tuesday nights after 8 for the Bottle and Board special.. I wish that I had the words to express adequately just how special this place is.  As far as the wonderful food and impeccable and caring service are concerned, this review will "mirror" what others already have posted here on Yelp!  I encourage everyone to read them, as they are full of insights and examples as to why and how the food served here is full of passion, care and special ingredients.
Perhaps what I can add to the posts already here is my attempt to convey the social message and community mission of this dining destination which is literally the front door and welcoming station to institution dedicated to human rights, understanding, dialogue and education about many topics "ripe" with all sorts of implications and social controversy.

From the free wifi, to the community meeting rooms, to the wide variety of community partners in the "Center" of downtown Las Vegas' emergent neighborhoods which are in the midst of an urban renaissance.

The Bronze Cafe is deliberately designed to nourish the mind and the soul as well as the stomach.  It structured to engender discussion and understanding, as well as nourishment.  Its ownership and management have chosen very ambitious goals and responsibilities -- and they carry out these tasks with dignity, hospitality and professionalism.

Oh, and not incidentally, the food is awesome.  And, although I was just a "random" community member, as a welcomed member of Green Drinks Las Vegas at its monthly meeting last night hosted by the Bronze Cafe at The Center, I was honored to be treated to a wide "tasting menu" last night.   I and about 20 others at this community meeting were provided a number of sandwich and drink samples from this restaurant which is truly a community treasure on many levels.   I can assure you that everything without exception was delicious, full of healthy ingredients lovingly and expertly and professionally chosen with care.

Could I say more.  Probably.  But the point is that this business is special and I encourage others to take advantage of everything that it has to offer.. Chocolate wasteedddd! Lol. fun fun fun place for a couple or family. Enjoy wonderful dessert cocktails or fondue with your love ones. delicious shakes too. Friendly staff but needs refinement in service and product knowledge. Even the manager had no clue what I was eating but after you dip into that chocolate and take that first bite...can't feel nothing but happy. max brenner you bald genius ! Can't wait to go back.. This is the reason I like shopping with a small local place.  I went in late in the afternoon with a leaky tire.  He confirmed my suspicion that I would need a new tube and proceeded to install it while we chatted about bicycles and small business climate.  Then he tried to charge me less than the service was worth, especially as I did not have to make a second trip back to pick up the tire.

They have been in business with the same owner for I think over 20 years, now in their 3rd location.  I have an issue with a seat post so I will be back in soon.. Lon's has a new lunch menu, featuring smaller portions with lower prices.  This is perfect for me!  You can use this to make an a la carte approach, and so get what you really want.

Try a pork belly taco and the spinach salad.  This is great!. Great dinner  ! ! !  Service was perfect, Kevin was there when needed but did not hover. 
I had the Filet and Scallops, and my wife had the Prime Rib. Never had better of either. The Filet was expected to be great, no disappointment there, the Prime Rib was way better than expected.. Nobody EVER wants to have to go to a shop, but had an incredible experience here.  Mike and sister and crew are true professionals who are experts in their field and deliver outstanding customer service.  You have plenty of options on 7th St but the local Mercedes dealership is closed and they're a GREAT place.  Got me right in, told me what the problem was, gave me an expert diagnosis and fixed it within a couple hours at a very reasonable rate.  Been to a lot of shops and this was seriously the best ever.  Professional, honest, highly knowledgeable know what they can and can't do and do what they do well.  Highly recommend!. Went here to get my mother's car smog checked. It's just around the corner from our house, so that right there was a huge advantage to going here. I drove right up, got everything done in less than 10 minutes, was able to pay by credit card, AND got a CD out of it; for those scoring at home, it was a Los Tigres del Norte CD (East LV por vida!). Easily the most stress free transaction I've ever had involving a car.

If you're ever in need of a smog check and you're on the far east side of town, hit up Nate's.. For a place where people are chugging beer, standing on tables, and getting spanked with wood paddles, it sure is well-lit!


Having been to the Hofbrauhaus in Munich, and Chicago, I was expecting a raucous time with lots of singing and beer.  This is exactly what I got when I walked into the Las Vegas location.  

Come here for the beer and the ambience.  This is the type of place where it's almost guaranteed you'll be singing "Sweet Caroline,"  at some point in the night; Is there anything else you need for a great time?  BAH-BAH-BAAAH!!!  (Go ahead and belt out the chorus real quick, it can't hurt)

The beer is good, you can drink out of a glass boot, you can get a shot of Jagr (which is punishment enough) followed by a "Dazed and Confused-esque" paddling.  These waitresses don't mess around either, you can hear the slaps of wood on clothed butt cheeks echo through out the hall.  

I would recommend avoiding the food, as it's a bit on the pricey side (the pretzels are great though) and coming here to socialize, enjoy some beer, and good music played by the band.  It does get loud, but if you're looking for a quiet place to drink beer and sing, check out the reference section of the library.. Best broken rice dishes in town.  Good nem nuong as well, and finally found a good bowl of bun bo hue in vegas, my new favorite viet place here.. Got a recommendation from a friend and he was spot on.  You walk in and think you are in Greece. 

Food was fantastic.  Service was fantastic.  The owner came from behind the counter to make sure everything was ok.  Hidden gem in Sun City.. Food 5++++ stars
Service 1 star
Atmosphere 2.5 stars
Value 5 stars
Lack of Beer/Wine 1 star

I found Thai House and ate it for lunch, dinner, and lunch the next day.  If I need to tell you anything about the food after that, maybe you should go back and read the first sentence again.

The food ain't the problem.  In fact, I really wish this place was located closer to either my house or my office.  I would spend a whole lot of time here.  

Thai House is like a restaurant that took over an existing restaurant space and went and spent about $17 on Thai themed wall art. If you took down the two or three things that look Thai, they could literally turn it into a taco place or a pizza joint in a half-hour.  You don't come here for the ambiance.  They were also playing Miley Cyrus on the speakers, and I'm about 75% sure she's not Thai.  

Service SUCKS!  It's got to be a Mom & Pop shop and the kids were forced to work here.  The one girl waitress I had was pleasant, but didn't seem to grasp basic concepts - like bring out both my and my wife's plates out at the same time, not 5 minutes apart. C'mon, man!  The two young guys?  Pretty sure they'd rather be out at the skate park.  Clearly, they're not into the whole "customer" thing.  I did see "Mom" (if it is a family biz), and she was super-nice.  We told her how much we loved the food.  We left out how incompetent her kids were.

At some point, Thai House has to invest in:

(a) a beer & wine license, 
(b) at least a basic atmosphere upgrade, 
(c) service staff that actually give a shit.  

But damn, that food was amazing!. Had dinner at Cowboy Ciao last night and the food was outstanding.  We had mac and cheese and the Chopped Salad as an appetizer and then fillet Mignon, Hamburger and Korean Short ribs for our main course.  Every thing tasted expectational.  

What is holding me back from giving Cowboy Ciao five stars is the noise level in the restaurant.  there were eight of us at dinner and It was so loud that people at one end of the table could not communicate with the people at the other end.  For that matter it was difficult to speak with the people in front of you.  On two different occasions throughout the evening the waiter did not bring items out that we had ordered because he did not hear our request.  

The decor is great, I would suggest some type of treatment to work on the acoustics so people can have a conversation at dinner. 

This was my first time having dinner here.  I have been there for lunch a few times.  I will stick to lunch where it seems to be a little bit more conducive for visiting.. The level of customer service and expertise from Lanza is excellent.  They worked tirelessly with me to build an outstanding home theater system.  I recommend them fully without reservation.. I hit these guys the day after the worst snow storm in a decade to come through Charlotte. The staff had spent the previous night at the airport and was exhausted. I got the nachos, which were terrible. However, my waitress got it taken off my bill without me even asking for it. 
The wait staff was amazing! Will definitely go there again even if it's in a concourse I hardly ever visit.. I am going through a phase of writing very short reviews... so I'll make this good.

I love this place!  The tortas are amazing, especially the carne asada torta.  I believe it has grilled jalapeños on it so it has a little kick!  Deeelish!

The steak tacos are tiny, but packed with tons of flavor.  Traditional street style with steak, onions, cilantro.  Yum!

Go here.. This was one the best Jack in the Box's that we had ever been to.  The staff was very friendly and it was always very clean.

Sadly it closed today.. Having been fucked over by U-Haul one too many times, I passed over their convenient downtown locations and headed out to the airport for a recent move.  

This is how truck rental should be done.  Quick, efficient, clean, reasonably priced. And they had the advantage on U-Haul in that they actually had trucks available.  

One caveat: moving season in Madison is August and this rental was in November.  That might account for the ease of the transaction.. What's not for me to love?  Same Roosters only way closer to the LKN area.  Have been to the Uptown location twice now and each visit brought a 5 Star experience.  Food, service, wine selection... All are spot on.  

My wife and I went ahead of the Coldplay concert this past Tuesday and had another great meal.  Whenever something from the daily specials menu sounds like it will hit the spot, we go that direction.  This visit that meant a fig salad for her and a wild boar ravioli for me.  Both were outstanding.  I had a Caesar and she the Pasta and tomato sauce from the regular menu to supplement and they were excellent as well.

Keep up the good work Chef Noble.... This is a really good Starbucks location. The service is always friendly, and they're really quick during the morning rush.. This place is more than just "back health" it improves my life every time I go in. Everyone is a professional and genuinely cares about improving your life.. In a city full of bars and clubs, this one holds its own by being a dive bar.. only las vegas style... people don't come here in jeans unless their american rag but at least you can get in somewhere with jeans, right? In any case, this is a nice placeto set up shop when you feel like going out, but not going all out.. The Blackened Grouper is my favorite and the combination of flavors with the fish and flavors melted in my mouth.  This is my go to sandwich for lunch.  The owner knows fish and everything is fresh.  Took a pound of shrimp home and more grouper. Very fresh.  You don't have to go to Central Avenue for fresh seafood in Charlotte. Monroe Road works just fine.. This is a nice cafe to relax and enjoy the various amount of items that are used to decorate the place. It makes for an ideal place of getting a drink while studying.. Heard about the "Main Event". $59 per couple (includes a bottle of wine)! That's crazy! Was extremely surprised as to how good the food and service was. Our server (Natalie) gave us some suggestions and had a great personality. We shared the corn bread app, each had a salad. Then I had grilled trout and my guest had the ribeye! Too full... Had to take the banana pie home.  We will go back... Soon!. A friend of mine introduced me to this place, and I thank him for it!  We were a bit late for the lunch special, so I ended up doing a dinner combo.  I got orange chicken, which also came with low mein, fried rice and a bowl of egg flower soup.  All of it was amazing!  By far the best orange chicken I have ever had, they cut it in thin strips and bread it very lightly!. Loved it.. Have returned to Payard several times since my last review and the bistro continues to be simply outstanding. My wife's vanilla latte was the "best I've ever had". I took a sip and is was so creamy and smooth that I would have to agree with her. I had the continental breakfast for the first time and it was very good. Lox, herbed creamcheese and great bagels, Crossiants,  other baked goods, yougurt, fresh fruit, granola and rolled delli meats. Just a great little spread, Your beverage is included in the price too.. This is hands down one of the best restaurants downtown.  We had been meaning to come here for many months but we could never get a reservation.  We finally got one and it was worth the wait. Starting from the ambiance is great! Both for a casual dinner (e.g., around the bar area) but also for a romantic date or even a family gathering.  The food selection is great and the cocktail menu has a wide variety! The service is also extremely fast and helpful.  I cannot wait to go back and try more of their stuff.  Definitely worth making reservation even if it is 2 months later :). Best deal in town. Bring in your own cup and get a coffee for 1.07.

The staff is very friendly, plenty of tables to meet with people or to do work.

This is my second office!. Great staff, good sushi and always busy. The constant wait should tell you something.  It's one of better AYCE sushi places in town but the wait time can be a hindrance. The sesame chicken and teriyaki beef for appetizers are very good. Most rolls I had are great and made well. I would refer this place to anyone just be cautious that the wait may be a while.. Very good food - actually lots of very good food at moderate prices.  Guaranteed your grandmother never thought of these combinations!  Come hungry!. Microsoft Band2をこちらで購入。BestBuy等にも売っていますが端末を実際に腕につけて確認できるのでこちらの店頭がオススメです。あとLumia 950はまだ発売開始されてなかったので、こちらは購入できず...。640のunlocked版は売ってました。. Maybe I'm becoming a softy with my recent ratings.  I don't know...but the Phoenix Valley is a foodie paradise, that much cannot be argued.  So I find myself having a hard time figuring out why I shouldn't give this place 5 stars.  The few complaints others had, I did not experience.  I went in here on a Monday night.

Service:
The moment I walked in, 2 attentive ladies (one the official greeter), they were willing to seat me right away at a table, I opted for the bar.  They were friendly and nice.  

Kevin I believe was the name of the bartender.  He not only tended bar but took orders for the bar and the whole area out there.  I point this out because even despite that, he was on top of everything, I did not wait any amount of time for anything, and he was friendly and informative.  Asking questions about the menu, he was versed in it and helped me decide even on the sauce to top the lasagna I ordered.  I opted for the sweeter marinara instead of the beef sauce...and oh my was that a good recommendation.

So...that brings us to the food:

I got the lasagna with the sweet marinara sauce.  It all complemented each other perfectly and tasted excellent.  I just finished off the other half I brought home...and like any good lasagna...tasted just as good on reheat as when fresh.  The fresh bread they serve with the meal too...very good.  The drinks...he was on top of it and they too were good.  

So again....maybe I'm getting soft....but I can't find any reason whatsoever to dock this place anything.  I enjoyed every interaction I had with their staff...heck...I'd almost go as far as to say I felt welcome there as if I'd walked into someone's home.  The barkeep was on top of the service.  ...and the food was great.  So...5 stars it is.. Pretty cookie cutter when it comes to serve yourself yogurt places. But the flavors offered rotate and the toppings are fresh. 

Gotta try the cookie dough when they have it!  And 1 time was there was a German chocolate cake flavor. Mmmmm! So good.. The bar and atmosphere was whatever, but I give this place 5 stars for service. Came out to Phoenix for a road trip and have been getting crap service everywhere we went. Casa was a thankful refresher from that. Our server was Amber and she was absolutely amazing. She was constantly checking on us and was more than friendly about different places to go and see. Not sure if the other servers are as good as her, but she was the best.. I had a fabulous haddock platter that came with fries, onion rings, and really good homemade tarter sauce and coleslaw. Big portions so plan to take home. Nice family run place with cool atmosphere and good service! Will be back again soon to try lobster roll and clam chowder!. Needs signage! FB says its in parking lot but after aimlessly driving thru all their parking areas, I was ready to give up. Luckily I saw someone with shopping bags so I just asked her - she couldn't even explain the way, had to walk me over and point it out. So... here's my attempt at explaining it. 

Park in the first section of solar panel covered spots and walk back down the road to a little service road on the left. Short walk to a little metal ramp on the left to an unmarked building, and that's the farmers market! 

I slept in so didn't get there till 1230, a few booths were empty but there was still a good selection. They had some pretty exotic produce in addition to the expected lettuce, apples and squash. Things were a little pricey, but hey its Vegas and almost January

I'm bummed I had missed the guy who locally farms shrimp, there's always next week.. Huge trench mud hole is the only down side. Dogs and people are friendly. There is a fountain for the pups, plenty of poop bags and a few stray balls to play with. I've been going to Matt at Fu's since before they moved to Noda. I have 5 pieces of artwork some new and some coverups, wouldn't go anywhere else. 
Great tattoo parlor,  great artists and atmosphere. Don't think you'll walk-in and get ink on the spot,  it's by appointment and they are busy because they are that good. 
Highly recommend Fu's.. Our table of 7 ordered the $118 per person prix fixe menu and everything tasted great.  This is by far the most i've ever paid for chinese food and i prob would'nt do it again.  My wife's mother would have killed us for eating here. hahaha 

Service was great...not Gary Danko great but still attentive. The restaurant itself was really dark tho. There were a lot of areas at our table that the overhead light just didnt reach and it was hard to read the menu or see the food.

It was a good experience to try a lot of different dishes, but I wouldn't do it again..at least not that prix fixe menu. My favorites were the jasmine tea smoked beef short rib, black pepper beef ribeye and the sea bass.. This place is the best! I've been coming here for 3 months and have never been disappointed.  The food is great and the service can't be beat. It might take a few minuets to get your food, that's only because it's made fresh to order.. Great place for all the furry critters, Great staff and owners all treat us so nice when we shop here.... Obvi had to get the vegan donuts while in town! 

Not thrilled about their hours especially when you need an afternoon donut fix. 

The shop is nothing special, but the service was very nice. We wanted to try a donut before loading up for the trip back home and I appreciated that no one pushed us to pay for the one donut right away. Tried the glazed and have since also had the sugar donut. Both were very good - not the best vegan donuts I have ever had (that honor goes to Mighty-O in Seattle) but very good anyway. The prices are also definitively lower than other donut places, which kinda makes me regret not having purchased more donuts. Not a place that I would want to go hang out in, but the donuts are worth the trip over. 

**Note: Check the hours before you go and make sure you take some cash since it's cash only!. Good food, but beers were average at best.  A little surprised because I was expecting the opposite. I had the chicken enchiladas with a couple of over easy eggs on top.  Not as good as Pappasito's in Houston/Atlanta, but compared to other options, quite tasty. My daughter enjoyed the burger.  Sampled three beers including the double pumpkin, peach ale, white ale and gave up and order the kölsch which was disappointing as well.. OMG....I am reviewing....gasp, my Scottsdale friends, gasp, yes, a FLEA MARKET. And no, this is not where momma fleas buy milk for their young. The flea market or swap meet here in downtown Phoenix was a new experience for me. And let me tell you, it is pretty damn fun. Now, I can only take it for so long. Like fabric shopping with Rickie. Or hearing about my parents' neighbors goiter. It is huge. I'm pretty sure we were the only two mo's perusing the neon lamps, Frauda sunglasses and mattresses. Yes, they do sell mattresses. Please. Step away from the mattresses. Oh, and probably not the best place to get that tattoo. But, if you're looking for a new sunglasses, like my Foui Vouitton's ($8) and I've had them over a year and receive numerous compliments, you should hit up this place. After paying a buck or two to get in, you walk past lots of weird candy (it ain't Snickers and such) like sugary, lemony, chile spiced fried things. Not as bad as it sounds. I found the COOLEST Eiffel Tower statue that when you pull on it, A SWORD comes out!!!! Yes, you heard me. Just what every nightstand needs. And shoes. Yes, I bought a pair of $25 shoes and no kidding, get more compliments than my $240 Johnston & Murphy's. The best part is tucked away in the corner and it's truly the hidden gem. A store totally dedicated to Hello Kitty, Brady Bunch, Betty Boop, Charlie's Angels and all things pop culture. I could spend all day in this part. If you're up for something different and before it gets too hot, skee daddle on down to Washington Ave. Oh and they also have deodorant, make up, those pictures that you plug in and they have Jesus and a waterfall, with moving Jesus and water, all lit up, and an entire Kimono booth, incense, cookware and a man who makes guacamole, stuffed animals and while you're at the flea market you can even have your car windows tinted or a mural put on the side of your van!. The new location for this long time Valley favorite is in Old Town Scottsdale on Restaurant row right accross from Cowboy Ciao.  This used to be Digestiff.  

The Marcellino's people have done a wonderful job of creating an entirely different attidtude on this side of Stetson Drive.  Still very cool, very ambient, very laid back and not at all pretentious, but still different experience.

The thick cranberry colored drapesgive an old world quality to the mostly urban brickwork comprising most of the walls.  lit mostly by chandeliers and candlelight, the interior is warm, intimate and easy. No garish paintings or stereo typical florentine towers to be seen.  Well, there was a small reproduction of Rome's " Mouth of Truth" bolted to the wall next to the entry that kept staring down at me.  I liked it.  It brought back happy memories of Rome.

We would be experiencing the Tasting menu ($75 with 3 courses and 3 pairings)  Our server, Scott, made sure we had no food allergies or road blocks towards anything in particular.  A small cheese, olive and salami plate arrived first, compliments of the Chef.  Scott then proceeded to send over dish after dish of amazing Italian classics , like the large, single handmade ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach bathed in an almost invisible butter sauce.  There was also some unexpected delights like the polenta strips topped with a chunky portobello reduction and the perfectly portioned filet mignon.  Each was delightfully different and kept our pallettes busy with incredible flavors and textures.

Wine pairings were also carefully selected and added that supreme finish to each plate. The tasting menu with pairings are always different, so you can simply come in sit down and relax and be taken care of. No regretful commitments to be made.

After four courses, with 3 wine pairings we were quite content to fold up our napkins and call it quits, but there was still more!  Scott finished us off with a beautiful Tiramisu accompanied with freshly whipped cream that was ablaze and courted with artfully sliced strawberries.  The Tiramisu was light, airy and delicately creamy.

Live music on Saturday nights differs from week to week from opera to jazz to Sinatra.  This Sunday evening we had a mixture of Sade and other light jazz simmering from the sound system.

A wonderful evening was had and will be remembered.  thank you Marcellino's!. Decided to give this place a shot with my fiance and i'm so glad i did. They serve all the seafood by the pound and you pick the seasoning as well as the heat level. the server Jeff told us the that their spices are pretty hot so we went with medium and it was still hot!! We got some crab and some shrimp and it was absolutely delicious. We have definitely found our new favorite place to eat!. Honest, thorough and competent.  I wholeheartedly recommend this shop!  General maintenance or major repair these are the guys to go to. They maintain 3 of my vehicles and they have always been spot on.. Whenever I need to take a cab in a new city, I worry that they're just never going to show up. The driver from Clean Air Cab called me back when he was on the way, and showed up promptly (I'd guess about 10 minutes from when I called). Perfect service.. Man, working with this place was such a relief. My wife and I have been driving our 2004 Hyundai Elantra for a couple of years, and although we like the car, it's pretty beat up. It's our "who really cares" car if something gets scratched or the interior gets messed up a bit.

So imagine our concern when we started hearing a terrible noise coming from the front wheels at slow speeds. We knew that if this repair was going to be a significant investment, we would just get rid of the car and get something else. 

I called in on a Sunday and talked to Brian. He was extremely nice, said sure, bring the car right in. I found them based on these awesome reviews on Yelp, and had never thought of going to a national branded place like this. I got a great vibe on the phone (where a lot of mechanics lack customer service), and I brought my car over.

They took a look immediately, showed me the issue was with my axle, and I could use new brakes and rotors. Brian took my wife and I back into the office part, outlined the parts and talked to us about his own cars. He completely understood that we weren't looking to make a big investment, and he said himself that if it was too much he would get rid of it. He wrote the quote out, said I would normally charge about 800 bucks...but would do it for us for about 550 because he knew we were just trying to avoid buying another car and he wanted to earn our business.

Great, 550...still a good amount, but Brian handled the whole situation so well that we were very impressed, and knew that we would be very hard pressed to find a better rate anywhere else. We took a few minutes to think it over, and decided to go for it.

Possibly the most impressive part? They had the car DONE in less than two hours. Everything swapped out, ready to drive away, done. We literally went across the street to the mexican restaurant, and by the time we were done it was ready. 

It was the fastest, most efficient, and best priced interaction I may have ever had at a mechanic. Not only did it make the choice a lot easier for us to make the smaller investment to keep the car running for awhile, but they did everything so quick it made the whole process utterly painless.

Thanks so much Brian and the team at Superior Tire, I can gladly say I've found a place I can bring our car anytime we have trouble with it. Customer service + great mechanics + speed + price = extraordinarily difficult to find in the car service world.

Highly recommend this place and I will be back (hopefully not for awhile though)!. La Grande Orange has a little bit of everything, giving you quality, freshly prepared dishes quickly and at reasonable prices.  

It's compact but there are lots of different food stations. You can order breakfast sandwiches at one cashier, pizza at another, salads, sandwiches, cookies, juices and more. They have a modern menu with healthy choice options like Kale and Quinoa salads, Veggie Burgers, Chickpea Lettuce Wraps, along with all your more "normal" food items. 

Commuter Sandwich (Bacon, Scrambled Eggs, Tomato, Mayo, add Avocado on an English Muffin) - I was really impressed with the freshness of my breakfast sandwich. For the main item, I could have had bacon, ham, turkey, smoked salmon or avocado. I went with bacon and they only charged me an extra dollar to add avocado. I would totally order this again.  

They have so much stuff to choose from here that everyone in your party should be able to find something to eat for breakfast or lunch. If you are in a hurry, you can pick up food to go quickly here, or you can sit down and eat after you order and pay as it's a fast casual spot. One of the guys working at the airport Starbucks suggested this place to me and I'm glad they did!. Great vegetarian options, service and atmosphere.  I had the seitan and it was really good.  Great salad, dal & dessert.  Paced well... nothing but good things all the way around for the four people we had who ate dinner here tonight.. Quality sushi, and very friendly people.  Great service overall. The only thing I think would make this place better is a decent lunch time happy hour menu, but overall good experience. I do feel a little bad for them because they picked a tough location that has seen many business closures, its a little hidden in the corner. Some better advertising may be a good idea so we can keep this quality sushi restaurant in Surprise.. Although the wait was 30 minutes it was well worth it and completely understandable for being brand new. Congrats to Rise&Shine for being so busy right from the start! 

Alright well coming from Northern Utah and growing up with a few tasty Home Style restaurants; Rise & Shine has sure taken me back! The quality and flavors of the food are completely worth the wait! Biscuits&Gravy with two eggs! Mmmmmmm!!!!  As I'd like to say I've found myself a Diamond in the Rough. The sausage gravy was perfectly crafted on two very moist buttermilk biscuits. I recommend trying the B&G!!. We were looking for a place in the area to perform a buyer's inspection on a vehicle we were considering buying. Mike and Gina got us in right away and performed a thorough check of the vehicle in a timely way. We felt confident we made a good decision on the purchase and will keep Wilhelm as our mechanic of choice. I didn't mention the inspection was complimentary - thanks so much Mike and Gina.
Dan. Great spa, wonderful massage. The staff were very attentive  and friendly.. This is the type of place that I'd normally wait to review until I've been five or six times.  I'd want to get a wide range of experience with the beers on the menu so I could add some tasting hints (I'm not a professional, but usually I can offer some some sort of semi-educated-sounding opinion), and possibly even add some smaller points about the location that might get glossed over by most reviews.

Can't do that here though.  I tried, but of the three times I've been here I've only been able to sit once.  Even then, at 3:30 in the afternoon, I was relegated to the smallest, most uncomfortable spot at the end of the bar. The other times were so full that there was an overflow crowd waiting for seats already.

So with only one visit under my belt, and who knows if I'll ever be able to find a seat in there again, I have to say this:  Crowded or not, this place is great. The bartender was as much an expert as you'd expect, and willing to take the time to explain things to visitors like me whose only knowledge of French is what they piece together from the signage around the city. The beers are all their own, and there is plenty to choose from. 

It's definitely worth the trip (maybe a 10-minute walk from the metro station?) out there to have some excellent beer at a friendly establishment.  If there's room for you.. Stingray's happy hour menu rocks. They have sushi rolls and appetizers for $4-$5, plus half-priced sake (all sake, which they don't explicitly state on the menu), beer, and wine. I recommend the shrimp shumai dumplings for an appetizer... fantastic. 

The sushi was not the best I've ever had, but it's definitely more than acceptable. The Stingray Roll was my favorite. Service was great, and so was the ambiance. I'm excited to go back when the temperatures cool off and we can sit outside and enjoy happy hour for three hours.. The best grilled cheese ever, high end food and drink, bar setting, loved it.. Food was amazing.  Service was fast and friendly.   I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Pittsburgh.. New location on Peoria, just off the 101.  It's on the north side of the road, just east of 91st Ave. (old Fazolis location).

Same great fast Mexican food, good prices, and they were busy on the opening day today (May 5th, of course!).  Hours seem restrictive, 7:00 am-8:30pm but oh well, it's great Mexican fare at unbeatable prices.

Butter tortilla, anyone?. This restaurant is gem!  The service is excellent and the food is delicious!  We came from LA for the fair and we arrived on a Friday night, then we came back on a Sunday night with friends!  We will keep coming back every year! That is how good the whole atmosphere was!. Sushi is excellent, service spotty at times.  Staff is friendly and accommodating to allergy request.  Recommenced!. Great advice and great work at a good price. So I come here all the time and I love it. It's always clean and everything tastes great. The mushroom masala is to die for. I would recommend this place to anyone!. Sean was outstanding from the time I called the store to getting my turn signal problem fixed and explaining what was wrong and what he did to get it fixed! This was the best experience I have had at a car repair place since I moved to Vegas 2 years ago. Incidentally, a car repair place down the street wanted to run a electronic diagnostic at a cost of $96 before they would even tell me what the problem was. It turns out it was just a loose electrical connection which was fixed in a few minutes by this Auto service center! I am definitely going to be coming here for all my future car needs. Great customer service and very reasonable in their pricing!!. Great place!  They have their own line of cigars that are made in the Dominican Republic, several blends and multiple sizes, they have some flavored and sweetened cigars as well. 

The people there are always friendly as easy going.  They have a pool table and shuffleboard in addition to several seats to sit down and enjoy your cigars.. Super Weine und liebevoll zubereitetes Essen. Mike Z. and I took a trip over to Houston's last night, the latest stop on my Arizona Tour de Steak.   I'm trying to eat at a new steakhouse every time I come to Scottsdale, and Houston's was the latest stop.  

The first thing that stands out is the service, our waitress was phenomenal and she always checked in with us at exactly the appropriate time.  I tipped accordingly due to the service being so good that it stood out.   

The actual meal was good, it was better than Modern Steak but under Mastro's.   I had the New York strip and I was impressed, it was cooked exactly how I ordered it and had an excellent taste.  No issues with that, or the salad I started out with (classic Steakhouse salad with champagne vinaigrette.)    I also had 2 glasses of wine, both were drinkable but forgettable.   

Overall I had a great experience, and would recommend Houston's if you are looking for a good meal with excellent service.. They were very knowledgeable. My laptop had many issues, and they were able to fix all of them in a timely matter.. Review is for lunch.  Mon Ami Gabi is a chain restaurant with like five US locations, but its aptly located in Paris Hotel and Casino overlooking the Bellagio Fountains and Strip.  Reservations get you an inside table in this enormous restaurant. For patio seating, its first come basis.  Restrooms are accessible to the casino sportsbook outside the casino, underneath Eiffel Tower.

For food its a solid 4 stars for me.  Mussels were excellent - plump, juicy, and just 2-3 un-opened.  Their wine-butter-garlic sauce was unbelievably good.  Bread dipped here is far better than fries.  Fries were crispy but a bit oily and too skinny for me - I can barely taste any potato.

Their Bloody Mary cocktail is definitely on the spicy side, and it had two good-sized olives for some additional tartness. I got the version with Grey Goose vodka.

We also tried their salmon salad - a wonderful combination of spinach, kale, blueberries, walnuts, and a nice citrus dressing.  Salmon was perfectly cooked and there was lots of it!

I ordered the pulled pork banh mi - it had a ciabatta bun I think and good spiciness from Sriracha and acidity from pickled veggies.  It did come with those oily, skinny fries however.

For desserts, the profiteroles comes three per order and was a nice ice cream sandwich held together by cream puff pastry.  It was drenched in fudge and was just so decadent.  Highly recommended.. Came back for my bday, for the free entree. If you sign up for their emails you will get a free entree on your birthday!  The restaurant was clean, service was good. I will be back, I feel like they listened to my cries. The manager was around, friendly, and on top of everything.. Small place located north west of Spring Mountain and Decatur intersection, in the same plaza as the popular Monta Ramen, Raku Japanese Grill, or the elegant Kabuto sushi. 

Over the years, I haven't been much of a japanese curry lover but I will still eat it periodically. This place is small but is managed by a very friendly, welcoming staff. 

Very small, defined menu highlighting their main focus, curry. Plain curry, chicken katsu curry, or pork katsu curry. Of course there are other things on the menu or add ons but in this review, i will not get into it. On the back of their menu, they list every, or almost every spice they use in the curry, as well as a brief description of each of what it does to help you (health wise) 

On the table, there are 7 different bottles. Of course the normal salt and pepper, but they have 3 others. The normal 15 spice blend they use in the curry that gives a mild spiciness. As well as a medium and a hot blend of spices. The final 2 bottles are the usual red pickled ginger you see normally in japanese restaurants and i believe was pickled baby onions? not sure. What i had found out which was a nice touch was that they do NOT put the ginger on the side of the curry, where most restaurants do. I thought it was a nice touch because i am not much of a fan of ginger, overall. 

This first, and only visit I have made (so far), i had ordered chicken katsu curry. Presented in a normal fashion. Round plate. 1/2 white rice. 1/2 katsu covered in the curry sauce. 

Of course, first thing i would taste is the curry sauce. Nice brown color. Very smooth upon taste. Very flavorful. Can taste a lot of the spices but with a small kick from i believe either paprika or cayenne (i dont remember the list of spices they had listed). This place makes their curry sauce well. 

Besides the curry sauce, of course they had the katsu. Wasn't too amazed by this though. It was cooked thoroughly, but maybe a little too long. Meat was dry and the thickness varied greatly on the piece of katsu. The breading was a bit stuff, and not "loose". Not sure how to describe it. What i believe to be a perfectly made katsu is an even thickness cut of meat either cut or pounded thin, breaded with panko bread crumbs and fried to a golden brown, long enough to be cooked but fast enough to still be juicy, as well as have a flaky crust. 

Price pretty reasonable. $4.95 for the plain curry. Then additional $3 for chicken katsu, $3.50 for a pork katsu, and they had other things. 

But aside from the katsu, maybe they are still correcting themselves on the timing, ill give them another chance in the future, the curry is great. probably the closest to genuine japanese curry you will find in Vegas for now. Good place to visit but remember, space is limited, to maybe.. 20ish seats total.. Great people who are very good at teaching yoga and helping you get the most out of your practice. They also provide great workshops to help with hard poses. I highly recommend them!!!!. Great food! I am really happy this location opened. Though I understand it's still their first week open, I have been three times since they opened and every time the line to order is really long and slow moving. It wouldn't be a huge problem if it was long and moved fast but it moves so slow. Granted the employees are still new and learning. I hope they figure it out so the ordering process will be faster. But overall , the food is excellent and priced well. I was sad to see so many people walk in and then walk out once they saw the slow moving ordering line.. The food is good, and the service is decent. And the food comes out fast. This is perfect for that little snack in between gambling.... Massive, fresh, tacos. Massive, fresh, burritos. Awesome pastor and carne asada. Tasty horchata. Good prices AND they don't charge extra for sour cream, guacamole, and extra salsa! This is my go-to joint for quick tacos and burritos.

Update: So apparently they changed things a bit since I was there last. They now charge 75 cents for guacamole, which is a bummer. Other than that it is still the same old deliciousness.. I left town for a month for work. I trusted my last pool guy would continue my weekly service even without me being able to verify it was being done. I come home and the pool is a mess, algae'd over, and just awful. I immediately turned to yelp and was recommended Husic's RX Pool Service by another highly reviewed pool company on here. Husic was able to come out on super short notice (called him at 3pm, he was there by 5 same day). He charged me an extremely fair rate, cleaned the pool, did all the tests I asked for, came back the next day to check on the pool and clean my filter. Super knowledgeable guy, and that's why he's earned my weekly pool service duties. I highly recommend Husic!. Amazing selection of craft beers at the little bar in the corner, as well as good beer selection in the retail to-go sales.  Same good food & beverage selection as any other big Whole Foods.  Love this place.  Parking never a problem either.. Dr. Liu and his staff are a revelation.

The thorough and efficient work by Dr. Liu along with the fantastic customer upkeep through the staff (as well as the general charm and comfort all around) makes this dentistry practice one for the books. These guys are truly a practice that could render dentophobia extinct.

Moving forward, I look forward to seeing Patrick & company. It doesn't matter if its cleanings, fillings, or root canals because you will have a great time and will be clamoring for more oral hygiene!. Sunset park is one of the biggest in the valley, it has a very large walking area that must be at least a mile and a half. They do events on the lawn near the fountain and they are a lot of fun. My girl and I went to a concert here and it was excellent!. Let me start from the beginning here. I was searching for a good date spot for me and my gf. I have dined at most of the finer restaurants in Vegas. But I wanted to try something new and by far, this was the best reviewed spot. Only thing that turned me off was that it was in the middle of a mall. NOT AN ISSUE. I requested the 'Tree House' and that is where we were sat. Once in there I completely forgot I was in a mall...it was romantic and beautiful. Our server greeted us and asked if we've ever diner here before....we both responded "NO". We were then treated to a 5 minute explanation of their entire menu. Based on other reviews...we started with the shrimp cocktail and I suggest you do the same. Very unique and brilliant presentation. My gf had the Fillet of Arctic Char "Oreganata"..we both LOVED it. I had the Bone In Rib-Eye. Cooked perfectly. Delicious. For sides we chose the mac-n-cheese(not bad, but kinda bland to what I've had at comparable restaurants) and the brussel sprouts...fantastic. We had no room for dessert. Cocktails were good....coming from a guy in that business. As we left, EVERYONE thanked us for coming...from busser to manager. That was impressive. I even woke up the next morning to a voicemail from them thanking me for me business and hoping that me and my 'beautiful' gf had a great time; and that they hope to see us again. ONLY complaint..and this is being picky: when our bread was dropped off(with multiple choices), it was just thrown down with no explanation as to what was what. But this is a must go!. Came here for a benifit for a friend of a friend.  Live band was playing and the beer was cheap and cold.  I will have to stop by earlier in the day to try out their lunch.. Great Service, easy to schedule and view pricing on their website.  I had a question about their service, so I called, and was able to talk directly to the owner.  Great experiences so far.. If you live in or around Phoenix and you haven't been here...you should be punched in your face. 

Not your average breakfast; my chorizo biscuits and gravy was flat out delicious!! The creme fresh over the potatoes was a nice touch and helped cool the heat just enough. The spice is clearly there but not overwhelming. 

Don't let my score of four stars fool you, the food is out of this world. The space is a little cramped but the service was good.. Habanero salsa was fantastic and it is available solo, and not just in the salsa sampler.  Happy hour had some very reasonable deals for a high end resort such as this one.  Glad to see numerous craft beer options.  Margarita good for happy hour, but pricey any other time.  Very polite, professional service at the bar.. Awesome place
Nice food
Good Service
Low price
Nice place to have some food when come to movie at Harkins Theaters...Loved it!!  :). great place for atmosphere and interesting food.     if you can, sit at the chefs table !      Razz, the chef owner, will continue to place spectacular food in front of you until you can not eat another bite.   He is guaranteed to entertain you through the entire dining experience.  One of the great chefs in the valley!

Razz always offers interesting wines and amazing desserts!

in scottsdale, this place is a must !!!. The western is awesome! The regular is quite big. My daughter had the junior which is a perfect amount.. Weather your #paleo, #glutenfree , #vegan or just want great #healthy you can't go wrong with Lyfe delicious and healthy food.. place isn"t new but a gem . wait service is on top of it and food is awesome. we will be back.. I used my Living Social voucher today and I think I'm ready to be a repeat customer.  The inside is nice with a minimalist, zin zen zang feel.  The only thing I did find a bit annoying is that in the waiting area, there is a small couch and one chair that appears to a massage chair or some speciality chair  that nobody wanted to use, because it looked like abstract art.  It was busy and it seemed like a total cluster f...k.  The staff were friendly and gave me a quick tour.

  I appreciated the tour and was impressed with the tub room as that looked really relaxing.  As far as the hair care area, it was no big deal.  When it comes to hair I go more for the za za zu, then the subdued.

  Shannon was my massage therapist and she was really good, not a lot of idle chit chat and see seemed very focused which I enjoyed.  I tried the hot stone upgrade but was not really impressed.  It was nice, but I think my expectation anticipation was higher than what it panned out to be.  Shannon did a great job and identified a couple of problem areas. 

I did like the fact that they explained their memberships that are available and am thinkiing about the lower end one.  They wanted to get me set up on two week massages which I thought was excessive.  I think with massages, its not the same as something you can see like hair, facials, etc so I think the benefits are probably more noticable after time.  

I did see they offered the HCG also there, but I wouldn't be surprised if a person starts seeing it in the grocery next to the canned meats lol so that did not seem like a big deal.   

This is a nice place for the price and worth checking out.. My sister Irene V. set up an event for me to meet some people this past Wednesday and it was fantastic.  Although the restaurant doesn't normally accept reservations for the bar area they made an exception for us.  We had a robust group of 20 and the bar staff (specifically Heather)  made the experience extremely enjoyable.  Heather took the time to explain the oysters available for the day in great detail as well as recommend several items as this was my first visit.
  My oysters arrived promptly and was quickly joined by my beer.  Every time my glass was empty Heather seemed to materialize with a new beer.  "Carlos, would you like another Alaskan?".   -Yes Heather I would.  :)
   Food item of note was a pasta dish called "gnocchi"  It was a small bowl full of heavenly goodness suggested by Irene V (as much as I hate to admit that).  Good lord.  Small pasta with a creamy filling sitting in a thick butter sauce that is without a doubt the best pasta dish I have had in years.
  The restaurant had a classy feel but mellow enough that I felt quite comfortable in khakis and a polo shirt.  There is a full bar with upscale alcohol and a knowledgable staff.  I thought the vespa raw oyster bar was a cute touch and the ladies in the group of course took a photo of them sitting there.. Ordered the Man V Food favorite: 

On the bottom, a thick bed of bacon mashed potatoes. On top of that a nice big biscuit covered with gravy. Then fresh spinach, tomatoes and thick cut bacon. Two fried chicken breasts smothered in mozzarella, and scrambled eggs on top, all drenched with copious amounts of gravy. It was outstanding. And no, I did not finish it. I left two slices of tomato uneaten. No sense being a damned pig about it.. Lori went out of her way to make sure that we had a great customer service experience while at Zoe's. Thanks to people like Lori and Seth those of the reasons that we come back to Zoe's in fashion square mall. This review is the very good side of a very bad experience.  I'll simply start by saying THANKS Legacy for being honest, efficient, and affordable.  

Here's the story.  We just purchased a home.  One of the lender requirements was for an air conditioning unit to be replaced, which was done.  A couple days after closing, we noticed that the air was no longer cold in that unit and it wasn't cooling the house.  Fortunately, we had also purchased a home warranty.  I contact the warranty company who sent an air conditioning service man out from a company called Air One.  He was polite, but couldn't do anything because our compressor was iced up.  He told me what to do and said they would need to come back out.  It was a Friday, so for the weekend we had no AC in the lower part of our house.  Anyway, Monday, Air One sent another crew out.  You can read my review on Air One, but let's just say, it was not a good experience.  They tried to sell me compressor cleaning for $285 on a brand new compressor, then cleaning on evaporative coolers for $485 for each unit inside the house.  Additionally, they said the compressor needed 10 lbs of Freon at $55.00 each and told me I had to make a decision right then.  I sent them on their way, and searched Yelp.  

That's where the story gets good.  Legacy was highly rated on Yelp and overall, I tend to try to find companies others have had good experiences with.  I wasn't disappointed.  They sent their technician out who was friendly and very professional.  He quickly assessed the problem and confirmed that the evaporative coils were indeed plugged, restricting the airflow, and was causing the icing.  When I asked how much, he said it was $120 (AirOne was $485).  I asked him to complete the repair, which he did quickly.  I also had him do the upper unit, since I was still going to be money ahead, which he also did.  Then, I asked about the Freon.  He said my air was blowing at a very cold temperature and that I didn't need Freon.  So, $240 later, I have cold air on both levels and everything is "cool".

If you want HONEST, EFFICIENT and AFFORDABLE air conditioning service, I highly recommend you use Legacy Air.  I also strongly recommend that you NOT use AirOne and I've suggested to my home warranty company they also not use AirOne.. just have to write a review about harolds sons transmissions I met harold and he quickly gave me a quote for a clutch assembly installation and a time frame for when the work would be completed.  He not only has fair prices he also stands behind his work. Im so thankful i was able to meet harold and his son michael they both helped me out of a tough situation. If you have any transmission problems go to harolds sons transmissions they are a honest family owned business.. Highly recommend! As a health nut and gym junkie I've been to my fair share of supplement shops and by far firebird nutrition has been my greatest experience! Not only was the owner knowledgable and friendly but for the first time I didn't feel like I was getting up sold. Highly recommend and will definitely be buying all my supplements from this store in the future.. 1) I'm a little surprised for a school the size of ASU this place has as few reviews as it does. 

2) I'm shocked that the FTR Sun Devil Stadium was a fellow Golden Bear (I was at that game as well)!!! 

I actually have quite a history with Sun Devil Stadium. My dad is a proud ASU alum so growing up I regularly went to two or three ASU football games each season. I even worked concessions there my freshman year in high school, which happened to be the year the Super Bowl was played here as well as the Nebraska/Florida national championship game. 

Since 2003 the only times I've been to this stadium is when Cal comes in to play ASU in football, and although this is still a great stadium IMO (I've been to 8 of the 10 Pac-10 stadiums and this is one of my favorites) it's definitely lost a bit of its luster and could benefit from a face-lift. 

It's picturesque for sure (I know that ASU likes to promote the fact that it's "the only college stadium situated between two mountains") and pretty easy to enter and exit (you might not think this is a big deal but try going to Memorial Stadium in Berkeley). The last couple times I've been here I've pretty much came to the game as it was starting and stayed in my seat the whole time except for pee breaks (bathroom lines aren't that bad...say you what you want about "trough" style urinals in the mens room, but they keep the line moving!) so I'm not sure what they've done with concessions. But from what I remember in the past, they do have more than your typical hot dog and pretzel stands. I think they have local vendors as well selling shaved ice, flavored lemonades, and "gourmet" popcorns. You don't find these kinds of concessions at all college stadiums, so the variety is nice. 

The aluminum seats can be horrible when it's hot (luckily my last couple times here I've experienced nice weather) & the student section can get obnoxious (and no ASU students you shouldn't take that as a compliment...the "insults" (if you can even call them that) are so juvenile, and definitely go along with ASU's image as a university that doesn't produce the sharpest tools in the shed. 

All in all, however this is still a great stadium to watch college football!!! I look forward to coming back the next time my Golden Bears come in and stomp all over the Devils. Come on ASU fans, even YOU have to admit things are looking pretty grim for you right now.... Dined here on 7/23/12 as a party of three with 8:00 PM reservations.

This was my second dining experience at Charlie Palmer Steak and the food did not let down.  I started off with the butter poached Alaskan King Crab Spaghettini.  Simply put: outstanding.  The noodles were cooked perfectly, crab did not have that sometimes-salty seawater flavor - instead it blended perfectly with the sauce (which was not overly added).

For my main course I chose the dry aged 14 oz bone in New York strip.  The steak was cooked/seasoned perfectly and loaded with flavor.

Dessert I opted for a molten chocolate soufflé with a side of Gran Mariner sauce.  Again, the dessert was made perfectly and the complimentary ice cream cookies were an added bonus.

As for the food, I cannot say anything bad at all.  This would easily be a 5-star review if it were not for the service.  Our server, who complained loudly to the hostess about being overworked, sat us down and stated "I will bring bread over immediately".   His version of immediately meant us asking three different servers for bread and another server twice for drinks.  After our server took our order, we again had to ask multiple servers for drinks and we did not see our server until after our main courses came out.  The last part of the lack of service came when one member of our group noticed that her steak was overcooked (there was no doubt about it as the dryness of her steak could be observed visually without even cutting into it).  She asked for a second steak - no problem was the response.  However, some random server came out and proceeded to tell her that the lighting gave the steak the impression that it was overcooked - even though she took a bite and saw that it there was no red (she ordered medium rare) in the entire steak.

Again, Charlie Palmer steak - 5 stars for the food.  The lack of quality service knocks it down only 1 star because the food was so good.  Highly recommended.  Can't forget that the live band took my request and played it!. Think I found a contender for where I will spend my Thursday nights!  Been on the search for a decent trivia place and found that VBGB has one on Thursdays.  We took a risk and it was a good experience, the questions were tough, but not too tough - and #1:  NO CHEATERS allowed.  There have been way too many places that let people just use their smart phones to look up answers - what's the point!?!  yes, you may win a gift certificate, but that's not in the true spirit of trivia.

Though this place is in the NC Music Factory and a bit hard to use in a sentence, VBGB has a lot of potential.  The out door patio that is overlooked by the historic JFG coffee sign was great (that's where trivia took place).  There is no wait service, so you walk up to the bar windows and order...  pretty good system and it gets you up and out of your chairs for some mingling.  The food is the same way, there is a line to order and then they give you a number where they bring out your food once it's ready.

I only ordered a pretzel, but it was pretty darn good.  I had a huge stein of beer though and that got me through the rest of the week (well, one more day).. We started with the Samosas and the sauce that accompanied them was fantastic.  Like, eating spoonfuls of this stuff after the samosas were gone, good.  The goat curry was spicy as requested and went down great with the fresh, warm bread that came along with the food.  Everything else was great but I got the impression you can't really go wrong on this menu.  Awesome, totally awesome.. Great spot for music ! This really helped me to get my fix for a mid-western style neighborhood bar. The blues band (Billy Ray Charles) is top notch. The drinks are reasonably priced and well poured the times I have been there. Still have yet to had the BBQ but it is on my to do list. I will be back for sure. The bar staff has been good and attentive. Mondays a swing dance club meets there and are a hoot to watch. Really makes the atmosphere electric. Weekends the blues band starts later so plan accordingly unless you are in for the long haul. i hope to bring some more friends there and for now this place ranks as my top spot to see blues music in town.. If you are looking for a bike come here, they have a million of them. I was looking for low price and clearance items but they were a few these but not what I was looking for. This is an urban location in an area heavy with bike lanes so I would expect them to be proficient at repairs. After looking at the prices I understand why my bikes are 10 and 20 years old. bikes are expensive! Am I showing my age? So if you need a bike this is the place to go! Do not go to walmart! Go here and get a bike that fits right!. Bravo!  Viva Portofino's!

Great pizza, truly a gem in the Arboretum neighborhood.  The fact that the price is reasonable only makes the value that Portofino's gives you that much better.  Service is great, and the Italian accent coming from behind the counter is like a warm blanket reassuring you that your food will take longer than usual, but will be worth every extra second you have to wait for it.

It is crowded, be warned!  Don't expect to swing by on a Friday evening for a quick bite.  Such is the price you have to pay when your food is so delish!. Great lunch,  great staff, and CLEAN!. I first tried these sandwiches several months back. Since then have returned several times to try different ones and to bring family members with me. 

I agree with some of the reviews - the ordering process can be a bit confusing - but its not that bad - and lets you customize your sandwich which is great. I can be a bit repetitive when you pay, but I'm ok with that. It does take a bit longer to get your sub, the first time I went I didn't allow enough time before my appointment and ended up taking the sandwich with me. 

The best part is - the taste. SO yummy. Probably my favorite sandwich place in town. The bread is delicious and I've tried 3-4 different subs and they've all been pretty damn good. Get a free cookie when you return if you fill out their survey online. Cookie is warm and super gooey good.

I'd give it 5 stars but my two complaints is that its too far from where I work and live - and the place is a bit small and can be crowded while you wait for your sub. But that's because they are so good.. Nice caprese good pizza.   Great atmosphere.  A short walk from downtown Phoenix.  Open late.  I would come back. Been coming here since it opened.
Love the Mom and Pop feel.
Taste of home.
Food is great. Staff gets to know you and remembers you everytime you come back.
I come get breakfast here a lot.
Big Island Scrambler is my go to plate.
Burgers are great for lunch.
Funny seeing some people complain in other post.
I've never had 1 problem here and the service has all been great.
I recommend coming here.
#RaiderNation. This was the place I went to with my friends when we first got into good beer. Their brews are very good and their food as well. Their fries are a little weak, just run of the mill compared to Four Peaks' beer battered fries, but other than that their menu can stand toe-to-toe with Four Peaks. What gives Four Peaks 5 stars and Sonora 4 stars is the fact that Four Peaks' beer is superior and Four Peaks has a great Sunday brunch. But do not get me wrong, this place is worth a visit... many many visits!

P.S. BEST ONION RINGS IN TOWN!. Best. Burger. Joint. I've had five guys, habit, in and out, the hat, fat burger, Tommys and umami. Succulent meat, delicious sauce and best part they are au natural. You can even get a beer or wine. This place is modern , hip and tasty. There is a little bit of hype involved but that is mostly because you need to compare it to the above places not like a $14 burger from a restaurant.  Come on people. 

The kicker is the custard. Holy Mackerel. Crazy good. Had the red velvet and I dream of it daily. So unfair I have to go to the east coast or Vegas to satisfy my craving. 

Please come to Northern California. I'm begging.. A very exciting and high energy German style restaurant. The noise level was a bit loud, so if quiet, intimate dinning is what your looking for, this isn't the place for you. The loudness is what this place strives for. They are pursuing the excitement and environment of what an authentic Bavarian restaurant would be like. Some of the noise and electricity comes from the German stay band and singalong a they ensure. The other noise comes from the excitement of the employees as they try to evoke a party atmosphere.
 The food is as authentic as the environment with items like Schnitzel and sauerkraut and German sausage. Even the German beer was fantastic. 
 Abut pricy but so good.. Went here because I wanted to take my mom since I'd been to the one in San Diego and loved it. Got seated in about 20 minutes, which was pretty good considering how crowded they were and the fact that it was Black Friday. Our food came out pretty quickly and everything was good, though I will say that the location in San Diego was better. While the portions were really large for most places, they were much smaller than the SD location, though that's not a bad thing since there was no place to take leftovers for us and it feels a bit weird to eat a burger with a knife and fork because it's literally impossible to pick it up. Service was a bit slow, but not annoyingly so. I wouldn't be afraid to hit it up again the next time I'm in Vegas.. Loved it!  We were seeing Ka and wanted to find a place in the MGM for dinner.  My wife doesnt eat red meat, so Craftsteak wasnt really ideal, except for me!  My wife and I decided to go with appetizers for dinner.  We got the charcuterie plate,  tomato fondue, and crab and lobster rolls.  The charcuterie was good, but would have been better if it came with complimenting cheese.  The fondue was basically a grilled cheese sandwich with a tomatoes and cheese fondue dip... pretty tastey.  The crab and lobster rolls were also good, but a bit bland.  We saw people getting the lobster pot pie, and that looked pretty amazing.  Maybe next time... we also shared for dessert the beignets  with chocolate and salter caramel sauce, and the banana tart.  Both lovely.  The service was excellent too, a combination of formal, polite, and friendly.  I think I could easily come back and try everything on the menu.  The pot pie looked great, a table next to us had yummy looking burgers and frites,  and steak would probably be an easy winner here.  So many places in Vegas to choose, but you won't be disappointed with Nobhill.. Very good!  The Bulgogi beef was  very tender and super flavorful. Our lunch came with an appetizer sampler with tastes of different Kim chi items.  We also had a comp.  1/2 order of pot stickers from the Yelp check in and free cinnamon & sugar chips.  The lunch menu was a great way to check things out,  with several options under $8. We'll be back.. One of the nicest indoor ranges in town.  The staff is very helpful and safety is the up most importance.   You can defiantly feel comfortable dialing in your weapons there.. I have been shopping here for years.Martin in the guitar dept is awesome!He has treated me like a good long time costumer should be treated!All though I do miss the smaller local guys I think this outfit does a great job overall.. If you need to get pampered in Cave Creek this is definitely the place to do it. We visited by chance recently during a festival held in the shopping complex. The facility itself is a design marvel (designed by the owners and custom built - they own the building) . The owners and really hands on and passionate. They offer haircuts, manicures, pedicures, facials, massages, and a dozen other spa services. Treat yourself to Salon Mila!. "Reservations recommended"...

i was thoroughly impressed with Fogo De Chao. For a place that is basically a buffet with servers bringing you meats to the table.. the operation is well executed. I am no stranger to this style of service as I grew up with a restaurant of this type nearby in California. 

This particular situation was just great all around. Great service, nice salad bar with great items and condiments for your meal, and of course the never ending supply of meats hot from the kitchen.  Steaks, ribs, pork-chops, pork loin.. just a great selection. All perfectly cooked and served piping hot. 

It is around $50 a person, but worth every dollar I believe. IF you get  a chance, I say give it a go! Happy Eating!. Sent a email request responded within min set up appointment got my car fixed will be using anyplace auto from now on. Awesome happy hour. Cheap beer, cheap pizza and shuffle board.

Best part was the SHUTTLE from the bar to Scottsdale stadium and BACK for only $5!!! 

Then you can use that $5 voucher towards your bill later that day! What!?! Yeah we used that sucker all weekend!!!

The wait staff handled all 10 of our drunk bachelor party having asses with ease. It's like they have done it before.. One of the most exciting venues in the east valley. Food was excellent!  We had to wait over and hour to get out bay to start playing. We felt it was worth the wait.  Since it just opened, it was jam packed.  The waiting staff was extremely unorganized.  We had to wait 30 minutes just to place food order.  Overall,impressed this entertainment venue. Will be visiting many times in the future.. I have looked for years to find a honest automotive repair shop in the Vegas area and have finally ended my search.  I have a 87 Monte Carlo SS that needed an engine swap.  The lowest quotes I got were in the $2000.00 range just to start then add all the little things the price goes up.  Jason at Aloha started at $1000.00, so I gave him the job.  This was not a normal regular swap due to some performance parts.  His shop had to customize some parts, do some research on how to fit everything back together and they even went so far as to paint some of the old parts to match the new engine.  His $1000.00 fee stood and only charged extra for parts that I did not have or were bad and had to replace.  Car is running like a champ.  Why anyone would go to another shop is beyond me.. I have dined here numerous times.  They have a wood oven.  The pizza and olives are amazing!  The pasta has been consistently exceptional. The hostess is extremely nice and professional.  Bartenders and waiters are very friendly.  They have a great selection of beer and wine.  The atmosphere is great.  An overall exceptional place.  I highly recommend this restaurant!. Clean, great service, great smiles, and the cooks know when it's time to take it off the grill... Eating breakfast starting my Saturday with a great Denny's start thank you.. very popular spot for happy hour. it is off the strip at a shopping center. seats were hard to find during happy hour. food was okay. desert was really good. They have a great menu which focuses mainly on spicy Sichuan or Northern Chinese cuisine. I come to this place quite often for the eggplant with pork and black beans. 

Yes it's in a basement, but don't let that turn you off. It's fairly clean with a chill and relaxing atmosphere. The prices are reasonable. The staff are friendly, helpful and bilingual.. Finally I got to go to one.  I'm just visiting the mesa area from Utah  and had the chance to go. Utah gets the advertising, but not the bar... Which sucks.  I got to say, this place was pretty cool.  The food was very good. The games were awesome and great fun. It was expensive yes, but not as bad as you would think. Dinner for 2, expect about 50 bucks. This is a gorgeous restaurant in Chandler.  It has a patio, bar with several TV screens tuned to sports, and a large set of booths for the anyone who wants.

The service was rapid and friendly by pretty waitresses.  I had a spicy salad one night and grilled salmon on another.  Both had unusual ingredients like toasted corn and were delicious and a great portion size for me.  I will definitely return to this grille for the bar and the rest of the menu.

It seemed like a good place to have a party on the patio, an intimate evening with a date, and anything else.  The music was loud enough to enjoy, but much quieter than most places with a sports bar in them.. I don't have much to add -- the other reviewers nail it. The long wait is crazy for a lunch, but that's a well-established fact and there's no reason to gripe about it. Try every meat -- the fatty brisket is incredible, and the smoked turkey is amazing.. Stopped by for a drink stayed for two and wanted more need to go back and try food. Staff was excellent funny and friendly.. I will put the time to fully explain why this place is way too cool for it's own good. But for now, just understand that it's amazing.  If you don't believe, check it out for yourself, go on a monday or tuesday and get their 2 pitcher / 1 pizza combo for $20 and the mouth dropping experience will begin.. Absolutely fabulous!  My wife and I ordered a combination platter so that we could sample different menu offerings.  Included were barg (fillet mignon), chicken fillet, and koobideh (ground lamb roasted) served with basmati rice and grilled tomato.  The menu stated that it was for 2, but the platter, really a large tray, was enough for 3 or 4.  We ordered a side of cucumber yogurt which was perfect with the main course.  It came with tiny currents and finely chopped pistachio sprinkled on top--absolutely delicious as a dip for the warm pita bread and meats.  We also recommend dolmens, stuffed grape leaves, as an appetizer .
We were seated right away, waitress was friendly, food came out hot and well presented.. Really great experience. Alex was my bartender and waiter and he made it a really pleasant experience. I had the "twenty year famous shrimp tacos" and they were excellent.  I live in a coastal town know for its seafood tacos and these, in Phoenix, were as good as any I've had at home.  With a side of green chili Mac and cheese and a spectacular dinner salad (nice touch with the dill) ...awesome meal. I have to admit I've been here a few times before and have not felt as satisfied, but tonight... Wow. It's what have you done for me lately, right? Lately this place rocks.  Btw, the guy next to me just got served the 1/2 chicken and it's pretty dinky. Looks like half a Cornish hen.  Maybe avoid that.... Pleasantly surprised by the good customer service! There's no shortage of boba shops but this one is by far the best. 

Friendly staff and nice decorations - feels welcoming and not generic. Unlike most other places, they are patient to answer my questions as I figure out what I want and the difference between the drinks. 

Drinks are good. In particular, I really like the nata (pineapple/coconut) jelly option! Some other places have a cheap version that feels rubbery and tasteless, but this one is higher quality and goes well with any drink. You can tell the ingredients are better here (versus many other places where you can tell it's just water and a scoop of colored powder). I like how you can customize the amount of sugar - especially since sometimes I'm on a diet and sometimes (most days) I give myself a free pass. 

Special mention for being innovative and offering dairy-free drinks, as I've never seen this offered for boba before. Many of my friends are lactose-intolerant, so it's a wonder nobody thought of this before. 

Bonus points for the convenient power plugs under the seats for your phone or laptop charger. Located next to Monta ramen.. Came in for lunch today! Wow I didn't realize that cuttlefish did lunch! The service was absolutely amazing , Chris took great care of us ! Now to the part I enjoyed the most the food! I had the albacore sandwich !!!!! Holy geez that's the best sandwich I have ever had. The ginger sauce on it was heavenly !!!! We will be back this week for restaurant  week     !!!!!. Awesome tapas style food. Had some really interesting fusion of traditional pub food and contemporary tapas. We ordered 6 dishes among 3 people which was just right for dinner. I really enjoyed the pork belly corn dogs and salmon belly tacos. There was a watermelon salad served in a plastic bubble which was cool to look at, but the conttrast between the sweet watermelon and vinaigrette didn't work out for me. There was a tater tots dish as well that I thought was good but too heavy for tapas. However, I do appreciate the attempt to try out these flavors.
Also, the beer was amazing. The IPAs were $5-$6. Didn't get a chance to try anything else but given how often the tap changes I would love to go again.
All in all, great food for tasting with even better tasting beer, with a clean indoor setup and plenty of outdoor seating.. Hair cut and old fashion shave!

Honestly i really didn't want to cut off my curls. But i was so curious to get an old fashion shave...

I went during lunch, so concerned of a wait time, i called ahead. NO WAIT. I still suggest calling, cuz they only have a couple barbers working at a time. *Even if there is a wait, just go next door to paradise bakery and get a cookie.

You walk into a very nicely decorated shop, with TVs at everystation (Feel free to ask the barber to change the channel) My barber, foreign maybe turkish guy, was not chatty. But with a hot towel around your face, you really don't want to chat.

He did a great job on a plain hair cut, spending lots of time on making sure both sides of my head are the same length. The close shave felt very good. My first time. He explained each oil and cream that he put on my face and spent extra time at the end going against my face to double check missed spots.

I used to go to expensive salons, but this is a great substitute while i am crushed for cash.. I've only been here for lunch, but it's one of my favorite spots for a business lunch. The interior design is very well done, which is rare for a locals' spot. You expect that from a more expensive restaurant on the Strip, not somewhere in Spring Valley.

The food is delicious and the flavors are well developed. The menu is a mix of Jamaican and New Mexican cuisines, so there's something for everyone. My favorite item is the New Mexican-style slow-cooked pork bowl, simmered in New Mexican red chile with two over-easy eggs and served over rice. The portion is huge and I always have leftovers for dinner.

Prices are fair. You get a Strip like experience without the crazy prices of the Strip. It's not exactly cheap either, but considering the food, ambiance, and service, the prices are acceptable.. Went here for breakfast. Food was great. Service was great. Price was great. I've heard this place is very lively at night as well. Would definitely recommend.. Good beer good food good people and good environment how could you go wrong. Have you seen the selection of Bourbon here??  They got the ENTIRE Pappy Van Winkle line and the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection available here.  So I've been on a bourbon craze lately, and this might slightly skew my opinion of this place, but that's absolutely amazing that they can offer this selection of bourbon for the public.

Ok, aside from that, this place is quite the hole in the wall.  The bathrooms are tiny, it's in the basement of the Italian Workman's Club, it's dated and it can get very crowded and loud in there.  But the pizza is awesome and there's a great selection of booze.  We tried an olive oil based pizza with bacon, spinach and goat cheese, and we loved it.  Our friends had a sausage, green pepper and garlic and it was awesome too!  Service was top notch as well as our waitress was checking in at the right moments.

probably my only complaint was that we ordered an Old Rip Van Winkle 10 year neat and what we got was maybe an ounce to an ounce and a half of the bourbon.  seemed kinda stingy on the pour, but I get it, it's a rare bourbon.

So while this is a whole in the wall, the food and the drink selections are quite worth it, just make sure to get there somewhat early as it can fill up fast!. wonderful restaurant! the atmosphere really adds the charm to a diner done Vegas style! and the wait staff is super attentive. 

food was excellent and are served in incredibly large portions, walked away very full!

didn't get a chance to check out the bar area, but definitely next time. 

my only qualm about this place is the crazy wait! I think because this place is so hyped up and the food is good, more people tend to gravitate at the usual meal times. I think next time we'll try going at a time that isn't so busy. and since this place is twenty four hours, I definitely seeing another trip in the near future!. While we were in Vegas, our friends recommended coming to Bouchon. It was actually already on my list, so we agreed to meet up with them at 12:30 on Sunday for Brunch. They said they'd get there early to get in line for a table as they don't take Brunch reservations. At 11:40 we get a phone call as they already got a table, so we rushed to get there as soon as possible. Luckily, even though we got there at 12:30, they weren't rushing our friends out the door, so bonus points for that.

I had the chicken and waffles. I've never really eaten chicken and waffles. So far I've only had posh versions, and the one at Bouchon did not disappoint. The chicken was nicely cooked with delicious gravy. The vanilla butter was great and the syrup on top was nice. Everything went so well together, and I just ate the whole thing. The other half ordered the croque madame and it was delicious. Unfortunately he wasn't feeling the best due to a bit of overindulgence the day before, so he didn't enjoy it as much as he probably would have liked.

I also had a Bloody Mary and a hibiscus bubbly drink. Both of which were really great. The coffee was delicious too. So no complaints on anything really. Great service and great food, and everything I could expect from a Bouchon restaurant.. Others have already said it, but to describe Amy's in one word: Standby.
This is the place that you go to have lunch when you're not really sure what you are in the mood for, when you don't have much to spend, or just want something relatively quickly and fresh.
The bar is also a great place when you just want to have a chill night of hanging out and getting your buzz on. Or even just a great place to start out a night of grander debauchery.
This place was such a "go to" joint for me that I actually had to make a conscious effort at times for it to not be the first place I suggest for lunch or drinks.
And the bar itself is just so improbable. The place is designed as a super-casual lunch spot with your standard fast food-esque tables and some gaudy pastel decor. But then there's a nice carved wood backbar off to one side. So things can seem a bit surreal when you first start drinking there.
Prices on everything are a bargain. And I seem to recall them having a really good long island, if you're into that kind of thing.. I shop here all the time; I love this store and have never been disappointed! Produce and meats are always fresh. Staff is awesome too!!!. I went to cancom with my macbook pro which had been water damaged. I now realise that is is closed but there was a sign on the outside saying that their technicians are now working at a shop on Forrest Road called SimplyFixIt. There is a web site at http://cancom-edinburgh.com

I took the macbook to them and they were really helpful. Now that they are not tied to Apple's repair prices they were able to fully restore the laptop at a great price. I can't recommend them highly enough. 

The phone number on the poster said 0844 822 6072. Call them and I bet you never wonder about Apple not being in Edinburgh again.. I've got quite a decent knack for being able to appreciate the grimmer things in life, and when it comes to Cameron Toll, my grimness radar goes off the chart. The actual stores themselves aren't anything bad, just the usual high street names with an emphasis on functionality rather than fashion, but it's the hideous building itself that does strike out at you.

It's amazing to think that when I was an infant, these late 80s / early 90s monstrosities were considered the cutting edge of modern architecture, yet nowadays they're viewed with the same contempt that befalls postwar tower blocks and sink estates. They still make me a bit teary-eyed and nostalgic though.. Good quality, the staff is nice, all the rolls I have tried have been great so far. Good happy hour menu. Chosen for it's proximity to the Venetian poker room, I had a pretty good meal. Sat at the bar and the enthusiasm of the barkeeps was infectious. These guys were handing out samples of all sorts of different beer and whiskey, and had a story to tell for each one. Food wise, it was all pretty good. Started off with the fried pickles, which, I am obligated to order whenever it is on a menu. Cmon people, it's fried pickles. Anyway, they were tasty. Ditto for the Eggplant Parm on Ciabata bread with a basil pesto. Delicious. I can't explain why I got good service and others didn't. Maybe you have to sit at the bar.. Oh man! This place is awesome! A couple of my coworkers had been to a different location and were quite unimpressed, but this location exceeded all of our expectations. If you've heard bad things about the other location (which I can not corroborate) then it is still definitely worth your time to come to this location.

There were four of us, and we tried four different things. The beef and chicken curries is what I got, as well as pita chips and hummus. The curries are amazing, and the hummus is very good. It doesn't take top spot for best I've had, but it's definitely ranked very very highly. That was quite surprising for me, as this is basically Chipotle for Mediterranean food. I didn't expect hummus this well executed from a place like that. 

I think that actually sums up anything else I could say: I had a certain level of expectation for this place and it blew that expectation out of the water. The food was great, worth well above what they're charging. This is restaurant-quality food at fast-food prices. 

I will, without a doubt, be back here quite regularly. I can't think of a better endorsement than to become a regular.. Great customer service, and my car came out nice and clean. I would only suggest fixing some of the vacuums. Also note that they only take cash, but there is a Chase bank and Bank of America right across the street in the Fry's parking lot.. This place is a little gem in a strip mall! Don't be fooled by the outside, go inside and you'll be impressed. The food is awesome! Best pizza in town! I love the house salad, as well as the antipasto salad.
Try the Gorgonzola ribeye sandwich, it's great!. This place is sure to, and as I'm seeing below, cause plenty of controversy. It's well known concept is obviously slow cooked all organic foods. Not the kind of life I'm personally going to lead but I applaud the effort and enjoy trying something outside the box. 

Harvest is the kind of place you only go for GRPs. Graduations. Rehearsals. Parents. It's an experience almost more than a dinner. Very much involved in the ingredients the preparation, technique, pairings as much as the food. It's for those particularly who are more open-minded. I would say do not come here if you don't have an adventurous or willing palate. You won't like it off the bat and then you'll knock all the efforts put in as just "weird food in little portions." 

My experience here was a mix of those who thought it was expensive dog food and those who acted as experts in eating foie gras and squid. Coming in I hadn't had the chance to try some of these fine dishes, while I tried the more exotic options and didn't really care for many of them, I didn't much anticipate to walk away loving duck liver. But as I said GRP. Graduations, Rehearsals, Parents. This is the opportunity to try these things while you can in a smaller city. 

If it's your dime and you're more concerned about getting something you know you will enjoy definitely get something more fit for you. I'm just saying don't knock it if you are ignorant or close-minded. I loved the butternut squash soup shot I had. And I had several bits of fish dishes I really enjoyed. The cuts of meat were also flawless. 

This was probably the longest meal I've ever had. From the amount of people present, to the courses, to the pacing of the restaurant. Sit back in your fine apparel, talk with those around you, take it ALL in, savor it as one of the more elaborate meals you may ever have. The food is amazingly refined, I may not like liver and shellfish, but this restaurant's food is not the result of a golden calf effect. Really make this most of this if you have the chance, look at the menu beforehand, look some things up, ask questions, and try as much you can. I wish more restaurants could inspire this amount of passion in people.. Excellant food, authentic mexican food that is always great. awesome service from the staff, a must goto and try, have tried just about everything on the menu and everything is awesome!!!. Very interesting little cafe tucked away in the Old Port.

Well worth a visit. The decor is small and intimate: this cafe can only suit maybe 5 people or so. Flyjin is more tailored to a coffee on-the-go, as their service is fast and the coffee is better than other options in the area.

Very distinct lattes. Extremely thick and creamy, quite different than most cafes in Montreal who usually treat the frothing differently. 

Definitely worth a try if you are in the area. They also have little muffins and treats, as well as fresh-squeezed orange juice.. When we stopped by this restaurant for quick breakfast on our way to the airport, we didn't expect to end up giving 4 stars for a seemingly typical American breakfast chain, but that's because the food quality was well beyond we could've ever imagined.

We had Blueberry Pancakes and Denver Potato Pancakes Combo, and both items were amazing. The concept, presentation and taste went all above average.

If you're still in doubt, look at my pictures - and decide if you believe me or not.. LOVE LOVE LOVE this store. I herd of SuperDry back in 2006 when I went to Ibiza. Speaking of which I still do have the OSAKA 6 t-shirt that i purchased back then. Still looks good like the day i purchased it.

The style is very me. Its japanese inspiration but by a British company sprinkled with american vintage. It has all these elements you think it would be a disaster but I actually love it!

Sizing here runs a little bit smaller than most US brands so make sure you try on the clothes first before purchasing.

The sales people are little bit pushy here but I believe they may work on commission. They approached me about 4-5 times asking if i needed help. They let me know the promos going on even made me persuade on purchasing more items.

I ended up walking out with a messenger back that had the SUPERDRY logo on it and a jacket that had a very small super dry logo on the chest & I am super happy with my purchase and will be most defiantly coming back here. I know their items are have high quality and will last me for a very long time so I dont mind paying a little bit more for the SuperDry brand.. One of the better hotels restaurants are good, but a bit pricey for what you get. The beach was nice, but too small for how popular it is. $20 for sunblock crazy. They didn't have restaurants that you could just grab and go, like a subway.. Stayed at TI the weekend of 7/22-7/24. If you drive to Vegas like I did you will find parking at the hotel very convenient...the parking garage is located right off the freeway at Spring Mountain Rd....no hassle dealing with Las Vegas Blvd. traffic.

Check-in process was very long around 11:30 AM....roughly 30 minute wait.

Rooms were decent for $75/night. Beds were very comfortable and the room was clean and looked newly renovated. TV was on the smaller end but then who watches TV while they are in Vegas. 

Casino was nicely laid out and I was always able to play one of my favorite games.

The location of TI is in a nice spot if you like visiting the hotels on the north strip. There is a tram that will take you to the Mirage and from there you can easily walk to Caesars or Bellagio. You can also leave TI and walk to the Wynn or Venetian which is across the street. 

Overall the hotel is a great value. Other hotels in this area are asking $200+/night (weekends). This hotel works well if you are on a budget and looking to crash somewhere comfortable. If you want the complete experience like ultra clubs and great restaurants you might want to look elsewhere.. I am always happy when I go to the this Jewish resturant.. I consider this place the find of the year for me.  I have been traveling to Pittsburgh for business and staying at the larger hotel chains which were just ok.  This place was so much nicer and friendlier.  It's a hidden gem for sure.  It provides amenities that you would expect of a chain hotel including free wifi and direct TV and free on site parking.  However, no hotel has the personal touches such as the friendly staff of Sean, Whitney and Chef Winston (who will make your custom breakfast to order).  And this place even has a small movie theater.  

At first glance, their web site appears that this mansion is better suited for weddings and the like.  While it does appear to be ideal for those types events, it's a great place to stay for business travel when you are tired of the hotel chains.  It was also less expensive than the major chains in the area.  This place works for business travelers looking for the comforts of home.  It's a great location within walking distance to Walnut Street and its restaurants, pubs and shops.  

There is no hotel bar to hang out in or room service or a fitness center, but I found that the rest of the amenities and comforts of this place make me not care or even need those things.  They call this place a "bed and breakfast" but it is the nicest, most impressive bed and breakfast I've ever seen.  I will be staying here for all my business travels to Pittsburgh.  Well done!. I stumbled upon this place last night. I can't believe what I heard from the owner. The outstanding folks from SuperFarm SuperTruck make more than just their amazing Superfarm ice cream...no no no...they make a whole slew of flavors. Guess who has them? YUP! Lets Melt down to the specifics and discuss the new gem ice cream shop, Melt.

~The Good~
Well, the owner is good buddies with the owner of Superfarm. I just realized Udder Delights is also under their tree of ice creameries...so if you like Udder Delights, check this place out! I just love the randomness of it all. A guy opens up a small, nondescript ice cream literally next  to Lost Leaf, and he just so happens to have local, amazingly tasty ice cream from Superfarms...GO FIGURE!!!  They have a ton of flavors, by the way. Right now they have a ton of sherbets and fruit-flavored ice creams. Of course they have the usual staples like chocolate, mint chocolate, and so on....but come on, they have Superfarm, which if you have yet to have it, is a hazelnut chocolate ice cream, with Nutella added. This ice cream alone is a reason to come here. Instead of tracking down Superfarm's truck or heading to Gilbert for your fix, COME HERE! The owner's also, are very relaxed, its a small business to the T. They also make smoothies out of the farm-fresh ice creams they have. Just come and try this joint, you will love it.

~The Bad~
There really isn't too much. It is not in the nicest building, its in a re-designed home, the kind your used to at Roosevelt row. They do not have seating inside, so it may get hot if eating out in the sun. Its more of a cash n' dash if eating during the day. I see this more of an optimal spot for later in the night, if you ask me. Its in Roosevelt Row, and that is not everyone's cup of tea. If you are the person that like add-ons and toppings, they do not offer that to this point, so keep that in mind if that is a must-have.

~The Down Low~
Overall, this is a solid 4 star spot. The amazingly kind and homely (the good kind) service, assortment of flavors, freshness of ingredients, and the fact that the ice cream is locally made all add up to 4 stars. Is it a swanky  parlor where hipsters go to? No. Is it a shop that serves ONLY local and fresh farm-made ingredients? YES. Even most local in-house shoppes fail to use such fresh sources. Melt is also open from 12 to 12...ALL DAY..So you can get your Melt on whenever you want! Melt gets the Jefe Seal of Approval! Come and enjoy!!!. Three couples for dinner on Father's Day.  First impression - a beauticully done atmosphere.  The bar/lounge area just invites you to sit down.  So we did - 8 oz pinot grigio and 8 oz  chardonnay (house) = $23.  Huh?  So I started out with a bit of a chip on the shoulder - house wines should never be that high, and these were unknown brands.  And I kind think offering a choice of 5 oz or 8 oz is unneeded. Go with an 8 oz, get the price into the $7-$9 range for the house.

Ok...now we went to the dining room.  Very nice.   This place is so like a hunting lodge in the north woods.  Great waitress and good service.  And the food was excellent and the prices were on the high side, but not upsetting at all.  By the way...go for either one of the salmons...or for a huge salad..  I'll vouch for all of them.  Wish the filet was a little more juicy - it was med rare and plenty of red, but not much juice.  If you order the spinach side, be sure to ask they go lighter on the garlic!

So now, the score.  I'll go with 4.  Still upset about the wine, but not enough to ding them.. This is one of the better places (if not the best place) in Las Vegas for all-you-can-eat sushi, and I eat here most of the time when I want sushi.  The fish has always been consistently fresh and good over about a dozen visits for both dinner and lunch, generally a step above, say, Kabuki, but not as good as, say, Sushi Gen in Los Angeles.

About $24 (lunch) to $28 (dinner) gets you an hour to order from an extensive menu of sushi basics, a wide variety of rolls, and non-sushi items like seaweed salad, baked green mussels, chicken skewers, and fried oysters.  Beverages not included, so add a couple bucks more for that, plus tax and tip.

Service here is generally good, with everyone friendly.  It does get a little crowded on some nights, so if you go for dinner, be prepared for a bit of a wait as they don't have a ton of seating.

Tip: Rolls can be ordered as half-orders, giving you more room to try different things!. The perfect location to take a breather, sip on an espresso, and enjoy a beautiful day in Montréal. 

This popular spot can also be a great place to get some work done if you've grown tired of working in a monotonous office... There's just the right amount of background noise to keep productivity flowing. 

The little "side" terrace (mainly bench-style seating beneath an awning) can potentially be a good area to get some fresh air if you are lucky enough to nab a seat that isn't surrounded by smoking customers.. This is the place we get take-out from, more than any other.  The reasons are numerous, but some favorites include the broccoli with peanut sauce, pineapple curry, their soups, their fresh spring rolls with either shrimp or tofu, and don't forget to add on the cucumber salad (something like $1.50).  If dining in, the soup is a double treat because of the presentation.  If you like spice, they'll accommodate!  And kids (at least our little kid) always love eating here (or from here).. I hope they make a chain in every single city in the states. That's all

We went here for lunch on a Sunday before driving home. It was packed and was confusing at first how to order. There are different lines for different meats you want, so make sure to look at the lines and plan accordingly. It really helps if you have a friend with you to have the friend wait in another line. After you get amazing tacos with variety of meat, you go to the counter to pay.

I highly recommend Adobada, Carne Asada, and Chorizo. They are amazing tacos for very cheap that every taco-lovers should try. Very good service. They charge $20 for delivery and $2 each pound. They took my laundry at 9 AM and delivered back at 3 PM. Clean and fold very good. Highly recommended. Fast, honest and friendly service. New Manager With a  new attitude. I guess they brought their best to warmsprings just brakes. Best service ever thanks!. Excellent food and service!! Our server, Paige, was very helpful and friendly. Pizza rock is definitely a weekly favorite!! I highly recommend the Michigan cracker crust pizza and the fried green tomato caprese salad!!. Wow! From the ambiance of a very old restaurant with huge amounts of charisma, to great service, great oysters, fantastic smoked salmon and fish chowder..Fisher's is an awesome place to dine.. Un petit joyau caché entre ridgewood et côte des neiges, excellents brunch, bons lunchs, des viennoiseries et une très belle décoration. Vraiment content d avoir trouvé un endroit comme ça a côté de chez moi!. Amazing and Fresh!!!  My favorite place now. Small dining area. Great staff. Great service. The Spicy Beef noodle was Perfecto!!!  Their Signature Beef noodle dish was Very Very Good too. Steamed Chicken dumplings were Yummy!  It is worth the wait if the dining area is full. Sitting at the bar was easy and quick. Loved watching the Chefs making the noodles. Pretty sure the owner came by to check on us as well. I highly recommend to everyone!. Allgemein
Vor einem Kino-Besuch wollten wir uns noch ein gutes Abendessen in einem schönen Ambiente gönnen. Das "Watt's" erfüllte uns diesen Wunsch. :-)
Bedienung
Die Bedienungen waren sehr freundlich, natürlich und aufmerksam. Ich fühlte mich als Gast sehr gut aufgehoben.
Das Essen
Ich entschied mich für das "Cordon Bleu", welches sehr schmackhaft und gut gewürzt zubereitet wurde. Die Wedges und die Creme waren ebenso lecker. Wir werden dem Restaurant wohl noch einen weiteren Besuch abstatten müssen, um unsere Meinung zu festigen. ;-)
Das Ambiente
Wir haben uns bei diesem Essen nur im einladenden Außenbereich aufgehalten. Dieser liegt abgeschottet von Straßen in einem schön hergerichteten, großen Innenhof. Dieser hat dennoch echtes Potenzial - daher einige Ideen zur Optimierung: Eine einheitliche Ausstattung verwenden, ein bisschen weniger eng anordnen und ein paar kleine Abtrennungen (schmale Pflanzentöpfe) zur Schaffung einer besseren Privatsphäre.
Sauberkeit
Zu beanstanden gab es in Sachen "Sauberkeit" nichts.. Flying in from San Francisco and running on fumes, I was desperate for a pick me up.  Went to the Chocolate bar outside of the restaurant and needed a recommendation for something heavenly to drink. The lady put together a Chocolate Granita.  Wow, a smooth creamy cold tasting hot chocolate. Incredible.

My buddy the next day was dying of curiosity and picked up a slice of the chocolate pizza.  Deelish...nice and warm too.

This, and we haven't even stepped into the restaurant yet.  Next time in Vegas we will.. The burgers here are ok - not amazing, but good.  Toppings/varieties seem pretty average as well.  Nothing to write home about, but nothing negative either.

This place would get a solid 3-star review, but the soda selection gives it another star.  They have several refrigerated cases of soda by the bottle, different varieties from all over.  One entire case is just different kinds of root beer, including one I can hardly find out in AZ, "Dang! That's good!" butterscotch root beer.  This place is worth a visit for the soda selection alone.. We eat here quite regularly. It's a chain, so this location is similar to the rest, so if you have been to another location and liked it this one will not disappoint. It's right near Green Valley, so nice if you want to go shopping then grab a meal it's very handy.
The food is consistent and quite good.
I actually order two things which are no longer on the menu (Crispy Wontons and Chicken in Black Bean) and they always make them for me, which is fantastic.. My wife and I found Stew Keene thru Yelp! reviews.  We highly value the opinions and experiences that others share on Yelp. My wife tells me all too frequently that I have becomes OCD when it comes to researching any and everything that is important (to me or us) whether it is a big purchase or even a smaller one that really matters to us for whatever reason.  In this instance it REALLY paid off for us.

I contacted Stew and had to leave a message. He returned my call in about 5 minutes.  I told him that we were in the market for a house and told him our base price need and general location.  I also told Stew at the beginning of the call that we were interviewing 2 different realtors and would decide in the next 48 hours who we would use.  He was very attentive and then began to ask intelligent, thoughtful questions to get a better understanding of our needs.  At the end of the call, I had a really good vibe about Stew and was ready to make my decision.  Being the good husband that I am  I told Stew that I would talk to my wife and let him know... Needless to say, we went with Stew and we really could not have made a better choice no matter how many Realtors we interviewed.

We had a couple of very specific requirements that were must haves in our home.  We wanted to be close to my wife's job, we had to have a house with two living areas, we had to have a pool.  All of those seem pretty basic... Stew set up a website portal for us that he would drop houses onto that he thought may meet our needs.  He also encouraged us to drop houses onto the website.  He was very thorough in his selections as well as reviewing what we placed on there as well.  He would never presume to remove a house that we put on the portal but he would on occasion tell us the price was higher than it should be, the neighborhood was sketchy or any other piece of information that he knew.  If we still wanted to see the house, he was more than willing to show it to us.

I realize this is getting very long so I will shorten it just a bit.

Stew must have physically shown us 50 houses over the course of 3-4 weeks.  He never lost patience and he would not let us get frustrated with the process.  He was literally there for us at any time we had a question or need.  We finally found the perfect house about 1 mile from Old Town Scottsdale.  He was able to negotiate a great deal for us and was very attentive to us and helped to lessen the pressure that comes with this final piece of the process.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND STEW KEENE.  You will not go wrong with this guy. Knowledgeable, witty, patient, resourceful and an all around top notch professional.. Chicago tradition spilling into Pittsburgh. Gotta give them points for that!. For my first Banh Mi experience I don't have much to go on but this was pretty dam good. I had the grilled pork Banh Mi. The flavor on the sandwich were unlike anything I've had before but no complaints. I'm not a fan of bread but the bread was perfect. I could use a bit more meat though. I just like a lot of meat on my sandwiches but still a good sandwich. Spring rolls were perfect also. Peanut sauce wasn't too thick either. 

I'll definitely be back to try the different sandwiches, rolls and the other items they have to offer.. A-1 has been providing us exceptional service for years!  Ken and his team have been absolutely wonderful to work with!  Thank You!

Cragin & Pike, Inc.. If you haven't tried thsi place, you are really missing some good food.  Cooks who know how to cook southern style and do a superb job of it!. Loved this place. It has a limited menu, but what they have is great! I ate the Okonomiyaki and was in heaven, I felt like I was back in Japan.. Six yelp stars Fantastic! !  !  *** ***

Like a significant first date I was here for the first time in September 2010.  A friend took me here and he ordered what he usually got  #40. Bun tom, Thit Nuong, Cha Gio (until this meal).  I ordered the Lemongrass Curry with Beef (having no idea if I would like it).  My friends dish came out first and I took one bite and said "wow I wish I would have ordered what you got"!  He said something like "I told you how good this place is".  Then my dish came out and I think the next several times we both ordered the Lemongrass Curry with Beep though it is very tasty with Chicken too. 

More than half of the time I get the Lemongrass Curry and my second Favorite is # 41. Bun Tom Nem Nuong Cha Gio: Grilled Pork, BBQ Shrimp, Pork Meatball, Imperial Roll, Carrots, Minced Peanuts and Cilantro on top of Vermicelli Noodles, Mint, Cucumber, Bean Sprouts with a Fantastic Fish Sauce.

About half on the time I also get the Wonton Soup!  The Canh Chua Ga (Sweet and Sour Soup with Chicken is also good though it is entree sized.  The Vietnamese style of serving Coffee with Sweetened Condensed Milk is my Favorite and Dessert I like here.

The Service is Perfect!  The Decor is umm, some may call it a hole-in-the wall and OK maybe it is... Who Cares - The Food is Spectacular!

The neighborhood used to make me want to write a fast song and wait to sing it in my car!

Lemongrass Curry is a "Gateway" Curry so watch it!  EAT it and see for yourself!. I was surprised, the food is really good, big portions, very nice flavours and good combination. Outstanding fish & chips , well buttered and not oily. Bloody Caesar was good, well spiced , good ratio of vodka to juice. Kids meal of good portion. Service was fast and reliable. Welcoming stuff and nice decor. This is my second time here and i would definitely recommend it.. Have you been to a restaurant in Vegas which was somewhat quiet? Ever? One that had a spectacular view of the city in the distance? One that offered wonderful service in a highly romantic atmosphere? All while you drank Chateau Montelena?

Come here and don't feel bad about skipping the tasting menu. Order from the regular menu, order a nice bottle or two of wine, and immerse yourself in the company of your dining companion. You will be very pleased you made the decision to come here.. Food always tastes great here!! I'm not a big breakfast eater, but my friends and family who are say the food tastes great and portions are huge. 

Sandwiches-great. Matzoh ball soup with chicken noodle is spot on. Just like my Mom taught me to make. 

Servers are awesome. Jaques is always, kind, friendly and polite. The older lady that seats you needs to smile a bit (please take note; you are the 1st impression of this place).. I'm usually a critic of Sam Fox's concepts but lately I'm developing a sympathy for them and Flower Child is helping.

A down to earth unpretentious cool spot with great service and good food for a fair price, what else can you ask for?

I had the asian avocado salad and the madras chicken curry.

Both pretty good. A little too much kale in the salad and little avocado if you ask my opinion, but all in all pretty solid.

I'll be back for sure.

Cheers. A little stuffy.Prices are high but the food is worth it.. Chris and Adam really hit it out of the park with this one!  Ambience is fun and original, great vibe.  Drinks are excellent.  Food is fabulous!  Get the bone marrow, then do a luge shot out of the bone.  Gnocchi was more than I expected for sure.  Makes me wish I lived in Phoenix!  Great job!. Fresh ingredients, non-greasy base, tasty tomato sauce. A trinity of excellent factors to make great pizza. It was very reasonably priced too.

We order three XL pizzas. Two veg and a pepperoni. All three were great.. I went based on Laura D's recommendation and this could be the equivalent to bread heaven!  One thing my wife has been commenting/complaining about has been the lack of quality bakeries off the strip.  Well...she plans on coming here at least once a week now.  We just went with the baguette ($1.40), a cinnamon roll,  and a mixed bag of bagels.  The bagels were just ok but I am spoiled after living in NYC but the first 2 were fantastic.  I guess I am going to have to start running more often!. The only major critique I can offer is for more space. As a regular, I like the space a lot during every season, but it can crowd easily. Especially during the outdoor farmers market. I'm also not a fan of the smoothie texture, but they are still yummy. Coffee, tea, baked goods are all locally sourced as much as possible (WI) and baked in Milwaukee! Cheesy biscuit or cinnamon rolls are easily my favorites.. Love the reclining seats in the movie theater and like the assigned seats. Bowling is fun with the family. Indoor golf is a quick, cheap escape from the heat in the summer. Facility is clean and service is consistently good.. When I was a kid, my dad was a baggage claim agent at the Greater Cincinnati Airport.

This one time...LOL...the Jackson 5 were in town for a concert at Cincinnati Gardens.and when my mom and I was picking up my dad from work, a limousine pulled up and guess what...The Jackson 5 got out!

I jumped out of my mom's car and bolted towards the limo, when I was damn near ganked by a security guard and got a tongue lashing by my mom.  She went ham sandwich on me.  LOL.

I've been a Jackson 5 fan all of my life and subsequently a Michael Jackson fan, and until my 50th Birthday, I'd NEVER been to a single concert...until now.

Okay, it wasn't an actual concert, but it captured the essence and spirit of one my favorite artists of all time.  The people at the Cirque de Soleil went the hell off on this one!  Bravo!

Michael Joseph Jackson is THAT dude, and they put him on blast - in a most literal and profound way!  The dancing, the music, the acrobatics, the lights, the tributes...man, shut the front door - this was dope!

If you're in Vegas and don't go see this show, shame on you bros.  That's all I have to say about that.. My fiancee stayed at an Air BnB just around the corner from this awesome basement jazz club during our short sojourn in Montreal in October. We didn't make a reservation and were extremely lucky to have shown up early enough to get two seats at the bar for the show that night - a tribute to John Coltrane's A Love Supreme. It was freaking incredible - really inspired performances from all the musicians in a cozy, intimate venue that just heightened the experience. The food was also delicious and the drinks tasty (perhaps a little stingy with the whisky pour). Overall just a fantastic evening out in the plateau and definitely a highlight of our trip.. Came in on a Thursday from out of town and loved it! Great tunes, great games and alright drinks. The drinks were pretty pricey but I guess it's a club so it's to be expected. We will most definitely be back!. Good Pho. Really friendly staff. Got the medium (aka small) combo, which was plenty of good. Beef ball was excellent. Cost $8. 

Ordered unsweet tea, which was swill.

Quick and good. Small place, but I got a table with no wait at 1230.. One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. The food is great...the ambiance is fantastic... The view is superb... The service is state of the art!!!! If you love Italian and want a place that has a classy...but busy...happening feel try Magganio's!. This is the best shop in town. Just took my 3rd car there and have recommended this place to multiple friends. Top quality equipment, top quality service.

You get what you pay for and if you go with these guys, you get the best. I've been a customer since 2007 and plan to be for a long time.. This is my go to las vegas drunk spot. I've been to this place every time I've been to Vegas since that fateful day we accidentally stumbled into the eclectic hallway with records all over the wall. Seriously, I went to this place every single night the last time I was in town. The wait is always crazy...but I always leave satisfied. If you can get the pizza with sliced meatballs, pepperoni and ricotta you are lucky. Thats my favorite. You can get it with garlic too. Its probably not worth all the time I've wasted waiting in line for a slice...but its a Las Vegas staple for me and my friends. A little on the expensive side but hey, it is on the strip. I will def be back.. I stopped one rainy night because the outside looked very interesting being an old firehouse in the strip. The inside didn't disappoint from the food and wine to the service. It has very relaxed and European feel to it. I look forward to my return.. Awesome pizza! I like the personal size with mushroom and sausage for lunch. Closed on Mondays.. I will drive across town for Las Palmas tacos.  (Grocery store, too.)  Only possible ding is that they don't always have their pork tacos - those are amazing.  Barbacoa's always available, though, and it's almost as good.

Tip: Just found out today that you can pay for tacos inside with a credit card if you're low on cash.  (They'll mark it on your receipt to show outside.). This pizza place is not like the others. This is not pizza you get when you just don't want make dinner for your family. This pizza is expertly crafted and they have very created recipes. My two favorites are the Italian stallion and the honey Chile pizza. The honey Chile one is the most perfect session of spicy and sweet. You will forget that you are even eating pizza.. The Montelucia resort is a beautiful property kind of tucked away in a high end part of Scottsdale. The rooms are very spacious, beautifully appointed , and some have really cool Camelback mountain views. The resort plays up the mediterranean/moroccan theme rather well, and the grounds and overall ambiance reflects this. There are some really laid back firepit areas near the pool that provide for a truly relaxing time. Overall it is a really impressive property. One of it's best features is their spa, Joya. Hands down one of the best in the valley. They offer great happy hour specials daily, which is a great selling point for me. Definitely highly recommended.. This place is the best!!! Markus was very helpful and fast! Definitely recommend this place if you need jewelry/watch repairs!!. Just like I remember from my several visit in Jersey passing through on my way to North Carolina many years ago. Fresh fast and delicious!!!. It's the only place in town for everything gluten-free, and it's good. It's so good, thankfully I'm starting to find their products in other stores like Granola's on Shea near 70th. They have more of the bakery's stuff than say Whole Foods which has had their bread for awhile. Get the chocolate doughnut. Get it.. Tried this place for the first time tonight and was very happy we did. My wife usually hates when I order pizza but she actually loved the new york combo pizza. We ordered the 18 in and it was huge, the three of us only ate half and we were stuffed. Guess I know what I'll be eating for lunch tomorrow!  We will definitely order delivery from them again.. Great bar tucked away from most others. The atmospher along with the staff is second to none. cheap drinks and a good time. Good place to go an just relax with a beer and some good company.. If you've ever sat in the waiting of a dental office thinking to yourself, "what were they thinking with this decor..." well this place isn't one of those type of offices. Pearly Whites is the most beautiful, uniquely designed dental office I have ever step foot in. Not only is it a wonderful on the eyes, Dr. Nguyen and her staff are amazing. She takes the time answer all of my questions and the staff is always warm and personable.. I completely forgot how awesome Batch was until a recent trip back to Madison.  I was pleased that they finally relocated to the bigger storefront, which to me meant that they'd likely have more goodies to offer.  I was not disappointed.  I've had numerous great items in the past from Batch, from their baguettes to the popular monkey bread.  One of my favorite pastries since I was a kid was the "morning bun."  I was like a little kid in a candy store when I saw that Batch had one of their own on my recent stop.  As what Corey D woul say, "son of a batch!"  This big buttery ball of goodness topped with gooey caramel may have been one of the best morning buns I had ever eaten........believe me, I've eaten many.  This one may actually rival Simma's in Milwaukee.  This alone would warrant 10 stars, but damn Yelp only allows five!  I need to try one of their savory offerings and a loaf of challah the next time I'm in town!. I didnt think id be eating Korean food in las vegas.  Glad to have tried this place (found it via yelp).  The food was great and the side dishes were also great.  This place is authentic Korean.. This place has helped downtown Chandler become a great place to hangout at on a Friday or Saturday night!!

I have lived in Chandler all my life and downtown Chandler was never a place to go on the weekends, or any day really. However, after they remodeled and San Tan came in, Chandler has been more and more increasing in its popularity.

I have never been to San Tan, and the place not be packed. However, no matter how busy it gets, the service is always great. 

The beer and food selection is also top notch for a brewery. In fact, their hummus platter rivals even the best greek places in the valley in my opinion.

No matter if you need a place for happy hour or even dinner, San Tan is a great place to go.. I was looking all around for dvd repair service for my xbox games, but couldn't find any shops for that around.  These guys will repair your disc like new for $3.  
Thanks. Great food!  Kafta and Falafel are spot on and I have traveled in the middle east.  Food is great and the service is even better.  They have hookah too!. So I came in and got a Facial/Wax from Robin, and it was amazing.  I was so relaxed and my skin and eyebrows were on point after.  Facial and shoulder message was very good.  The music and atmosphere quickly put me in a relaxed mood, and all the tension just left my body.

I will come here again!. Atmosphere is very cozy.  Everything looks very modern and clean.  Quality of food is very good.  Everything is very fresh. Wait staff is very friendly and on top of things.  I would recommend to anyone. This was the best meal I have had since moving to Arizona.  I ordered the Vitello Marsala.  It was delicious.  The appetizer was wonderful.  The house Chianti, fantastic.  And the signature Tiramisu?  Exceptional.

We were the only ones in the small dining area...so of course we got terrific personal service.. Great beef kabob, kibbi, beef shwarma, and chicken shwarma.  Rice had nice flavor, and Arabic salad was excellent. Will be back!. I think Luke's is great.  Best Italian beef I've had in the valley.  

I moved here from Chicago about 4 years ago and although I haven't been on a mad hunt the whole time, I have had some disappointing beefs.  Luke's is by far the best I've had.  

I think the best value is to buy a pound of beef and peppers from Luke's and cook it at home.  You have to buy your own bread, I like sub rolls.  The preparation is easy; just simmer in a pot on real low heat.  Then you can make em as juicy and messy, or dry as you like.  I find buying a pound will feed 3-4 and it's cheaper.

I haven't had anything else there.. In for bowl game. Awesome wings. Great fries. Good beers. Awesome service.  Highly recommend.. Unquestionably the best show in Las Vegas. Period.. I'm all about their red chile burrito.  Green chile and carne asada were pretty damn good too but there's something about the red chile mixed with the gooey cheese, rice, beans, meat, sour cream that hits the spot.  It essentially feels like mexican (or whatever...mexican-american..) comfort food.

Prices are good (comparable to chipotle/qdoba's of the world) but the flavors are not the same at all (burrito house is better...).  They do a good job mixing the burritos here too. No one bite of only plain white rice, one bite just beans, etc. Only complaint is it needs to be even spicier!. My first and only Yelp review.  This place is awesome!  Great pizza, apps, and beer.  Modern without being pretentious.  This will easily be one of the top 3 pizzas in the city.  Try the plough mans platter....fantastic.  Will definitely be a regular stop.. As others here have said you are treated like royalty by the staff.  Of the the 8 in my seating my wife and I were the only ones to go with the basic wine pairing ($120/person), though they had options if $300/person and I believe $500/person.  The wine was amazing and the knowledge of the sommelier was astounding.  

The food is unlike anything you have had before, unless you have been to e' before, and someone from my group had been.  The 26 courses will fly by and the way the staff changes the food will boggle your mind and have you remembering it forever.  Now a few things I didn't enjoy, but I know thats my particular palette and shouldn't be held against e' and it's amazing staff.. great service, great food and great prices.   i highly recommend this place!!!!!. West Wing is a truly great place to enjoy a cigar.  I travel all over the U.S. and make a point to visit cigar lounges in all of the major metros.  West Wing is a best in class for sure.  Best in Las Vegas for sure.  If you love cigars, this is your place.. Had an amazing breakfast here. The fried apple rings, chicken and waffles, and mini donuts with local honey were all outstanding. Hangover burger was also excellent and service was fantastic. Coffee was also exceptional.. Used them to clean an rental property. Cleaner was Maria. She arrived as scheduled and did a great job.  
I Paid extra to have garage swept, windows done and patio swept and it was worth it. 
The focused on the areas that requested and would not hesitate to use them again. 

M. We had not visited a Ruby Tuesday since 2006 when I visited the (now closed) location on University and Mill in Tempe. When I walked into this one, I wondered if it was the same place.

The neighborhood watering hole feel of the old Ruby Tuesdays has been replaced by more contemporary, slightly upscale furnishings including comfy chairs and artwork. The salad bar is still there, though, and looked great.

One look at the menu and you know it has changed -- for the better. They still have the great burgers, but they have been banished to the back cover of the menu. The emphasis is now on healthier but substantial fare like small steaks, seafood, and chicken.

I had the dockside grill trio, including a small skewer of grilled shrimp, salmon, and spicy tilapia with mango salsa. This entree comes with rice and one side. I was disappointed to hear they didn't have the spaghetti squash, but opted for the mashed cauliflower. Good stuff.

My wife had the petite sirloin and fried shrimp. The shrimp were coated in a cornmeal-type batter with some Cajun spice. Great job done preparing it.

The service was friendly and efficient. We'll definitely be back!. This place is brilliant...great sushi, delicious burgers and a wide variety of alcohol.  This place definitely gets busy but definitely worth the wait.  

The staff is always very pleasant and they really care about your visit and food.  I appreciate the fact that manager always makes an effort to say hello and ask how everything is.

The "boxes" offer their not so mini-burger of the week, 4-pieces of ur choice of sushi, cucumber salad, edamame, fries, etc.

They put a lot effort into their burgers creations although the burger itself could have a little more flavor.  The sushi has always been made to perfection.

They have regular seating, sushi seating, and bar seating.. I'm so thrilled to have The Skinny Italian move into the neighborhood and every visit has been great. I occasionally work as an art instructor at Me The Artist up the block and having this addition to the City North family has been fantastic. I love the décor (I want that tin ceiling), the space and the lunch options are awesome.   I die for the Arugula salad and the Panini special is a great deal.  The pasta portion is enough to share with a friend. I want a punch card!. Food was good, but no kids menu and crayons at a "family friendly" restaurant? That's like a sushi restaurant not having chop sticks!. I had the pleasure of having my mani/pedi done by Anh. She was a very nice lady and pleasant to chat with. For an additional $5 I got designs on my big toes. The thing I like most about this place is that they offer three different types of pedicures. A new product that they are offering is a long lasting nail polish. I will be trying this once I have grown my nails out a bit. One thing I did find odd was that ESPN was on the TV. There was a gentleman (assuming the owner) who was sitting in a massage chair and greeting customers. The establishment looks new even though they have been around for 4 years (I asked). The temperature was nice also considering the summer Arizona weather.  I will change my star rating if I determine their services are consistent.. Took the Wife this visit . . . and yes . . . I was kind enough to hold the door open long enough for her to not run head first into the Tiki God.  Had almost as much fun this time as last . . . wife is not a big RUM drinker, but she found one she liked . . . and I stayed with my Malekulas.

Finish with a Bender Ender . . . OOPS this turned out to be a Bender Starter.

Best part was that I e-mailed the owner before we went and got an Autographed copy of two of his books . . . Blue Vegas and Vegas Knockout . . . Thanks MOSS.

Will definitely be back again on the next Vegas trip.. Was too lazy to make my salad this evening so decided to come here for a chop salad not bad it was Tasty. This place looks super small from the outside. It is still pretty small from inside too - probably could fit overall 25 - 30 people. The service was fairly slow but the food was good. It was really fresh. We got some colored chips and salsa. We also got some entrees which was good and we shared among 3 of us. 2 entrees were good enough.. good food, a lil pricey for the portions but def has good flavor and the staff is super nice. I will be returning.. Dear Vegas, don't ever change...I mean, you can change, grow, build, expand, add, demolish, build again...but don't ever change who you are. Be that crazy, strange, over-the-top, fun, and carefree place we all know and love. 

The Signature Towers at MGM...it was a fun time, had a lovely 2 bedroom, kitchen, 3 bath suite with an amazing corner multi-directional view.  Was there for 4 nights for a good friends' extended bachelor party. We hit all the big pool parties, multiple clubs a night, some nice eats, and since we were staying at the Signature...WALKING WALKING WALKING...LOTS OF WALKING.

Notes:
- So Towers 1, 2, and 3...are a LONG walk to the MGM Casino floor (Tower 1 is the closest).
- Most of these 'condos' and suites are owned by individuals or time sharers, and they lease rentership or usage back to MGM Grand for a portion of the profits. Just so you know. But they're run much like the hotels so don't despair.
- Rooms/Suites are pretty big, pretty nice, and contain all the standard amenities.
- Signature Towers has a separate entrance (off Harmon Ave) for cab drop offs and airport pickups, etc.
- There's a few eateries and small pools, and a fitness center dedicated to the Signature, but not like the Wet Republic (crazy party pool at MGM proper), and certainly not the food options as if you walked the mile to MGM's casino and shopping areas.

Great place to stay, we got our luxury accommodations at a pretty good rate, got our exercise in, had a sweet place to crash and recharge...ZERO COMPLAINTS.

ENJOY VEGAS PARTY PEOPLE...!. Very good value. Had a hard time finding it (two other locations listed on their web site and in the GPS were closed). Service and good were both good. Family of five ate for $80 plus tip. Two kids ate of kids' menu and adults had crab cakes, seafood trio and chicken linguine. Then we shared the cheesecake, which was awesome!!. I know this place puts on countless events and is known for its food, weddings, and historic inn, however my review is for one specific service they offer here. It was listed as one of the top ten dates in Charlotte magazine, so I surprised my wife with the Vanlandingham Estate's gourmet outdoor picnic for two. 

I took advantage of a groupon, but for the normal price of $65 you get a gourmet dinner in a picnic basket with a bottle of wine and a blanket and the option to setup your picnic anywhere on the grounds you wish. My wife opted for a spot by the falls and was so impressed with this date. She couldn't stop admiring the beautiful grounds all around us and the idea of being on a classic southern picnic. 

Our picnic basket included a container of lemonade, an entree of chopped BBQ, a side of potato salad, and banana pudding for dessert (Yes Nilla Wafers included). They also gave us a bottle of wine with our choice of red or white. Inside the basket is also a bottle opener and a book of love poetry if you wanted to go the extra mile and recite some cheesiness to your loved one.

This was definitely a memorable date for us and we would do it again in the future. I did ask what would happen if it rained the day I booked our picnic, to which they replied they would setup an intimate area inside the estate for us to enjoy our romantic dinner.. Great  food if you don't mind waiting in line for 30 minutes in front of some hippie do-gooder that is crying because you have too many people in your party. I like the community farming co-op thing they have going too. great place for a family outing.. Excellent hole in the wall Mexican food. Highly recommend. Had the beef tacos and they were excellent.. Hot Things (with Prince's Hot Thing playing in your head):

Christopher Meloni (Hello? Have you seen him in Oz?)
Glee (C'mon you know you love it!)
Betty White's career!

HOT HOT HOT!!! Phoenix is hot. Mercury is hot. Phoenix Mercury is SMOKING HOT! I've had the privilege to meet many of the players and the folks behind the scenes and they are professional, courteous and most of all FUN!!!

The energy and the entertainment at the Mercury games is unlike and energy I've experienced. I've attended hundreds of sporting events throughout my jock heavy life and the Mercury games are infectious. Like laughter. Not poison ivy. 

So here's to the WNBA Champs! A five star organization from back of the house to the court. GO MERCURY!!!. We've done Vegas many, many times staying everywhere. First time here though. Room 33188 closest to elevator and ice machine in tower 3. It's the furthest to the main MGM property but not a big deal for us as gaming was just a small part of our stay. Great gym here. Newspapers are not on your door like other resorts but in the lobby. Room itself is impressive especially as we got it for $90 using the old fart discount (AARP) and they never asked for a card. Was so impressed with the stay wanted to extend 2 more nights. Bad timing as a large group coming in. They offered me one more night $220. Came back later and it was $180 but they'd do me a deal for $140. Thought I was in a car dealership so offered them $120. A side trip to the manager and deal done. The place is impressive. Hope you get a good deal.. We usually stay at Sunset Station Casino across the way for our Lake Mead family trips; however, they did not have sufficient rooms available for our entire group.  Comfort Inn & Suites was a pleasant surprise.  Staff was friendly, rooms and facility were clean; free FULL breakfast and happy hour Mon-Thurs.  Location was central to restaurants and stores.  

Only gripe is that the beds were not quite comfortable but decent and wifi connectivity was poor.  However, we have decided that overall, we prefer Comfort Inn & Suites over Sunset Station.  We will definitely return!. Awesome tortillas, awesome salsa, pretty good selection of Latin American food products (mostly Mexican, but lots of S./Central American and Caribbean).  I'm spoiled from all the Hispanic grocery stores in Atlanta, but this is the best one I've found in the 'burgh.  Prices are average for the Strip and Pittsburgh, but a little high for a Hispanic grocery store.. Shaq was very helpful and help me get my purchase completed in almost no time. I only had about 10 minutes and he was able to answer all of my questions about my new surface pro 3. Super personable and even pretty funny. I would definitely go back to this store for any computer me 4 even for any GoPro camera accessories, they have all of them except for the selfie stick. Get that and you will have your fifth star!. Good food, good music, great spot hang out. Plus you can gamble. Had a good time. Thanks.. the selection is good at this location,  great finds at a discounted price that otherwise would of been much higher at other locations.   Will definitly be back,   love that they carry pepsi max for 99 cents where at walmart is 1.49 for a 2 liter.  snack slection is good.   produce can have issues at times but not a big deal.. Appears to be an older property but I loved the size of my room and the am amenities.  Great work area and I also like the small kitchen.  I would stay here again.. Why doesn't every office park have a quality restaurant?  Come to think of it, why don't I work in this office park?

I have been here a few times before for drinks, and a couple other times for dinner a while back...but restaurant week brought me back.  Vintner Grill is a classy, upscale...perhaps even romantic kind of place with nice decor and a distinctive feel.  I also like that most people are dressed up a bit more than at comparable places...it adds more charm.

I know that I am going to get a quality product here with good service.  The flavors will be solid, but they also aren't going to push the creative envelope too far here either.  I am generally looking for something a little more adventurous/creative when I dine at this price-range, but I'd come back to Vintner for a consistently good meal.

I enjoyed the pumpkin gnocchi, and the parsnip puree, and the halibut.  I'd do these again without hesitation.. I would like to thank Tim in women's shoes. He took the time to bring out multiple styles and fits for my wife and daughter. I think he went way above and beyond. Walked out with four pairs. And the ladies were happy. Thank you Tim.. This is a great little hike with beautiful views of ASU, Sun Devil Stadium, Rio Salado, and more. The top has a lot of rock areas that are fun to walk around. You have to pay for parking but it's not too expensive on Mill Ave.. The food here is terrific. Brad did an incredible job as the server tonight keeping us filled up on drinks and clearing our table. The manager Glen was incredible checking on our table throughout the meal. This is definitely the place to go!!!. Fantastic Food and you can't beat the price! 

Glad I found this place on yelp! I have been about a mile from Tokyo house for over 6 years and just recently started coming year. What a fantastic place and as the others have said, the guy who owns the place is really nice.

The food was awesome! So far I have had their Teriyaki Chicken, Teriyaki Beef, Orange Chicken and House Beef..My favorite is the House beef, with an amazing sauce on the tender pieces of beef and mushrooms. The rice they use is just great too and they coat the rice with the sauce so you are not eating bland rice throughout your meal.

I generally get a large meal for around $6.50, which usually lasts 2-meals and I can eat too. The meals are big! And the quality/price can't be beat....I am definitely going to be coming here regularly.. Awesome.  SO GOOD! We had an event and they catered the food.  It was hot, fresh, and delicious!  I'm going there SOON.  The owner Omar is very kind and great to work with.  He obviously takes great pride in his restaurant, and it shows in the quality of the food.  A must-visit in Tempe!. This place is awesome! The price is right and the Owner is a super cool guy. The instructors are not just knowledgable, but they are actively trying to improve their students' skills. I would not want to go anywhere else to learn this trade.. I had an amazing meal yesterday on my vacation to Las Vegas at protein house. The muscle freak smoothie and several of there meals were amazing. The salmon and quinoa dish is there best thanks for the experience.. One of My favor restaurant. A CVS with liquor? Who can complain?

This is a conveniently located CVS, located near UNLV and Hard Rock. It's a typical CVS. They see lots of tourists here, so they are by nature quite friendly.

I found the alcohol to be reasonably priced, considering its proximity to The Strip.

You can even get cheesy Vegas souvenirs here.

Make sure to have your taxi stop here so you can stock up before you party on the Strip.. We saw the post on Facebook that they've obtained the HALAL Certificate hence we're there today. Mum loves halal food so she appreciates everything that we ordered today. We had satay, pasembur, curry puffs, mee goreng mamak & pandan Chicken. Teh Tarik for drinks.I will update the pics. It was delicious. We're originally from Singapore & of course we love Malaysian Cuisines.  We've been here since 2001 & has patronized this restaurant since the opening back then.  We would like to say thanks for being awesome as always, Tess (Our Server) & Steven (Our Chef). :-)

PS: Don't forget to YELP because you'll get a free roti canai for now.

Halal - Halal is an Arabic word meaning "lawful" or "permissible." Halal foods are foods that Muslims are allowed to eat or drink under Islamic Shariah. The criteria specify both what foods are allowed, and how the food must be prepared. The foods addressed are mostly types of meat and animal tissue. The most common example of non-halal (or haraam) food is pork. While pork is the only meat that cannot be eaten by Muslims at all (due to perceived hygienic concerns), foods other than pork can also be haraam. The criteria for non-pork items include its source, the cause of the animal's death, and how it was processed. - From WIKIPEDIA. Top 10 donut spots around the world... For reals (been to 16 countries). They say all boss donut spots use same recipe, I think this particular location is undermining the rest and adding crack or msg or love potion #9. Really good Buttermilks here and their jalapeño breakfast croissants get any party started right. Found this gem driving back towards freeway from the closest EEgees this side of Tucson (inside joke, for ppl from Tucson). Bobby is a great chef and we love his food but
We didn't go there this trip because his menu seems like it hasn't changed in a couple of years. Boring!. We had a wonderful dinner with great service. The waiter ( Carl) was exceptional and did whatever he could to ensure we had a great dining experience. Plus they had a great selection of wines. Very nice. Highly recommended.. Tuesday Taco Day !  Woo Hoo ! ! ! 
The Cod Tacos were very very tasty.. For nights I want a cheap and quick pie, Papa John's is my go-to. 

This review is based on many orders for pickup. I live nearby, so I have not experienced delivery service. I have never had any issues with this location. This is your standard papa johns, everything I have ordered is on par with other locations. My order is always correct and ready when I arrive. The brief interaction with the staff here has been pleasant.. Went to Icehouse for lunch with my beer-loving family when they were in town - Great choice.  I had the pulled-pork sloppy joe, which is basically just pulled pork that's been simmering in sauce, with a slice of cheese on top.  Good sauce, and nice bark on the pulled pork.  Family members ordered the blackened fish po boy and the buffalo chicken wrap.  The fish was cooked perfectly, and the buffalo chicken sandwich somehow stayed crispy for hours when I took home the leftovers.

As for the beer, it's a great selection (mainly bottles, tap list was disappointingly small at 8 beers vs something like 200 bottles).  Despite the few draft beers, the bottle selection gives beer lovers a good opportunity to try tons of random beers, and still never make it through the list.. I don't eat Filipino food often, but this place was great. Very friendly and clean. Prices were good and mostly importantly, the food was yummy. Will be coming back.. We were really looking for an izakaya other than Ichiza but couldn't find one (it turns out we were looking for Yonaka but didn't know it), so decided to go to Hiromaru, which we had passed by many times and wanted to try.  I loved the interior - simple modern setting that was bright but easy on the eyes - which was divided into 3 sections.  When you walk in there is a bar-type area with tables in front.  There is a framed division to the large room on the left, and then a room with large sliding doors that provide privacy for large parties.  The Japanese server ladies were very pleasant and attentive, and that continued for the rest of the meal.  Very nice experience.

We order 2 ramens.  Shiroi Tonkatsu is a salt broth-based soup, and Kuroi Tonkatsu is a garlic and seafood salt broth.  That's according to the menu, but honestly we didn't know what to expect.  We also ordered a gyoza which was just okay.  The two ramens, however, were probably the best Japanese ramens I've had in the U.S.  The usual ramens have a soup taste that's fairly indistinct.  It's one of those where you like it, but you don't really know why.  But the two bowls here, had very distinctive  taste that was highly satisfying.  Shiroi had a distinctive garlic taste, and Kuroi had a mix of garlic and a toasty sesame seed-like flavor.  Very different but both very good.  The soups were a bit greasy, but that did not detract from the taste.

Having recently been to a couple of places in L.A. that I thought were very good - Jinya and Men Oh - I wasn't expecting much but came away with a place that others will have to try to beat.  


Table-for-1 Factor:  I think with the sizable bar area and the fact it is ramen, the set up is all there for you to enjoy Hiromaru on your own.. After walking by this restaurant many times over the years, we stopped in for a late lunch. We opted for a booth to avoid the traffic flow outside the place and people fresh off their highs from the oxygen bar around the corner.

Food was excellent (we both had the carbonara), portions were generous, and service was amicable and sincere - from the host to the server to the multiple staff members that thanked us on our way out. Definitely an experience we'd repeat.. Ate here again last wkd.. service was good, but their chinois chicken salad has fallen off a bit.  Tuna was good.. I like to stop by here every so often just to see if there are any good deals to be had. Most of the items are used and were acquired from houses that were being refurbished by habitat for humanity. I do concede that just a few of the items seem to be priced a bit on the high side, but there are still plenty of great deals. If I'm doing a house project, I usually like to stop here to see if I can find any of the building supplies on my list and then I'll fill in the gaps at Home Depot. As far as I know, all of the proceeds go to Habitat so it's nice to get a bargain and be able help out others at the same time. I'll definitely keep stopping here because you never know when a hidden gem will be found! Also, I should add that this store has a much better inventory than the newer store on W Sahara. Given enough time though, I'm sure that store will come around but for now, this is the place to go!. I admit that I have visited A-Team Motorcycles as a tire-kicking tourist while in Vegas, not as a checkbook-ready consumer.  That said... I've stopped in here numerous times, under both the current name/owner and the previous, and always found the staff to be courteous, friendly, engaging, conversational.   I've been offered and taken impromptu "tours" of their shop to see various custom jobs in progress.   The staff doesn't mind if I want to throw a leg over the (stock) bikes on the showroom floor.  
 
I think I bought a t-shirt there, once.
 
What's that say?  That you've got a welcoming and inviting store environment, a dealership that will and has treated me like a human, not as a wa$te of their time.
 
And have I actually wasted their time?  Well if you the reader see this review and then go in there to buy an Indian from them (they have a great selection on hand btw), then maybe it's just good business sense that they're practicing, to treat everyone this way.   Lots of cycle dealers nationwide (Honda and Harley I'm talking to you, not all but certainly MANY) would do well to take this lesson.. This is nice hookah lounge, not too big, but the ambiance was good. 
I have been to several however, this was the first time for my friend. I was pondering which flavor to get, as I like to sometimes try something new. Blueberry was recommended, I liked it. She only took three pulls total, but liked it also.
Apparently there is no additional charge for extra charcoals; the host was attentive to when they need to be replaced.. What an amazing place to eat!!!!!  Great prices and great food!!!  Staff is very friendly!!!  Best hummas and pita chips ever!!!!  I've tired other similar Greek places, but this is by far the best.  

The rice is my favorite!!!!  

Highly recommended!!!!

Opa!!!!. This review is for Mary at advanced aesthetics med spa. I am a physician and let me first state that I can't stress how important it is to find someone who is technically skilled particularly when you are having a syringe/product injected into your face. This is not like getting a haircut and the consequences of choosing a bad provider can not just be cosmetic in nature but also medical as well. I have had Botox and fillers on and off for about 15 years or so and have probably seen about 50 or 60 providers. I have on many occasions in the past, had very poor aesthetic results primarily because the person using the syringe did not know where to place the filler, placed too much filler, did not lay it down properly and aesthetically the results were simply not pleasing. It's a very thin line between going overboard or not and it's critical to find someone that has both medical technical skills as well as an artistic eye. I have found in the 15 years that I have done this that that combination is very difficult indeed to find. I have seen many providers with M.D. after their names, but have not necessarily achieved good results, because my presumption was as an M.D. they must be better than the nurse. But in fact the MD is spending 99.9% of his time performing breast augmentation's and other plastic surgical procedures so it isn't necessarily the case that he/she is going to be an expert with the syringe. Medically speaking I found this out the hard way as well, as I had a provider at a med spa in Los Angeles place the filler incorrectly and caused me to get some permanent scarring. A small scar in the face but nonetheless very traumatic for about two years. That's why it's so important to find someone who knows what they're doing. Before Mary I was getting my fillers and Botox from a very prominent Beverly Hills dermatologist. She was excellent but the cost of the syringe was close to $800. Realizing the difficulty in finding that combination of artistic integrity as well as medical acumen, I was happy to pay it because at least I knew I was in good hands. When moving to Las Vegas for the first year or two here I drove back and forth to Beverly Hills because I did not want to switch off to another provider for the reasons stated above. Someone in the medical community here told me about Mary and I decided to take a chance and it turned out to be a great decision. Mary has that unique combination of both medical training, clinical skills, and an excellent artistic eye. She has seen thousands of patients over many years, and experience and training is important obviously. She is also able, I have found to understand exactly what it is that I'm trying to explain to her regarding what I want done. Meaning to say that she sees what I see. In other words she gets it. Well over 95% of all other doctors/nurses that I have seen don't. Not only does Mary know where to put the filler but most importantly she knows where NOT to put it. As an added bonus the pricing is the lowest I have ever seen. I'm paying about half of what I was paying. That's the strange thing about it. It's the best cosmetic work I've ever had done for the least amount of money, which seems strange but it's true. From my perspective as a physician and patient I would highly recommend coming to see Mary if you're thinking about having filler/Botox. You'll be a good hands.. This place is by far, one of the BEST places I have EVER eaten. Their Lengua, Carne, & Birria are AMAZING!!! Everything here is homemade and truly incredible.. With two kids under the age of 4 the only time I get to work out is at lunch or mid afternoon if I'm home. This is the home gym. 

First, I love it. The equipment is newer, well maintained, the staff is friendly and helpful when needed. The lap pool is nice and also maintained. The biggest things I do is: run, spin, swim & lift. There are always plenty of machines to go around, and there are never too many out of order at any given time. I love the separate locker rooms for the pool. The dryers do the job on the trunks, but aren't always working. The locker rooms are well kept and clean. 

My only complaint, there is a group of teenagers that show up after school lets out that workout there. I don't much care about that so much as I do that when they are there they are loud...sometimes disruptive, and when I want a machine and see these guys taking their time, yelling at friends and not working out that hard, it can be frustrating if not annoying. I try to go when they aren't there, but since I go for my lunch hour at work, sometimes I can't avoid it and have to go later. 

Other than that, it's a fine place to workout and I look forward to doing so for a long time.. Food was great. We ate family style and had 7-8 different dishes. My favorite was the watermelon salad. Place is small but service was great.  Sangria was excellent too. Best meal I had in Vegas!. Casual atmosphere, awesome food and very affordable. Highly recommended! Top it all off with the deep fried PB&J dessert ;-). As far as casinos and hotels go. The Wynn properties are as good as it gets. Everything about this place is 5 stars. The restaurants, the rooms, EVERYTHING. Is it expensive? Yes, but in Vegas you get what you pay for. 

We arrived and were lucky enough to not have to wait in line to check in. We had a private check in then went up to our room. No detail was overlooked in the rooms. The bed was plush and comfortable. The floor to ceiling windows gave us a beautiful view of the strip. 

I love this hotel. If you have the opportunity to stay here, do so you won't regret it. 

The staff is awesome and always willing to help you with whatever you need. Take advantage of the concierge as well, it saved us time standing in line for tickets to shows.

We enjoyed man of the restaurants that are in the Wynn and Encore. We will be back for sure, we'll try getting a room in the Encore next time.. Great spot for a casual dinner or drinks. Good atmosphere. Good menu. Good prices. Menu is a bit small but you sacrifice quantity for great quality. The gnocchi is delicious. And any of the pasta dishes are fantastic. Definitely a new neighborhood favorite spot for date nights.. Been back a couple times since last review.  Margaritas were perfect both times.  Watermelon margaritas are unstoppable!  Chile relleno was a little bland and soupy, but the rest of the menu was terrific as usual.. Aweome, ow simple is that. I have come to rely on The Grapevine for any of the events we hold at Infinite Wellness Ciropractic of Fort Mill SC. Dave and the team are always prepared for all of our event needs. Thanks for everything you guys do.... The Grapevine location has great atmosphere, selection and staff..... We ordered our pizzas to go yet we did wait in the bad area for a bit having a beer. Although we weren't there long I noticed it has a great neighborhood vibe to it. I like how the bar area is somewhat separate from the main dining area yet you're not completely cut off from the tvs in the bar. 

Service was quick and friendly and the staff was all decked out in Christmas wear. 

The pizza was great, especially if your a thin crust fan. The XL doesn't mess around size wise!

Can't wait to come back to stay longer!. Been going here for over 20 years.  Sushi is world class.  Not a glam sushi bar with ok overpriced sushi.  Saki bombers $6.00, was $5 20 years ago.  They don't raise their prices very often.  Lunches are a great deal too.  Teppan tables are fun for special occasions.  Great old school sushi bar!!!. Really good Mediterranean food.  Nice outdoor seating area in a nice shopping center.  Love it!. Food was awesome.  Had some local beer for me to try out. Food came out quickly and reasonably priced.. Great burgers at a decent price.  Service was friendly and prompt and the atmosphere is awesome.  This is my new favorite local burger joint.. I like that the machines are not overpriced and that you get a lot of play for some quarters. Blinking lights, the sound of flippers knocking around some pinballs, this place is great fun if you're looking for a solid dose of arcade nostalgia. I enjoy finding all the pinball machines I used to play growing up and giving them a spin for old times sake.. Just finished up a workout and was super hungry and craving pizza for some reason. I don't know any pizza places in the area (just moved here from out of state), so I jumped on yelp and found the highest rated pizza joint in my area. Luckily Natali's is only a mile from my apartment. 

So I drove over and was a bit skeptical at first. It was in the right corner of the shopping plaza and at the front it said "Pizzeria" I wasn't sure if I was at the right place but decided to walk in and check it out. I walked in and saw the menu said Natali's so I knew we were in business. The shop is divided into two sections one for ordering/drink station and the other half is the dining area. I ended up ordering the Natali's special which had peperoni, sausage, bacon, green onions, mushrooms, red onion, and olives. 

This is why I gave my 5 star rating:

Food: 
Was up there with some of the best pizza I've eaten. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful, the consistency of the cheese was perfect and not overdone like some places and the tomato sauce was also on point. But I think the best part of the pizza was the crust and dough. The bottom of the pizza had the perfect texture in my opinion, it was the right combination of crunch with out being hard. The dough was fluffy and had good flavor, didn't taste like pre-made dough that was frozen. 

Service: I came in about an hour before closing and I could clearly see the owners were tired. I forgot to mention the shop is owned by a couple, the wife takes the orders and handles the register, and the husband makes the pizzas I think. Both were very friendly despite from what I could tell had been a long day for them. Friendly attitude and answered my questions about the different sizes of pizza, certain toppings, and suggestions. I was eating alone so I asked what size they suggested, and went with the small for $15 dollars. I ended up only eating half so I took the other half home. Great deal if you think about, two good meals for $15. Pizza only took about 10 minutes to come out which was not a long wait at all and well worth it.

Ambiance: 
Nothing fancy, but I like the decor. As you walk in you see to the left a Pittsburgh Steelers collection on the wall with a tv showing the NFL network. I liked it since I'm a football fan. The dining area is nice, a bit small but has a cozy home feeling to it. Clean and nice decor, no complaints. I sat there eating pizza and watching football, not a bad combo.

Overall I really liked the food and people that work here. They're a couple who opened this shop 2 years ago and are willing to have a conversation with you which is nice, I'm rooting for them. Highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the mood for really good pizza at a great price. Don't hesitate by the outside of the shop, just walk right through the door and get yourself some damn good pizza.. This, by far, is THE best burger in town!  Add some of their onion strings and you have a winner!  My favorite is the BBQ Jack burger and I always add bacon.  The place is all covered outdoor seating right across from the Wynn and at the end of the mall on the strip.

Tip: park on the back side of the mall by Trump Towers and take a nice stroll through the mall to get there - it's fun!

Whenever you're walking the strip and need a boost, give it a shot!. This place is totally amazing. They figured out how to make enchiladas not only fun and cool...but absolutely delicious. The meat selection is awesome...and the tortillas are incredible. Highly recommend. You will be back.. Top quality sushi restaurant!  It was easy to slip in for an early dinner on Friday evening, we were seated quickly at the sushi bar.  Excellent service from everyone and delicious food.  I will certainly be going back, often!. By far the best Gyro place in town. Great customer service, and most of all, the food is amazing. Their tztaki sauce is unbeatable, and I would definitely recommend the Chicken Pita for anyone who goes. Easy 5/5, recommended to all family and friends.. Great gym. Great kids club if you have little ones of all sizes. Awesome spin classes, especially Thursday early and Sunday hour long class. Highly recommend the village even if you do not play tennis.. Stopped in here for lunch on a Tuesday; the place was packed.... On a Tuesday!!! I'd have to agree with everyone else on here. The service is quick and friendly, the atmosphere is cozy, the egg rolls are the best around and the Tomato Chile Chicken that I got was yummy (although I wouldn't quite characterize it as "spicy" like the menu implied). 

With my total bill coming to $8.50 plus tip, I'd put the Chinatown Inn in the "great value" column.. chicken was deliciously greasy!! yummy!!! lol i could only eat it once a year. the are probably the most original place to eat home-style fried chicken. it's just sooooo gooooood!! 

the service was friendly and i would it if they delivered to AZ or build one out here.. I drove 20 minutes to check out this place and it was well worth it!  It was truly refreshing to see something different from your run-of-the-mill coffee shops.  Looking at this place from the outside, dare I say that this place used to be one of those large chain coffee shops?  Dun dun dun...

Anyway, once I walked in, I realized that this place isn't a chain.  The decor is chic which non-corporatey furniture and looks very homey.  Service is excellent and I was asked if I've ever been there before.  They were patient with me while I perused their menu of non-corporatey drinks.  

I ordered the Almond Roca Mocha latte, iced (since it was 100 degrees outside).  It truly hit the spot - woke me up (but not like "jolt") and it also hit the sweet craving I was looking for. 

If sweet isn't your thing or if you're looking for super strong coffee, then I'm sure they make something for you to.  Oh and they have a drive thru if you're in a rush.. I am crazy about Costa Vida! The food is spectacular, the atmosphere is inviting and the location is wonderful. 

The Sweet Pork is a must try if you haven't. I can't get enough of the tomatillo ranch and the chips and queso are ridiculously good. I could see it being a really great place for a student to call ahead and get their food on the way to class. It's nice to have a really fresh Mexican restaurant with a lot of flavor finally in my neighborhood. 

My experience has been that the staff and management are very accommodating if I bring something to their attention.. Ordered the White Macadamia.  Cass and Angelique turning heads and giving outstanding service.  Awesome place!!. Wonderful awesome atmosphere hip place excellent food great prices$$. Best spot in town for late night 2 on weekdays 3 in weekend. When I want fast delicious food I make togo orders. Cant beat the portion size and the prices.. My heat was out. Dave arrived promptly at 7pm. He checked out my units in the attic and found the problem to be my thermostat. In and out in 20 min. No extra charge for night and weekends or distance. Did not try to sell me extras I didn't need. I WILL NOT call anyone else for service. Legacy only from now on. Give them a try. You will not regret it.. Great place to visit if u are in PIT. Lots of character, friendly staff and no nonsense good food.. My wife and I were visiting friends.  (Yes I just got married), and my stomach was growling something awful. So we all decided to hit this place up for our first visit dinner. What a pleasant surprise it was when we walked in. The reclaimed wood was a nice accent along with the brick walls and the lights remade from old fans. Real comfy inside.
Lets get to the food shall we. We all shared a plate full of nachos which were presented on a rectangular cookie sheet. We basically devoured them in plain sight of everyone, and wasn't ashamed of it either. For our entrees I chose the beet salad and my wife got the Brussels sprouts salad. I know, I know, who orders salad at a barbecue place? Sorry, but someone has to eat a little healthy now and then. My salad was good but a little small. It could have been bigger but the dressing was nice and the veggies were fresh. The Brussels sprouts salad was a nightmare. We were shocked they were raw. You have to cook them first so you don't break your teeth on them. I had a few bites as well as my wife and tossed the rest. They really should put them in the oven or fry them up first. Won't be getting that again. All n all a nice experience for our first time. I'm not going to let the Brussels salad damper the night. Will try  again on a cheat night and splurge on something juicy.  Later. great GREAT experience. Troy in sales was very knowledgeable & helpful. Every employee there( sales, parts, service, management & service tech) was concerned that my experience was great. A real pleasure to do business there. Very affordable place to eat.  What seems to bring people here is the daily lunch specials at 5.95 and you do get a decent portion for that price along with a small complimentary bowl of egg drop soup.  Service not the best but you really can't beat the price here at all.. Great prices, great selection and a dream for pre-teen girls.  New store in excellent condition with superior staff.. Awesome as usual.  (Went with the full rack of original style ribs, add fried shrimp tossed in the thai phoon sauce, and broccoli and mashed potatos). I was gonna go 3 stars on this, but they've got some good eats in here, so let's call it 3.5, OK?

Self-parking for check-in is a breeze. Stop trying to find a space on level 1 and go up a few so that you can park right next to an elevator. 

Check-in was slow and laborious. I can't believe in 2013 people still have to clack a thousand and one keys to confirm the reservation I already paid 50% of online. There should be a service where you can book a specific room online, show up with your credit card, slide it in the lock and BOOM you're in. Who wants to deal with some chipper chick doing her worst to get you checked in fast after a 5 hour drive to Vegas? 

The rooms are decent. At least, ours was. I'm sure they get better. We had a pretty good view of some mountains. It's not like you're getting a strip view anywhere here, so might as well just get whatever is available for the right price. The mini bar and counter bar are scary because if you even knock something out of it by accident you're charged automatically. And, yes, the prices are grossly inflated. 

The bathrooms blow. Our sink, which I thought was cool because it had a super deep basin, was not cool because that super deep basin filled up every time we used it. Ditto on the shower, which at one point filled so much I might as well have taken a bath. Plus, how the hell am I supposed to wash myself AND pee in the shower when it's up to my calves? Seriously, guys. 

I liked their sexually suggestive door hangers - turn it to "Tied Up" if you don't want the maid. Which we did, often. But she still came anyway. I assume they just ignore them. 

As I said, between Pink Taco, Mr. Lucky's 24/7, Culinary Dropout and whatever else you come across this hotel has some good foodstuffs. And clearly at least one of them is open 24 hours. 

The fitness center was closed for AVN Awards (No, I did not go because I arrived the day after it occurred. Yes, that did upset me.), so I got directed up to the cardio room. Which is exactly that - a room full of cardio eq. Of course, since the gym was temporarily closed I was welcome to use the spa's gym facility... for a reduced-from-$25-a-day, $10/day fee. So, had their own gym been open it's free, but since it isn't I get to pay a reduced fee of $10? Well, fuck me, isn't that a deal?

Check out didn't work on my TV for whatever reason. Luckily, doing it down at the lobby is a breeze. No hassle or waiting or whatever. Why can't they make it this easy to get into the place?. I don't know how anyone could give this place a bad review... Just Cause your life sucks doesn't mean you need to try and deface a wonderful business!

I had called Kevin the GM and told him I needed to throw a party for my customers and co-workers, and boy I was impressed.
Food epic, staff epic, event epic..
People are still talking about the friendliness of the staff and the intimacy if the event.
I would recommend Midtown to all Vegas locals and travelers alike.
Thank you midtown ...
Kevin and Lindsay are the bomb!!. Great happy hour spot. 1/2 price drinks and appetizers. 
Friendly staff nice decor. Small enough to talk and enjoy. 
Highly recommend.. I experienced my first poutine at this place. Nice quaint little place, but the food is amazing! I'm glad I got to experience my poutine here. Actually went to this place twice in one day. One for lunch and one for after late night drinking.. Convenient location right next to the 24 Hour gym and Zipps sports grill. Typical, consistent service. They hold my money so that's good.. ED staff is great here!. I no longer bother writing reviews of restaurants with mediocre food.  I only bother if it's really good, or really bad.  And Sushi Station, a "conveyer belt" sushi place is... OUTSTANDING!  In Japan carousel sushi is typically the cheapest, and lowest quality.  Ditto for the revolving sushi places I've been in America, like the one out on Bell road.  But not Sushi Station.  Their fish is incredibly fresh.  Their rolls are unique, like the Tempura California roll.  Or the Crab stuffed Jalapeno popper.  Seaweed salad is good.  A lot of Unagi (eel) rolls that rock. Their faux crab stuffing is definitely superior to others, perhaps they mix in some real crab.  It's not goopy, loaded with mayo like most, even upscale sushi houses.  Get there before five and you can have a fantastic AND highly affordable meal.  You pay per plate at a rotisserie Sushi place, certain color plates are certain prices.  But hey, it's ALL affordable here, esp at happy hour.  My buddy, a professional chef AND sushi gourman like myself, we couldn't wait to go back after a single visit.  For the two of us, plus 3-4 items "to-go" for his sick GF, we spent $40, not including any alcohol, not happy hour either.   Very reasonable, IMHO, for first rate sushi.  Like Schwarzenegger sez, "I WILL BE BACK!". Great find in the Arrowhead area!  Prices are very affordable and fresh sushi is always around you. First time at a revolving sushi bar and it was a fun experience. Didn't have to wait for food, just picked it right off of the conveyer belt. Staff was extremely courteous.  Will definitely be back :). I've been working some straight to the point reviews lately so I'm going to keep up with my current trend. Heres the 1,2,3.

The beer is on point! The Imperial IPA was the super star tonight. Just an amazing beer. All of the beer offerings were well made. Good stuff all the way around.

The pizza is MONEY!!! Wood fired, thin crust, fresh ingredients. This is what all other pizza wants to grow up to be! Possibly....the best pizza in Phoenix.Yeah, I effin said it! Loved it. We had a salad too. Great but completely overshadowed by the pizza.

Nice build out, comfortable atmosphere and friendly service. This is a great place. Check it out!. I've gone a few times now so it's become my Sushi restaurant of choice when I'm craving. Food is really good and the happy hour menu has enough items that you wont really miss the regularly priced stuff. The servers I've had have all been friendly and took care of anything I needed. Delicious!. Great place and was much needed! The atmosphere is family friendly and there is so much to do after the move!. I travel from North Phoenix to take all my cars to Los Olivos. I consistantly receive quality and expert service.  Granted, you're not going to get "in and out" very quickly (which can be annoying at times) but my car is always cleaned to my satisfaction.  Although everyone there, from the cashiers to the car washing staff, is friendly and professional, I need to make a shoutout to Jovel.  She is the first person you usually see when you drop your car off (very smart move).  She is such a joy and really makes you feel welcomed and like you're a valued customer.  I don't usually gush this much on my Yelp reviews but Los Olivos is a very special place.  Keep up the good work!. This is a must stop for me and my wife. We don't even have to look at the menu dozen oysters and two fish tacos excellent. Sometimes they do have small oysters but we said something to them and they threw in a couple more. Go to the bar next door and pick up a couple bud light red beers in a 24 oz can prior to going. 
Nor Cal 209. Took my 2016 Corvette Stingray here for window tinting.   To say I was apprehensive would be a major understatement.   At that time I only had the car for 2 weeks and I was quite nervous about handing it over to anyone.  I chose this shop based on the universally outstanding reviews.  I was not disappointed.   

The tint is the most precise job I've ever seen!  I've had tint jobs before where you can see easily where the tint ends at the top of the window.  Not so for this one, the tint goes virtually to the edge of the glass and looks absolutely perfect.  

They took the time to make sure I felt comfortable every step of the way, that was greatly appreciated.  While I waited they had a waiting room with television and complementary water, also appreciated.

About two weeks after having the tint job done, I noticed a blemish on the driver's side window.  I called the shop and they told me to bring it in, same day! When I got there they took a look at it and immediately decided to replace the flawed piece of film.  The new piece looked every bit as good as the one that was replaced, it was installed perfectly again.

I selected Llumar ceramic film and it is doing an incredible job of keeping heat out of the cockpit.  I haven't been using a front sun shade and it's not excessively hot in the car after sitting outside all day.  That really impressed me.

There's a reason why this shop has so many amazing reviews, they do beautiful work and provide excellent customer service after the sale.. Absolutely delicious ramen. The hakata and the chashu are my favorites. It can get busy but don't let a wait discourage you. Completely worth it.. I am new to Yelp - even though I haven't been to Soba in awhile it is my absolute favorite place to go for a nicer meal in Pittsburgh.  If I ever have the choice - the Seared Ahi Tuna with BBQ would be my last meal on earth.  The atmosphere, the service, the food, the drinks (Pickle Martini!), everything is always on point.  I highly recommend Soba!. Always been fan of Jjanga since visited the original location on Decatur. I feel like the quality of the fish is top notch with other top AYCE sushi spots! Unlike the original at this location they also offer Teppanyaki Hibachi style. Not really fan of the whole Hibachi show but while sitting with friends for AYCE. We were able to watch some of the show and seems like the customers at the tables were having good time. Maybe next time have the urge might check other half of the restaurant. One side have the Hibachi and the other side have traditional restaurant style for AYCE or a la carte style sushi. One of the other differences is this place is lot bigger and lot more modern. The sushi bar is decent size and if ever want get Jjanga on solo more then enough room plus have nice wide screen televisions above. The service was awesome! They were on top of all of our orders every round and never empty glass in front of us. 

Something I enjoy looking at the menu. Just the creative names they have for some of there sushi rolls. Not that the rolls itself is totally different then other rolls find at other sushi spots. I like the fact they have fun with different names and thinking outside the box. I enjoy the spicy roll section there really not bad one to choose from. Best part about have another Jjanga is never have enough of good thing in life. Quality sushi seems like lost art in Vegas with the abundance of AYCE sushi. Jjanga is one that deserve five star and would put it right up there with any other five star sushi spot in Vegas.

Jjanga by far coolest sushi chef and owner. The guy truly cares about each customer having great experience and just good guy.. Coyote was our waiter excellent service and good sense of humor. I have never had bad service at this Palm location. Shrimp cocktail great (4) huge prawns and mild and bold cocktail sauce. Lobster bisque better than I remember. Small wedge salad is huge and excellent. Filet Oscar special with a generous portion of crab was prepared perfectly, the filet passed the cut it with a fork test.. This place has a great menu. Very eclectic. The food was excellent. We ate her twice while we were in town.. RR is consistently a great place to visit.  It is clean and has really great food.  They don't even blink an eye when asked to customize a meal, no matter how odd.  This place is good for families, as well as elderly.  Alison is always a fantastic server; a ray of sunshine.. I forget what kind of butter they gave us for the bread, but I think it had the words honey, truffle, and butter folded in there somewhere. Needless to say, if their free items were that good, I couldn't wait to try the main course. Lobster gnocchi was my choice, and at $31, it was a tough one indeed. The portions weren't that big (not what I'm used to anyway with all the other restaurants we've eaten at). Once the plate arrived, I asked myself if this is how true Italians eat--without stuffing their faces and eating themselves into comas like we Americans do. But then I asked myself why they were still so fat, so I concluded that it must be the butter. Either way, my friend got more lobster than I did, but it was still delicious. The gnocchi melts in your mouth like it should, so that was a plus.

For dessert, we had three flavors of sorbet, the doughnuts, and the tiramisu. Sorbets were a bit icy, but the doughnuts were great deep fried balls of delicious, especially when dipped in the caramel or hazelnut sauce provided. Tiramisu was smooth, but not that high in my book.. Food was great. They've got a great menu to choose from....Also the service was excellent. I've been here many times and it's consistently been a great place to dine.. I was going to order the phozilla challenge, but I was talked out if it by the owner which was good honest advice.  After a long night of club crawl, the pho would treat any ailment like....let's say hangover.

I got the large bowl of pho for $17 enough to feed two, but I was able to finish it.  The broth was good and had good taste.  I especially like the owner stopping be each table to greet us.  A++ for hospitality and food.  We paid out bill and left to our car, realizing that we locked our keys and had to return to the restaurant to cool off from Vegas weather.  She welcomed us back with water, free dessert, free fruits to taste.  I recommend this place.  Pho87 scheduled to open in Paris casino next year.. Thinking cold toppings is going to tast great sounds odd....... But, this is great pizza. 
When you commit to doing something as odd as cold toppings you are going to strike out or hit a homer. Betos hit a Grandslam. 
Please stop in. It's a dive but it's outrageously good!!!. I Love The Rock! It is a Friendly Neighborhood Bar that has made some amazing changes in the last year! The drinks are reasonably priced, the staff is friendly, the owners do ALOT for their community and are very focused on Giving Back to the community that Supports Them! You can experience a wide array of entertainment here...Drag, Comedy, Live Music, Dance Parties, Pagaents, Karaoke, Poker and Darts. Greeted on our way in and as we left. Workers approaced us to tell us of the current discount and if we needed help. I didnt feel pressured, i was comfortable enough to joke around with them. Lots of interesting crafts and a variety of household items and food. Some food items were new and unusual in a good way. Wife found some Vegemite which she claims is the best thing in the world. Store was clean. Food Items were pricy but can't  complain because they were items you don't find in a regular grocery store. If you grew up outside of the continental US they may have a snack, food item, or drink you grew up with.. Amazing place for lunch.

The salads are delicious and the portion sizing is huge! Good thing it's a salad so there is no harm in actually finishing what you get! I've had the Tokyo and the Mexican - both were really incredible. 

They have a  really great selection of drinks - my recommendation would be Fentiman's Rose Lemonade. 

If you're feeling sinful end the meal with their scrumptious chocolate chip cookies. You deserve a cookie after the healthy salad you just ate. 

Warning: it was pretty crowded during lunch time so I would budget your time accordingly! Maybe go a little earlier or later so you can nab a good spot on their terrace!. Best Pizza In Charlotte, Brooklyn South is a close second.  I do wish they had real buffalo wings but I have never had a bad experience.. Let's just start out by saying Alex and his crew saved me over $3,000 in repairs when taking my truck in. 
     I found Air Park Auto Clinic about a year ago and have used them and referred them to many of my friends and family, and all have been extremely happy wi the service. About 8 months ago I bought my first new vehicle in about 10 years from a dealership and bought the extended warranty. About 6 months later I noticed that my transmission was slipping and not knowing any better i took it in to the Certified dealership that I bought it from thinking that I had to have them do the the repairs since that's where I bought the warranty. They had my truck for over a week and told me that it was a bushing that was causing my RPMs to go up and that it's not covered by the warranty and were gonna charge me over $1,200 to fix the problem. This is when I realized that I could take my truck anywhere that I wanted which Air Park Auto Clinic would've been my first choice from the get go. Anyhow, I then Called Air Park Auto clinic and spoke with Alex while I was at the dealership and told him the problem and what my truck was doing. With out hesitation he told me in all of about 30 seconds that there's no way a bushing is causing the problem and to bring it down to him. I did just that and after the dealership had my truck for over a week and were gonna charge me over $1,200 to fix something that wasn't the problem, Alex and his crew called me back with in acpl hrs and informed me that it was in fact the transmission and insured me that they were confident that the warranty would cover it wi out a doubt. I was obviously very relieved to hear the great news and about a week later I got my truck back wi no out of pocket coat and a brand new transmission that runs better than the original. This is the BEST shop in town and will continue to refer anyone that I know to them for the simple fact that they do great work and more importantly they are as honest as they come which is hard to find with any business these days especially mechanics. Thanks Air Park Auto Clinic you guys are the BEST!. My partner and I have walked past this restaurant many times along with myriad Christmas shoppers in Market Square. It's the sister restaurant to a Mount Lebanon location and we thought it would make a cozy New Year's Eve destination.

Il Pizzaiolo offers five different house-made pastas and the other pasta dishes they offer are from Pasta Faella, which the house claims as the best pasta in the world. Well, I don't know about all that but our pasta dishes were damn delicious. 

For starters, we ordered arancini, which are ping pong ball-sized fried balls of rice, coated in breadcrumbs and lightly fried. Two were filled with creamy cheese and two were filled with salty pancetta. We've eaten arancini in Milan and these rivaled the originals, although they appeared a bit more carefully prepared here.The meal opened with a sliced round of warm, fragrant bread that had been baked in their 1000º brick oven just moments before. Just that is worth the price of admission.

My partner enjoyed Cavatelli con Rapini and I ordered Sedani alla Norma. The pasta was perfectly al dente (to be honest, mine was a smidge too al dente, but that was to my preference anyway--perhaps they have psychic chefs?). The house wine was a Nero d'Avola that was a nice compliment to the pastas although not earthshaking. The pasta dishes were expertly seasoned and generous in portion...neither of us could finish so we got to enjoy more for lunch the next day.

Our waitress, Sara was a wonderful part of our meal. She was pleasant and knowledgeable and checked on us just enough times. We sat on the first floor and were pleasantly surprised that (although it was New Years Eve) we had a table suitable for four all to ourselves. After an appetizer, soup, salad, two entrées, bread and a mezzolitro of house red, our bill (including tip) came to about $118. Every swallow was worth every dollar. We thank her and Il Pizzaiolo for a delicious welcome to 2014.

There is no doubt...we will be back. Perhaps next time to try one of those wonderful-smelling pizzas that our fellow diners couldn't stop shoveling in.. Our dog loves going here,  the owner Jin is great with her and the staff is always good.  I definitely recommend Pooches and Pals to anyone looking for a good place.. I have had my hair done at many of the very prestigious salons and barber shops in the Las Vegas area and I must tell you that LONDON KEIL is the absolute best barber in Las Vegas and quite possibly the best barber in the United States. He is consistent and his precision is flawless. I have sent numerous friends to him and he has made all of them look slick, fresh, and dapper. London is a master of his craft. Request LONDON KEIL. He will make you look the best you have ever looked in your life.. Tried Pita Jungle for the 1st time today. Food was excellent, had the gyro and it was great. Server was friendly and was very attentive.. Didn't think I could find craft beer in AZ but lo and behold I found this place on yelp nearby and it is awesome with an excellent selection on tap. Place looks hard to find upon arrival but once in it is bustling with folks of all ages. Food is also awesome! Highly recommended for the eloquent drinker in town looking for craft beer.. Awesome new spot on the northside in Deuschetown. In the space formerly known as Serendipity a block off east ohio street.

The Pierogies were amazing. Definately will be going back.. Great place for a tasty lunch.  Since they make everything to order, I often order the mixed vegetables and have them spice it up.  My favorite is the House Special Chicken.  Plenty of food for the price.  A good selection of dishes.  What's not to like?. yo, I's serious.   Dis is me Good Luck club or something, cause when as soon as I walk in, I's got all these hoey looking girls all up on me.   I figure they like my bling, thats why.   or maybe because I's handsome.

I gots me dog bone growing like mad inches up in this club.
    i just wave me hand and be like,  "Yo, you want some of this big dong or what?"     and the girls just come on over.    

I just have good luck in this club.. Good atmosphere but a bit loud. Excellent service that makes the price you pay worth it.. Items Selected:

A longtime fan of Michael Mina's restaurants, but gunshy of a Chef often seen as an absentee landlord after a subpar meal at Pub1842 and the embarrassment that is StripSteak it was with mixed emotions that four friends and I entered American Fish Re-Brand "Bardot Brasserie" but with an old friend setting up the reservation for us just two weeks after the restaurants opening I think it is safe to say that the team in place at Bardot is every bit on par with the experiences of old while the cuisine represents a textbook rendering of plates coming out of the kitchens in France.

Truly a stunning room, the $5.7 million investment obvious from the slick looking bar up front and highly polished tile alongside dark woods throughout, it was at a makeshift banquet near the front of the dining area that we were sat clearly doing their homework on everything from the branding font on plates to the styles of glassware for each drink it was by both the General Manager and his Assistant that questions were answered, the captain then taking over with great suggestions and perfect pacing offered by both he and the restaurant's back-server staff.

Comped free-flowing Rose as well as an iced bowl of crisp crudite to begin the meal, but paying $55/pp for the other sixteen plates served over the next three hours, it was with warm baguette paired to salted butter that the meal began and at the bargain basement price of just $6 each two baskets of bread were selected - the Kouign Amann and Croissant a touch flaccid despite good flavors while the raisin snail and canele were both excellent, the later a large scale rendition with crisp shell and custard center that I'd suggest is the best in the city and something I'd love to taste warm and just set.

Presented next with two styles of pate, the first a rough cut pork composition rich with funk and nuts while the foie was pure velvet beneath a port gelee glaze, it was with extra crunchy bread that each bite was enjoyed, and following up with a crispy crust topped in pork and onions with a smoky top note the first true 'showstopper' of the morning arrived in the form of a crab-topped crepe - the hearty buckwheat base, tender mushrooms, and copious serving of sweet crab all noteworthy but the tableside addition of beurre blanc melding it all together and putting it over the top.

Pleasantly surprised by the beefy sapor and balanced sweetness of the onion soup, a 'must order' item for one of my friends, and more than a little impressed by snails served out of their shell in the form of garlicky 'popcorn escargot' beneath light breading entirely devoid of grease it was onward to more brunchy items that the meal progressed and with the soft malted sourdough waffle proving a stunning foil to the crispy confit duck while the Croque was nothing short of the high standard set at Bouchon it was the thick-cut French Toast that undoubtedly stole the show - a custard soaked masterpiece with golden edges reminding me of the landmark version served at LeMeac in Montreal.

Admittedly a bit lacking in pastas as the meal moved into entrees and sides, the cleverly presented macaroni unfortunately a bit too salty while tender gnocchi and mushrooms were a bit muddled beneath a touch too much garlic, one should pay close attention to the chicken at Bardot just as they should at any of Michael Mina's restaurants, and with comments speaking of Peking Duck as relates to crackling skin the flesh of the brined bird was equally impressive, each herbaceous bite tender and juicy with snappy beans and rich mushroom pudding at its side.

Ending with dessert, three of the menus' six options selected to be shared, it comes as no surprise that a Mina restaurant finishes strong with sweets and although both the macaron and tarte tatin are excellent with a tableside finish it is the mille-feuille that steals the show, each flaky layer of pastry shattering to the fork as delicate pastry cream presents silky, sweet, and almost as light as air.

Already impressive at just a few weeks in, and executing French classics at a level as good or better than any similar Stateside restaurant, Bardot looks to raise the bar for mid-range French cuisine in Las Vegas - a tall order when up against names like Keller, Boulud, and Meyer, but one the Mina empire seems ready to take on with a great team in a dazzling space.. Shiloh Grill = Harris Grill. Same decor, same hipster wait staff, same menu. That being said, the food is just as good and I was happy with the service. I brought friends here so they could see the view from Mt. Washington, and they were very pleased with the food. I would think that the patio would be what would really sell this when it's not as cold out. Overall, this is where I would be going if I lived on the Mt.. So after my 1st review I was contacted by the owner of this fine establishment. He offer to remake my previous meal if I would come back in again. I more than gladly took them up on this offer. As the 1st time I visited Fuku was really good and the second time was just alright. 

This time I ordered the 1 and the 5. The burgers were both awesome. Love the pickled ginger on a burger and this time the number 5 had a little more heat to it. I still thing the special fries at this place are worth a pass in the long run. Just not enough fries for my taste. 

I did get a second to visit with the owner. He was a very nice guy who you can tell loves what he does. He is what more owners/managers should be like. Taking great pride in his product and making sure his customers are happy. He also explained how price is affected by were they are parked and how much a space rental might be. Makes more sense to me now. I will definitely be back the next time I am in Vegas. 

Note this is and upgraded review and the star rating reflects two 5 star experiences and a 3 star. If you want prob the best burger in Vegas then you will eat here.. These guys are by far the best management company I have ever had the pleasure of working with. They manage all of our MODE apartments and it works out very well. The state of a property usually comes down to the owners, not the management companies. Good owners = good properties, bad owners = bad properties.. Must hit the omelet station and the prime rib.  Always save room for dessert. One of my Favorite Thai restaurants.  I always get great food at this place and it's not just this location. I've eaten at the other 2 locations and the food is just as good.  I usually get the chilli mint noodles and yellow curry.  I have tried many other thing but stick with those as my favorite.. Good food decent price! But for some reason French fries isn't that good while the French onion soup is at room temperature and wasn't hot enough.

Go for the steak, it's very tender n juicy but the season isn't as impressive. For the price that you are expecting to pay, this supposedly is affordable French food!. Great smog check! Offered free bottled water and a great little sitting area. Only 5min smog but friendly and courteous.. Came with friends on St. Patrick's Day to enjoy some craft beers.  If you check in with Yelp you get a free Bud Light.  You can also get up to 2 free beers ($10 or less) if you are brave enough to chug them in under the time allowed by the bar top hourglass (7ish seconds).  Happy hour includes half priced pints which run around $5-$8.  You can also get $1 wings and deals on sliders/oysters.  Our female bartender was very friendly and made sure we were having a good time!. One word BOBBIE !!! It's the best sandwich ever created!

These guys and gals make the best sandwich on the planet. Every other sub shop just can't come close to the magical thanksgiving day celebration that takes place in your belly after consuming one of these masterpieces!. Ok, so here is the deal...this place is a hole in the wall, a dive, yeah it's not pretty.  BUT the Touchstone Rose is one of my favorite bars in Charlotte.  Why?  Here's why...they always have great drink specials, they have a huge patio with its own bar and flat screen tv's so you can smoke, the bar staff and waitresses are cute and good at their jobs, and to top it off the food is GREAT!  It's mostly a typical bar menu but they do it better than just about anyone in town.  A few things they do different though....they have a fried bologna sandwich that is topped with chili and and egg that rocks.  They are the only place in Charlotte (that I know of) that serves a Louisville Hot Brown sandwich.  If you've never had a hot brown...stop what you're doing now and go there!  They are nothing short of awesome.  Also, they offer to grill your hot wings.  Which I thought was a little strange because I'm picky when it comes to my wings.  But, it's really good!  The crowd is mixed but of Fridays and Saturdays it's pretty crowded after 11:00pm.  Overall....if you haven't been to the Touchstone Rose you should!. This place has excellent food, fantastic hummus, all in a great, casual grocery-adjacent atmosphere.  I recommend the tongue sandwich, so delicious and tender, but there's no bad item on the menu.  If you're looking for a place to eat, just stop reading reviews and go there now and get some delicious food. Seriously.. I eat at Tasty China at least twice a week. Really great quality chinese food that's flavorful and satisfying. One of the issues with most "american chinese" restaurants is great quality food with reasonable prices and this place has both.

They are always so nice and the service is always great. I would recommend Tasty China if you are looking for traditional "american chinese" comfort foods!. Huge place. We dined on the heated patio overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Dinner and a show.

Number 19 was our server. Evidently, the original location chooses not to advertise the server's names. She (Sharon) was quietly efficient without being too cool for the room. Amazing selection of French wines, escargot (piping hot and tasty), and oysters (super fresh with a watermelon finish).

The black cod was pure perfection, but they are best known for their filet mignon. Perfect medium rare, super buttery meat. The ribeye was 22 ounces of marbled salty bliss. Phenomenal. Terrific.. Strange location but one of the best bars inside 277. Ask for Ryan and relax. Order the hog wings, sample the amazing local beer options, and enjoy the sweater puppies and local blouse talent.. The Bellagio is one of the best hotels centered on the strip it's close to everything I would recommend staying at a less expensive hotel everything inside is a bit pricey but it is nice to splurge and have a getaway The room is excellent and have a king size bed and everything was well kept and maintained make sure you look for excellent price on The Internet and we came during March madness like every hotel it to got some age. Allgemein
Die Gockelburg in Maximiliansau (Pfalz), direkt bei Karlsruhe gelegen, einfach nur Baden verlassen, über die Rheinbrücke und schon ist man dort, ist ein Klassiker, der vielen Hähnchen-Fans in Karlsruhe und Umgebung bekannt ist. Entsprechend hoch ist die Frequentierung des Lokals. Es ist eng, im Sommer etwas freizügiger, da es einige Terrassenplätze gibt, es gibt nur große Tische, mit denen man teilweise mit Fremden sitzt, aber genau das macht den Charme des Lokals aus. Es gibt NUR Hähnchen und Brot. Keine Beilagen, kein Salat, Besteck nur auf Anfrage. Das Lokal ist mit unzähligen Hahnfiguren dekoriert. Die Einrichtung ist in die Tage gekommen, trotzdem MUSS man, gerade mit einer größeren Gruppe eine Reservierung vornehmen. Das Lokal ist nur abends und nur von Montag bis Freitag geöffnet. Die Reservierungstermine sind auch etwas anders gestaltet, wie in "normalen" Restaurants. Die Gäste werden in der Gockelburg in verschiedenen Zeitzonen abgewickelt, was bedeutet, dass man 3-4 mal das Lokal pro Abend füllt. Je später der Abend, umso leichter einen Tisch zu bekommen. An der Wand hängt ein Bild von Rudi Völler, der vor 3-4 Jahren mit einigen Funktionären des KSC dort zum Essen war, was die Bekanntheit des Lokals unterstreicht! :-)
Bedienung
Die Bedienungen sind immer die Gleichen. Es ist ein Familienbetrieb und es besteht keine (kaum) Fluktuation. Nett, familiär, schnell, freundlich. Diese Adjektive beschreiben bestens, was man dort erlebt. Man ist per "DU", man bekommt für die Pfalz üblich "Schoppen" (Wein oder Weinschorle in 0,5l Gläsern). Kein leichtes Leben für die Damen, da die Enge des Lokals das Bedienen natürlich nicht besonders einfach macht. Und trotzdem, die Damen sind immer "Herr" der Lage! :-)
Das Essen
Das Essen ist leicht erklärt. Es gibt Hähnchen mit Brot. Sonst nix! Das Hähnchen gibt es in verschiedenen Schärfegraden. Es fängt an mit Normal (auch ohne Pfeffer) für die Kinder. Weiter geht es über Mittel, dann Scharf, Extra-Scharf und Explosiv. Dazu bestellen kann man nur "Sauce", was keine Sauce ist, sonder nur vom Hähnchen geliefertes abgetropftes Fett. Da Fett die Schärfe im Mund bindet, brauchen dies viele, die sich eine Schärfegradstufe verkalkuliert haben! :-)
Damit wäre das komplette Essenangebot auch schon erklärt. Aber die Hähnchen sind lecker. Sehr lecker sogar. Ich weiß nicht genau, was das Geheimnis der Hähnchen ist. Aber sie schmecken anders, wie vom Drehspieß. Und der Erfolg und die außerordentlich enorme Frequentierung des Lokals sprechen für sich selbst.
Wir sind regelmäßig mit Freunden in größeren Gruppen dort, was wir grundsätzlich ca. 14 Tage vorher reservieren.
Das Ambiente
Das Ambiente ist nicht das Neueste, gerade mit kleineren Gruppen sitzt man mit Fremden am Tisch, größere Menschen stoßen mit Nachbarn und Hinterleuten zusammen, es ist schwierig die Toilette zu erreichen. Und trotzdem 4 Sterne von mir...  -  Gerade die Punkte machen das Ambiente aus. Man kommt ins Gespräch, es ist eng aber nett, da fast niemand mit Besteck isst, hört man kein Geklapper... Man kann es nicht wirklich beschreiben, man muss ein einfach mal gesehen haben.
Sauberkeit
Die Sauberkeit ist in Ordnung. Je später der Abend, je wilder wird es. Brathähnchen sind fettig, (fast) jeder isst mit den Händen... Aber auch das gehört einfach zur Gockelburg.. I am in disbelief after reading some of the other reviews. I am actually upset with myself that it took eight years of living in Charlotte to go to Dish. I feel that I have missed out on the southern style cooking that they provide. After eating there I honestly felt welcomed into the south. It was amazing. The other reviews stating that the food was bland is surprising. The food I got was full of flavor. 

We ordered the meatloaf sliders to start, and for our entrees we order the chicken fried steak and the chicken and dumplings. The only mishap is that we did not receive the sliders until after our entrees arrived. They were busy and they did apologize for the mistake immediately and notified us that they were not going to charge us for them. I was not upset with them over this and it did not affect our experience.

There was not a lot of meat loaf in the sliders, but they were still very good and flavorful. The chicken fried steak was perfectly cooked. It was crispy on the outside, yet still very tender. It was topped with a white gravy over a bed of mashed potatoes. Both the gravy and mash potatoes were tasty. I did not feel that there was too much butter, which is some times typical to southern cooking. 

The chicken and dumplings were also very tasty. It did taste similar to the gravy that was on the chicken fried steak but also tasted slightly different at the same time. It was very good and was filled with large pieces of chicken and huge dumplings. The dumplings were super moist but not to the point where they were soggy and soft. We ordered mac and cheese for the side. The mac and cheese was very good, it wasn't anything overly incredible, but was satisfying.

Both meals came with a biscuit. I am not a big biscuit fan. Never grew up eating biscuits but I have had my share of biscuits since moving to Charlotte. These biscuits were by far the best I have ever had. They were so fresh, soft, moist, flaky. I wanted to order another one for dessert.

For what we got, I felt that the pricing was fantastic and actually on the cheap side. The majority of the apps are around $5 and the entrees were around $8. Sandwiches on the menu were between $5-$8. For two people, one appetizer, two entrees and four beers the tab was about $30. I do not know of many other places in Charlotte that I could of received a meal like that for that kind of money.. I enjoy going here for lunch since it gives me a sense of eating healthy when you cant prepare your own food at home. The Portobello Burger is great, and is really flavorful, whole the tofu tomato soup is amazing as well even on a hot Vegas day. It can tend to be a little pricey ($10-$20) per person, but the quality oversees the cost. Two thumbs up!. This place has the best General Tao &  Pad See Eiw.. I am so excited to be moving home to Madison in a couple of months for many reasons. 

One of them just happens to be my dentist, Dr. Ed Batchelor. What a guy. Kind, funny, and an outstanding dentist. His staff is top notch as well. The office is almost spa-like, and you leave with a bottle of water, chapstick, and a freshly-baked cookie (cue Midwest Express flashbacks...RIP). 

Dr. B and team secured their ranking when I had a dental emergency the week of graduation. I had gone out the night before (see Crystal Corner review) and lost my "flipper" partial denture-type thing. I was two days to graduation weekend and absolutely panicking because I assumed I would have to go toothless. I called the orthodontist who had provided the flipper originally, but they would have to send it to a lab which would take at least a week. So, I figured I'd give my dentist a call, assuming it would be the same response.

Instead, they do that sort of thing in house, and I had "new teeth" within 6 hours. Saved my college graduation weekend.

These folks are the pros.. I love this place. At Woo Che you have the opportunity to cook your own food. BEWARE you will smell like BBQ after you leave the restaurant so this would not be a good idea to bring a date to. It's really cheap too $12.95 for all you can eat lunch or 17$ for all you can eat dinner.. they had a variety of meats there from kalbi to bolgogi to fish and shrimp, as for your sides they had plenty salands, potatoe salads, rice and much more. I recommend this place if your into cooking your own food and into KOrean BBQ.. Attention to detail in this place is just awesome! Great back patio. Highly recommend it!!. Food is exception and always enjoy Steve's restaurants!  Server was a bit rude but I can overlook it since the chicken Parmesan was out of this world.  Fried mozz with meatballs is killer and the bread is straight from north east.  Can't go without telling you how good the housemate mozzarella is on top of the tender chicken rolling out the parm.  Excellent five stars all around wish we did dessert but I left half the portion of chicken on the plate because it was so big.  I also got gnocchi with sunday gravy because I can't resist trying Everyhthing on the menu when I dine.  So good & so bad ars #YoCuz I'll be back soon !!. Not sure how long Burgr has existed, but I only first got to try it yesterday for the first time.  Very good burger, but I dunno if it's worth the line that was building up when we finished eating.  Service was slow, but according to our server Tuesdays are like that.    My burger was top notch, the sweet potato fries were perfect, and there was a lot of good looking servers.  What's not to like, other than the pricetag?. This is a great place. I love going here for drinks or for nachos. In the summer there's also an awesome outdoor area. Really cool vibe. Whenever Im in the area, this place is always on my radar.

My only complaint is that on a couple of occasions, I have experienced two separate, rude, francophone servers (pretending not to understand my french, when most of Montreal does or at least appreciates the effort, except these types) who were only nice once my francophone speaking friends arrived. But.. still won't keep me away though. Nice place. :). To be quite honest, we were a bit underwhelmed when we arrived. The place looks like a little neighborhood café, no more, no less. There were only a couple of locals inside, which is not exactly a good sign on the usually crowded plateau. We selected a couple of waffles on their paper menu and had plain coffees, which were pretty boring (we're big 'ccinos fans). Again, underwhelmed to say the least, but don't be fooled: the main course is a show in itself.

The last time I felt so greedy about a meal was at Apollo, the well known restaurant of renowned chef Giovanni Apollo. Their plates are composed of waffles and delicately assembled sweet and salty treats that literally had me go crazy over what I should eat first. There was a little something to please all of my fancies in my plate, and it really gave me a sense off satisfaction that I honestly never experienced when having breakfast.

One of the plateau's best kept secret. Best bang for you buck in the neighborhood for sure.. Food was amazing, even the bread was great. Salad bar was good, side dishes were great 

Every piece of meat was perfectly cooked. They dont give you big slices which is perfect so you can try them all multiple time 

Ill be back to a Fogo in a different location. Went and saw the Moth there last night, which was really pretty good.

I guess my only thing with this place? The cash only deal? 

Let's fix that, especially at the bar.

Here, do THIS. If I HAVE to use our ATM inside because I am new to PGH and didnt know the dark ages were still here and credit cards arent being used? Then when I come back from the ATM with my receipt, you all should give me a shot a Jameson.

I am not even remotely kidding.

Other than that lots of bearded hillbilly types making googly eyes at women with lewd comments rounded out the evening.

Four stars? it's a great room...the show was cool. 

But no, really, ATM receipt for a shot....NOT KIDDING. MANY other places do that.. Price is high but fast food and great tasting. People are very friendly and seem to no what's the best on the menu would eat here again. Love this place! Nestled in the side of the mountain, The Four Seasons is what you would expect from their properties. Smiling and friendly faces, exceptional service, a beautiful pool area and an atmosphere to help you relax. 
While both the restaurant and banquet food was good, it was not 5 Star. For these prices, it should be. Don't get me wrong, it was very good. Just not great. The lobby bar, Onyx, is small but get's hopping and is a welcome retreat from relaxation when you need some fun strangers to talk with. 
Having stayed here twice and visiting friends for cocktails on their patios, I can tell you the rooms varied greatly from huge to average in size. Some with lap pools and patios while others had private decks up against the hills. 
The wonderful smell of chiminea burning along the paths add to a delightful get-a-way. I highly suggest this resort if you are in the mood to relax. It's not near much so you won't be tempted to do anything. And that's my idea of a vacation.. Will was awesome!! My GE dryer was squeaking bad for a few months...yes, months.  I finally looked up a repair guy on Yelp, and Will was the best reviewed.  He lived up to expectations and more.  I sent him the model number/serial number and he came with the repair part in hand.  Not only did he repair the rollers, but also replaced the belt because it came with the kit.  He also gave me a military discount and I didn't even ask!  Super professional guy and really personable.  The kind of person who is easy to trust.. The pizza here is THE BEST in town. I grew up in New Jersey, and these pies would make the wise guys at the bada bing go bada boom, if you know what I'm sayin'...eh? EH? Capisce?. I called to make my appointment over the phone and I was surprised that I could not get a appt. the same day, which I was sort of sad about because I wanted my windows tinted right away. I knew that this was probably a good sign being that they were pretty busy and that I had to wait a few days. 

On the day of my appt. I showed up and the guy at the front verified my appt., and asked me what tint I wanted. I wasn't sure about hat to get and in my mind on the way there I was thinking that I would probably get 20% tint. The guy showed me the difference of a few different shades and we decided on the 15% all around which I'm happy I got. 

I went to wait in the small waiting room and they had wifi and cox cable provided as they do their work if you're going to stay. I expected to wait at least a few hours so I brought my iPad. Oh! They also have drinks provided like soda and water that are free. 

One hour later I has my car and was given the warranty and instructions on how to care for the car. 

Overall I was pretty happy with the tint job. They did do a great job and was impressed. There were a few smudge marks on the center console in the back because of their shoes probably but if was able to get it off. I was very observant as this was my two week old 2014 honda civic and it has somewhat of a light interior. Nothing crazy and they did not damage anything. 

Three weeks later I receive a small thank you card in the mail which was extremely cool! Don't think I've been to any company that has done this. It was handwritten, had my name and my car model which means they took the time. 

Thanks again Eco-Tint, for the great tint job and Grade A+ customer service!. Returned here after an absence of 20+ years and the county has definitely put some effort and $ into this park.  Arrived late afternoon in our new motor home and they were all ready for us, addressed us by name and called ahead to the campground to let the host know we were coming.  Host escorted us to site and ensured we were positioned correctly.  Newly installed 30/50 amp hookups & water spigots worked flawlessly.  We only checked out a few of the nearby trails but will definitely return to check out more.  It will be a bit easier to get there when the 303 is completed though.. Cudo's to AAA Mesa repair shop for hiring Debbie White. A very professional and experienced service writer,. Anyone who unfortunately reads Tiffany Z 's review can disregard it completely. My wife and I recently purchased a new house. We didn't want to bring the old furniture into the mix because it didn't match at all (according to my wife). So the search for the perfect living room set ensued. When we walked in to Leon Furniture we were greeted by Windy. Being a sales manager myself in another field it was rather refreshing to me that Windy was ready to make a sale but not pushy at all. Everyone knows that folks in sales get paid by selling their product. Windy knew her product like "the back of her hand" as they say... she taught me about the quality difference between her products and the competition's products. And she gave us a great deal on what we bought from her. As the need for more furniture in our new arises, we will be going back to see WINDY at Leon Furniture. Thanks for your help Windy. And remember, if you don't have people complain about you once in awhile,  you're not making enough sales!! See you again soon for all my furniture needs.. First time here and am very satisfied with what I had. Ordered the Jerk wings and the flavor blew me away. The menu has great selection of Jamaican style cooking. Not too large of a menu makes choosing what you want easy. Great place to come after a concert. If I didn't have a late lunch, would have tried the Oxtail entree. Next time.. Martin V was very nice, conversational, excellent service.

Coffee tasted great - better than the Starbucks that I've tasted in others across the country.. This is an excellent spot to hang out and see live music.  The previous owner and staff from The Sail Inn moved over here and so did all of the sick bands that used to play The Sail.  This is the spot if you love to see live jambands, funk, edm, bluegrass, rock, blues, and all kinds of cover bands.  For the true dead heads they have The Noodles, a GD tribute band playing every Sunday at 4:20.  You can also karaoke with a live band backing you on certain nights.. First time here and definitely not my last!  Super fast service, even faster food.  It's just around the southern corner of the target complex.. For my Grandfathers 75th birthday, my family threw a suprise party for him and used Green's as the caterers for nearly 100 people.

The staff were a pleasure to work with and knew thier stuff about planning the food at such an occasion to the point where me and my father (who were arranging the food) were genuinly impressed by thier input.

Over all,the food was of outstanding quality and cheap - at around £6 or so punds a person. There was also the option of hiring staff to serve the food, although this was not an option we took.. Café Mundo Cubano!..Excelente comida, las cervezas bien frías, buena música , un buen ambiente familiar, un buen servicio personalizado y distinguido de las meceras y su propietario..Me encanta este lugar..!!. Crab Corner was so impressive the first time we ate there, my wife and I went back with our friends the next night. 

just a great restaurant! The crab is awesome. Tried all their crab... Blue Crab was excellent and very authentic Maryland style. The king crab was juicy and sweet. Add seasoning and butter and it's probably the best king crab I've ever had. 

I usually don't care for snow crab but Crab Corner nailed it perfect. Sweet and juicy. 

Definitely ask for a bib because it will get messy. 

Crab Corner is a different style vs Hot n Juicy, so it's not quite fair to compare.. I came for a Pumpkin Spice ice blended today and it was great!  I also used the wifi to check email and send some out.

Good location with friendly staff!  It's close and I'm glad they're in the neighborhood!. Dorothy and her team were excellent at everyting they dd. It is a professionally run office and every procedure was explained thoroughly. I highly recommend the services that Karma offers. You will not be disappointed!. This place sure has changed a lot over the years - and for the most part, for the better.  They've updated their look since I was last here about 2 years ago with new furniture, paint job, decorations - looks more like a family Italian dinner place than the local, grimy-but-charming Italian lunch place I frequented.

The menu has been changed, and gone are the handful of lunch specials that could be had for $6-10 (this is what I miss), replaced by a single lunch special and a menu where most items are $10-15.  The food had always been good, and that has been maintained.

I still recommend their calzone - at $6.95 and $0.75 a topping, it's a reasonably priced lunch item that WILL fill you up (or provide an afternoon snack).  Italian sausage and basil pesto were delicious!  My friend was very pleased with the shrimp pasta (which he really should have made two meals of, but was wallowing in pleasant agony after finishing).

They still have a bar, and plenty of tv's, and think it likely still a good place to grab an after work libation and catch a game - but only if your part is small - it's not the largest place.

I'll be back for more calzone combinations!. Got the Bleu Cheese Burger to go based on a Yelp review.  Burger was really good and the Tots were pretty delicious.  Will be going back again. Had a great time here. The coffee is excellent - smooth without the bite of Charbucks. I had the Grilled Cheese made with Hook's 2 Year Aged White Cheddar - an Interntional Award Winner. The Grilled Cheese was served with a cute little bowl of Tomato Bisque Soup. There was an amazingly good jazz band playing - the Jason Kutz Quintet - and they were tight, synchopating and creating sheets of sound. Ancora is a great place - I'll be back!!. Definitely recommend this place. First time walked in and was greeted with sincerity. Not the fanciest looking place but im more attracted to the food and service. I will definitely be back to try more of their menu.. Thanks to Yelp, this is the only way you would be lucky enough to find a place like this.  I saw all the reviews and knew I had to make a visit the next time we were down that way.  I was suprised to see just how in the middle of nowhere the deli really is!  However, once inside, you quickly forget you are in a non-descript strip mall.  The Club sandwich was incredible.  I can't wait to go back to try the array of other meals that sounded tempting.. This is not only the best burger in Pittsburgh. It's also the best burger in the USA. Cooked to perfection. 

The home fires are off the hook too. 

There is other stuff on the menu but stick with the burgers. 

Great eats. When in Pittsburgh I will make time for a stop at Tessaro's.. Nice place to see a concert. 
There are different areas for the general admission tickets to watch. The main floor, left or right side of the stage and in the rear of the venue. Three large bars wiTh specials on beers and well drinks is always a plus. Sound quality is excellent and the staff here is very friendly.. Ate some wings here and watched a game here the other night. It was slow, which was okay with me because I got to post up in a recliner order some tasty wings and talk football with some other people in town. Hidden in the back of Binions is this little sports bar/cigar lounge. Come catch a drink and a game and enjoy yourself. If I ever stay downtown again, I'd definitely watch a game or two here. They serve the Chicago Brewing Co Beer from the 4 Queens which is tasty.. After driving by it on a daily basis to and from work I decided to give it a try. After all a place named Bacon has got to be a good spot right? The atmosphere was great, very comfortable for the morning. They have a full espresso bar as well to help jumpstart the mornings. A simple menu but some good offerings. I went with the protein pancakes (which I'm a big fan of in general) and they were awesome. They came with warm blueberries and whipped cream on the side but no need for any of that, as the maple syrup did enough. I will definitely be coming back to see and if I can try something other than the pancakes.. An amazing show, probably the best that Vegas has to offer, from the dancers to the way everything was set up to actually seeing Michael dance himself, it's a must go for all MJ fans. Maribeth has great vision and is able to translate desires very well into a tattoo.  Trust her, you will not be disappointed!  Shop is very clean, professional, and comfortable.  She does exceptional shading with extreme detail and she has a gentle touch. This tattoo healed far better than previous ones by others.. My first visit was a quick walk through to check the store out, grab some beer and leave. The store is amazing, from the graffiti outside to all the great beer inside and a freaking NES, what is not to love? I can hardly find Fullsteam Brewery in stores while I am in the Triangle, so imagine my surprise to find it here at Salud. I grabbed a growler and also saw they had growlers from Mystery Brewery in Hillsborough, NC...where I went to high school! The guy running the store said he went and got them himself, props. I am going to get some of that on my next trip. 

With a more concentrated selection than Total Wine, awesome store and fair prices; I think I found my new favorite beer store. Next time when I have time I have to play that NES though, for real.. The perfect traditional breakfast!  Lots of other varieties, going to have to return and try them all.  Very friendly and not afraid to say... Merry Christmas!  Love them!. Mood Swings is a fun and relaxing experience. I have never had a bad cut here. Since they use Aveda products, everything smells good in an herbal sort of way. The ladies are friendly, and so is Juan. Rachel usually cuts my hair and I must say, not only is she sharp with the shears, she is a great listener - about my hair and about everything else, too. Mood Swings is lucky to have her in their employ.. Ok so the room itself is not the Bellagio.   Every level of the staff was great    The driver to/from the airport was great.  Once there the staff was friendly and fast to check us in at 1 am from returning from Germany.  Breakfast was great.   The best was That Fabulously Comfy Bed!   Customer service is everything and this place gets that!!!!. This is formerly Legume Bar, and my friends and I have been frequenting after it opened 3 years ago since we live in the building above.  We've seen them go thru countless rounds of bartenders, menus, and decor changes, and we all unanimously agree it is perfect the way it is right now.

This is the bar we all wanted to live above. It is one long bar right when you walk in, made of dark wood, and the liquor is beautiful.  We come down for the best burgers in Pittsburgh every week.  When I say best burger, I mean it.  The meat is fresh ground 80/20 lean and fat. At medium rare, this thing sings to the red meat gods. So tender and juicy, never frozen, on artisan perfect buns with enough strength to hold the contents.  This is better than tessaros, better than eleven (big lean patty). In a different league compared to burgatory, brgr. The only burger that rivals it is Father's Office in Santa Monica / Culver City.

Do yourself a favor and come here.  Bar staff is like family, IPAs of all types always. on tap. I will dearly miss Butterjoint when I leave this city.. Always a very guilty pleasure. I don't remember what it's called but the one that mixes waffle cone into the ice cream is freakin' delicious. Obviously not good for the health conscious Surprisian, but as a treat every once and a while it is delicious.. The sage chicken benedict  is one of the best things I've ever eaten. 
Came here because of man v food, but kept coming back every morning because everything was so tasty.
The pancakes are HUGE, and tastes amazing.. I can't believe I haven't reviewed Hula yet. I love this place! 

They have great lunch, but most recently I was here for breakfast. Since I was staying overnight in Edinburgh, just across the street from Hula, I finally had a good excuse to go here for my porridge. As a bit of a morning ritual, I normally have a porridge and a big cup or pot of loose breakfast tea. So I was extremely happy to find out that I could have both of these things for breakfast here. 

After reading through the menu of porridge options I decided to go with their popular honey and blueberry porridge. I thoroughly enjoyed this with it's natural sweetness... and they give you a HUGE bowl of it. I had a lovely pot of Breakfast tea to accompany said porridge, and was more than pleased that they serve it at a nice strength unlike many other Edinburgh cafes. 

I'm always happy to return to Hula, and hope I get another chance for breakfast there in the future.. Great place! I just started getting into sushi and this place has an amazing selection of rolls and dessert. I lean towards the tempura rolls and they were really good. The place is a bit small and hard to find, but definitely worth it once you start eating.. When looking for a breakfast place & a restaurant has over 800 reviews, well, I knew we'd come here. 

A really clean & nice looking restaurant located in a strip mall. 

We had the Greek omelet, biscuits & gravy plus hashbrowns. 

The addition of garlic to the Greek omelet made it go from ordinary to extraordinary! Fresh ingredients & liberal use of feta cheese was tasty. 

The gravy was sausage, bacon & maple syrup. It was bad a**! Very different & lighter than usual gravy. Biscuits were homemade & were light and flaky.. Have to make a list for just fast food. This place is always an easy go to for some cheep not so mexican: mexican food. I still have yet to find a mexican pizza in a mexican establishment. Easy, cheep, good and drive through make this Taco Bell on of my weekly spots for a quick bite. I even tried the Dorrito Taco (meh not for me). I usually get the same drive through employee and she is always super nice.. Great jazz and blues restaurant by the elevator banks. I'd always hear live music whenever I'm leaving my room night for some fun. Today I decided to give it a try and came here for breakfast instead of the buffet for a change of pace. The food here was made fresh, all made from scratch so the wait pretty sucks but fresh is fresh. Price cost as much as the buffet so I was feeling a bit uneasy paying the same price for me meal when I can pay about the same or less as the buffet and have more variety. I ordered the Bananas Foster French Toast $13 and it was excellent but small. :( 

Our server Janel was very freindly and always checked on our table to see how we're doing and she did not disappoint. Her positive attitude helped us feel comfortable even though the price was too high and food portions were not generous. 

The layout of the restaurant resembles a blues and jazz theme with southern hospitality. They have posters of famous blues singers on the walls and the lighting is pretty dim and has a bar in the right near the entrance and another bar opposite of the dining area. 

I would come back during dinner when the it's more packed and for the live band. Minus one star for the price.. Quite simply, the food at Burgr was absolutely amazing and I would even say that this was by far one of the best burgers I have ever had.  We had the Britannia burger, and the mango chutney it it was a great taste pleaser.  The garlic fries are also a fantastic side, and enough fries for 2 to share.  The atmosphere was quite pleasant, although the 35 minute wait to get in was frustrating.  It would be nice if they accepted reservations or gave the ability to book on open table. 

Now here is my negative why I took a star away.  The girls at the front desk could have not been more disinterested in their job if they tried.  When we went up to ask how long of a wait, it seemed like we were doing nothing but bother their petty little discussion.   Not cool.  As for the waitress, she took quite a while to get our order, someone else brought it out, which I was appreciative of as I didn't want to wait all day, and lastly, once we were done, no waitress to be seen.  A bus boy cleaned our plates up and when I finally asked the hostess for our waitress to bring our bill, the manager ended up bringing it to us.  This didn't seem right.

In short, go for the burgers as they are absolutely unreal, but flip a coin if you will get decent service or not.  Just don't be in a rush when you go!

Enjoy!. Was there at the Monastery sunday for the 2nd. annual chili cookoff.  Had a great cook it yourself 1/2 lb. burger, great food.  They have a huge outdoor play area with 2 sand VB courts and alot of other activities.  Very nice place to hang out and have a beer and some food and games.  Oh by the way I took 2nd., should have been 1st. out of 19 entries.in the chili cookoff. And thats t from "The Truth". For the guys. 
I'm in Montreal from Toronto and happened to find this place because it was open on Monday.  
I got my hair cut from Sam, he's originally from France so his english is OK, but he's really cool and he really enjoys practicing his english.  He gives probably the best fade I've ever had, and you can tell he really wants you to leave there looking Sharp.  

The price was a little more then I'm used to at $50 but your getting a relaxing wash and condition then Sam takes his time make sure you look good and not a single hair is out of place.  

Even for the price I made sure I came back a second time before heading back to TO. 

Cheers, 
J.V. This was my second Cirque du Soleil show.  I had seen Ka the previous night.  It was a completely different experience and one more akin to what I feel Cirque du Soleil should be.  

The show was a great blend of humor with amazing acts of acrobatics and strength.  Prior to the show starting there was a member of the show who came out and pretending to help guests find their seat, only to screw around with them and it made for a good laugh.  The show itself was fantastic.  A lot of acrobatics such as jumping on trampolines and swinging from trapezes.  I enjoyed the humorous parts of the show as well and there was good audience interaction too.

Our seats were pretty good, we were in the upper level, but had a good view of the stage and the acts.  I would go so far as to say almost all of the seats in the house are good except for the ones on the far right or left of the stage.. I tend to log in online, order a book and pick it here. Its fast and efficient. The self-checkout machines are a breeze to use, and the hold shelf is well-organized.

Good selection of DVDs and CDs. More can be delivered, just place a hold and have them shipped here. Excellent way to catch up on TV series' that you missed out on.

One problem is the fiction section seems to pack in a lot of books by "big" authors. If you like reading what everyone else reads, you'll be well served. If you like searching out new or lesser-known authors - they have them, but often they'll have books 3 and 4 of a series - so you'll have to order 1 and 2 from another library first.

The culture passes go quickly - so line up early if you want one!. Delicious food, incredible service.

Went with a group of six people and all the food ordered was fresh and well prepared.  Some dishes of note were the green curry (ordered medium, nice amount of spice, although not for the meek) and the pad prik khing.  The chili garlic sauce on the latter was delish.  The perfect amount of sweet and spicy. 

The owner was there and made excellent recommendations to those in the party who did not know what to order.  We will certainly go back.

This restaurant compares favorably to Thai Basil, which we also like very much.. Nothing fancy just great sandwiches made quickly by nice folks. They are moving next door soon so we'll see how the menu evolves.. Great place to go and dial in your personal weapons. I love being able to bring my own firearm and ammo and get some practice in. They are very friendly and even have military discount. The staff pretty much knows everything and they have an awesome selection you can choose from.. This place serves the absolute best, over the top hummus I've ever enjoyed!! I've consumed hummus from all over the globe while serving in the military, and must say, you feel "in country" while dining in this establishment!! From the chicken to the beef, Yalla is a winner in everything they prepare. If you go away hungry, its your own fault. The meals are plentiful, with every sauce and condiment imaginable. Enjoy!!!!!!!. Best Japanese restaurant in Vegas...well I've only tried this one but I am sure a lot of people will agree. We had the hamachi collar, kinki sashimi and grilled, foie gras on a skewer, agedashi tofu, foie gras and tofu, butter sauteed scallop with soys sauce, direct flamed eggplant, poached egg with sea urchin and salmon roe, and some kobe and pork skewers. It was a very memorable food experience and I have no problem suggesting this restaurant for it's high quality food and service. Be sure to check it out if you are in Vegas and want to eat more than just Sushi rolls for Japanese food.. Best lunch spots at the Biltmore if you are looking for a fairly well priced sushi selection.  I am a big fan of their bento's, they pack them with two salads, lettuce and cucumber and finish them off with your favorite fish, chicken or meats.  Did I say these bentos include miso soup and rice? BOOM!  If you are looking for top quality sushi, I would say they have okay selections but really not too many places in town have this.  I have not been here for dinner so I will just give them a respectable 4 stars for the consistent lunch experience.. I'm afraid to admit- my wife and I visit this Einstein way too often. We're 100% dedicated drive-thru users, and stick to a usual regimen. Two toasted bagels (typically garlic, sesame, or everything) with two specialty coffees. My wife prefers their hot vanilla latte and I'm the iced caramel machiatto addict (asking for the caramel to be melted and mixed into the espresso to make for a smoother drink). It's a $15 tab and we spend it at least 2-3 times per week.

The drive thru is typically speedy, with nice service. Obviously weekend mornings are  a little busier than others but that's to be expected, right? The staff still gets you through quickly and with a smile. 

The breakfast sandwiches are a good alternative- and offer some calorie conscious eaters options (turkey sausage and no cheese anyone?)... if you are calorie counting stay away from the blueberry muffin bites. Just trust me on that one.

You're always apt to see folks with their pets camped out on the small patio space, so it's cool to see the pet-friendly space. Even though it's a typical breakfast chain, it's a great alternative to other fast food places like McD's or BK. The coffee is good, food is great, and staff friendly! 

And don't forget they offer lunch items- lunchmeat sandwiches served on a bagel of your choice. The taste options are practically endless. Enjoy!. My brother, friend, and I  went in here for lunch to get some dim sum.  It was very good.  Good portions and reasonable prices.  Will definitely come here again if I'm in the area.  Highly recommended!. My son and I were in Vegas again so we decided to eat lunch at Wo Fat again.  We ordered four dishes since there were only two of us but we could not finish all that we ordered -- maybe we should not have eaten some of that rice too.

We ordered deep fried kau gees, oyster sauce cake noodle, stuffed duck, and beef bitter melon.

Here are the photos of what we ate.. Good food, not great but priced fair working man eats. Good breakfast and lunch. I bring my coworkers here.. Excellent place.  Warm brick walls.  Very knowledgeable foodie-waitress.  Great selection of small plates nicely presented and extensive wine list.  Will def go back numerous times!. If you ever visit Fountain Hills, you must stop off for breakfast or lunch at this remarkable Bagel shop. My wife and I had lunch there. I ordered a peppered turkey with salami and pepper jack cheese on an everything bagel. The bagel was toasted just right...not burnt. They aren't stingy on the meats either. When you get your sandwich, you wonder how in the heck are you going to take a bite out of it, cause it's huge!! For the sides, instead of ordering chips, you can have potato, pasta or cucumber salad. My all time favorite is the cucumber salad which has cucumbers, scallions and celery. It is a refreshing salad. 

This place is a whole lot better than going to Chompie's.. Are you looking for Hispanic goods? Well this place is your one stop shop! I mean really, it's got it all from brand name to some obscure Hispanic brand that only a Latino would know about. Also it's pretty big and smells kind of funky from all the spices in here if that's your thing.

What did I go here for? I came here for a big ass hunk of flan. Yes you read that right, they have a cool pastry section and flan is one of my favorite desserts. Smooth creamy, and sugary this flan is just as good as anywhere else and a few bucks gets you a huge slice! Everything else? I have no idea since this is pretty much just a giant flan stand to me, but the selection for people who actually do groceries here looks quite expansive.

So uh come here if you're looking to make some Hispanic cuisine and can't find some obscure ingredient, or if you're like me and love flan. As a bonus you can play a game and take a shot every time I mention flan in this review, can you reach the last flan (this one) without being drunk? If so then you may be an alcoholic, let's be friends?. We actually wanted to eat at Martinelli's but is was like a haunted house. No lights on...so we chose Thai Cuisine instead.

When we go there around 6 PM on a Wednesday, theater night, "Cirque Illuminations" and was asked if we had reservations. We told them no and she said it would be awhile...had to ask what 'awhile' was and she replied 30-45 minutes. The place was packed and since there weren't that many restaurants around this location, we decided to wait. There are only two servers for 40+ patrons.

We were seated at 6:40 PM...and we all ready decided on the dishes:  Pork Spicy Basil (Pad Gra-Prow) and Shrimp Pad See-Ew. 

We started with a house salad which was okay with a dressing that was very tasty. The service was very slow and when we received our food, it was 7:00 PM.  Twenty minutes to eat, pay the bill and get a to go box. 

My wifes dish,  Pork Spicy Basil, was very flavorful and both of us enjoyed that more than my  Shrimp Pad See-Ew. The menu for this item stated Chinese broccoli...of which I saw about 1%, the rest being American broccoli.

I brought my noodles home to eat the next day...it was yummy. I will be visiting this place again, but this time, I'll call ahead to make a reservation.. Really liked this place.  As many others have said, it feels like an upscale Cheesecake Factory.  This means you're going to have tons of variety, a massive menu, and some good free bread.  We had to wait about 5 minutes for a table (a massive rush came in after us).  The space is huge.  There are so many tables in the back area, so the fact that it was full at 4:30-5 p.m. is a good sign.  We had some edamame to start, which was nicely seasoned and came with a great dipping sauce.  I ordered the fried chicken, which came with creamy, delicious mashed potatoes and coleslaw with peanuts.  The whole thing was delicious.  I think I ended up with about 5 pieces of fried chicken, which was a lot, so I was unable to finish it.

A little tip for those going, if you are wanting to conduct business or use your smartphone in the back area where most of the tables are, you're going to have a hard time getting a signal.  This could be good for conversation with family, but potentially difficult if you're trying to conduct business.

I would highly recommend this place.  I was a little nervous going to a sit down place at the Venetian because you never know what the pricing will be, but the Grand Lux Cafe was very reasonable.  My wife and I got drinks, an appetizer, and two full-sized entrees and spent around $40 before tip.  Check it out!. Well, I'll start with the negatives. I found the place to be too noisy for my liking.   Yes, I was there during a busy lunch service with virtually every table in use.  But still the noise level was a bit much.  I think they could have tweaked the acoustics a bit.  Also for a restaurant based on the use of simple, fresh pure ingredients that are locally and or organically grown to create a healthy and flavorful menu; I would expect to find a few more vegan and vegetarian entrees (please note I am neither vegan nor vegetarian, I just prefer veggie dishes). I would also like to see a selection of pure raw food entrees and by raw I don't mean just salads.

Okay, having said that, neither of these issues is a deal breaker nor will it keep me from returning.

Now for the positives; to start off I was told that I would have a five to ten minute wait for a table or I could elect to take a seat at the counter.  I elected to wait for a table and I'm glad I did.  The wait was only eight minutes, so bonus point #1 for keeping with your estimated wait time.

Bonus points # 2 thru 10 go to my server.  Honestly, I forgot his name but on my receipt it shows the server's name as Makyle so I'll assume that is correct.  Makyle was a breath of fresh air, the first thing he served up was a genuine welcoming smile. I can't stress enough how important that is in the restaurant business.  He seemed very happy to work at this restaurant and seemed to have a genuine passion for the place. He started by asking if I have ever been here before and if I knew anything about this restaurant.  When I told him I had never been here and only knew what little I had read. He asked if I wanted to know more and then told me the history and philosophy behind the place.  I found it very interesting and I was impressed by their affiliation with Dr. Andrew Weil and how the entire menu is centered on the principals of Dr. Weil's Anti-inflammatory food pyramid.

Makyle's service was absolutely first-rate.  Possibly the best service I have found in Phoenix other than at a mega-dollar establishment.  Despite being extremely busy he checked in on all of his tables in a timely fashion, kept the water glasses topped off and offered to get you anything you may have wanted like a second drink.

Décor: Bonus point # 11. The décor is very modern-urban-upscale and very appealing to the visual senses. As I mentioned in my opening, they could have done a better job on the acoustics.

Cleanliness: No bonus points. I found it overall clean but with some room for improvement. It looked like they missed a few spots when they cleaned off my table.  Nothing terrible, no sticky mess just not 100%.

So, what did I order and what did I think about it?
I started with one of their natural refreshments.  I'm a big fan of fresh juicing and it was nice to see this offered on the menu.  I ordered the Cucumber Refresher and it was just that, very refreshing. Bonus points # 12 thru 14

For my entrée I ordered the Spaghetti Squash Casserole.  This dish has spaghetti squash with organic tomato, zucchini and fresh mozzarella, and is served piping hot (bonus point # 15) in an individual casserole dish.  What can I say, it was to die for, it was perfect, the ingredients and seasoning achieved a perfect balance where you can taste every ingredient without anything overpowering any other taste (bonus points # 16 & 17).  Now I almost never eat cheese so I could have done with a little less cheese on top but even so it was not overpowering the dish. I was hungry and found the portion size just right. I'm glad it wasn't larger because it was so tasty that I would have consumed the whole thing. First rate and I will highly recommend this dish.

The experience was wonderful and I will return.. I like the way they do my interior, I have never had interior cleaning. They are efficient. Usually more than one person to help dry and dress your tires (if you get that). I will take Laurie V's word on them being kinda hot. Thought the food tasted great!  I ordered the Lo Mein, Sesame Chicken, General Tso's Chicken, and Sweet & Sour chicken.  Fast prompt service.  Easy to pick up and run.  Wished the General Tso's was a little more spicy and hot.  They package their food well so that you can save it for another day.  Prices were very reasonable!  Egg rolls were okay and so was the Crab Rangoon.  Good Take-Out!!!!. This is now my favorite nightclub on the strip. The music is good and many notable DJ's spins here. We had Avicci our weekend and we all know how bad ass he is. House and Trance is what's hot now and that is what Marquee offers. It's the hottest day/night club at the moment in Vegas which means beautiful people that comes with it. Marquee in the Cosmopolitan resort is a 60,000 square foot venue with three different rooms that plays different music but mainly electronic.  

I strongly recommend getting a table if you have a large group. We had a group of 10 dudes and got a table right inside the entrance between the main dance floor and pool area. It was a good spot where the DJ was clearly visible and also the breeze that came in from the pool area. If you don't get a table, the wait can be hours in line depending who is spinning that night. 

The place is jammed pack meaning shoulder to shoulder when the DJ comes out, which is around 1am. This is where having a table comes in handy. Waiting at the bar to gets drinks during this time is almost impossible with all the shoving and drunks. The decor is very modern with a purplish theme to it. It's a perfect vibe to get your drink on and party! People here are friendly and attractive from the party goers to the employees. I had no issues at all through out the whole night and had a blast.. Just an awesome experience. Can't recommend it enough.   If you feel like a unique experience be sure to schedule some time with Cortney for a straight edge shave.. Great dining experience! Fun place to try new things and share with others in your party. The Charcuterie and Cheese Platter was a great sampler of unique items and the Duck Fat Fries were without a doubt the best fries I've ever had! The rabbit was great as well as the scallops. Service was excellent and the speed at which the food came out was pretty incredible for how busy they were. Top notch and bill was very reasonable for the meal we had.. I tried the Drunken noodles with prawns.  The prawns were big and juicy.  It was delicious!  Can't wait to go back.. Have you been to Colorado? I haven't. I hear it's pretty amazing. I am relatively sure John Denver himself touched down and created Cafe Davio just to give man a taste of the Rockies rolled into the best breakfast you've ever had.

Bold statement you say? Well then.. try a hot cup of Joe..the hash browns..the delicious omelets with the more than fantastic blackberry jam on some toast and I think you will agree.

Go there skeptical and you will leave more than delighted by your mistake in attitude choice.. We ate here twice in our recent visit to Caesars Palace. The fish and chips were the best I have eaten. We also had our first lamb burger. It was delicious! The staff were very attentive and the Manager Randy made sure our visits were memorable. Chef Scott is doing a fantastic job. You did it right Gordon! Thank you all so much. We will definitely return.. Great January day to sit out side.  The San dabs were great for lunch.  Also the squash soup was excellent.  Great service. Service great manager John went above and beyond to make our visit a great experience, John we will be back thank you. Great food. Ordered nachos, cheese & bacon fries, and sample platter. Fast and friendly service. Clean dining area and restrooms. I live in the area so I will be back.. One word.....Amazing. 
The owner, Phil, was really friendly. I dont understand how people could rate this place so low. The price was slightly a little high but it was worth the extra dollar. You have to go this restaurant and try it for your self. Because some of the reviews on yelp has to be false. Great healthy meal.. Matt Thomas is a connoisseur. It was my 21st, I've been test tequilas all night long and he's the only one who recommended me something different than the average. The vibe is chill and the man is a genius . If you want good times and experience; check out the blasted brewery!. A welcome addition to the businesses in this part of the Valley. This large store is clean, spacious, and has a very wide variety of fresh produce, meats (including many kinds of organ meats), seafood, cooking utensils, and other items. Here you can find packaged and canned goods from several countries, including India, Africa, and the Mediterranean area. As with any big Asian food store, part of the pleasure in shopping here is discovering many items that you will not find in most food stores, big or small. The prices are good, so load up on stuff like coconut milk, curries, dried seaweed, exotic spices and seasonings, and other items for your culinary adventures.. I would eat here everyday if I lived closer.  Excellent tacos!  Pastor, pollo, carne asada, carnitas....I get two of each every time I go.

I'm a pig.  I don't care.. It's a no kill shelter. It looks kinda small and with 600 or so cats and 200 dogs, you can't expect it to be spotless or the best living conditions.

They're in need of families to foster pets. We fostered two baby labs for several weeks until it was time for them to get spayed/neutered then put up for adoption. So, if you're afraid of commitment, try it out and take a couple dogs for a few weeks knowing that you can return them (or adopt them) down the road.. I really like this place a lot better now that they've moved from the Borgata.  It's a nice open floor plan and I love the outside patio and bar area.  My pizza was great and I'm pleased to see their nice selection of Italian wines.. Great on the go! Milkshakes are amazing, burgers fantastic, and price no my bad.  This is the best alternative when Chic-fil-a is closed and you can't take another day at McDonalds. Change it up.  Service is slower, but still amazing grub!. Immediate and attentive service on a busy pre-game evening! Excellent Pittsburgh appointment!!. I just want to thank you for always having enough carts/scooters to get around the store in......... Allison found a tenant for our rental home in about a week.  Unlike the last agent that I used, she did not charge me for the renter's agent's commission.  I thought she paid great attention to her job and gave awesome recommendations.  Being an out of town owner, I thought Allison went above and beyond her duties as an agent for us.

The thing that impressed me the most with Allison is her integrity.  I couldn't decide whether I wanted a new tenant for my home or to sell the home.  Most agents would have jumped at the chance for me to sell the home so that they can make more commission.  Allison, however, went out of her way to rent the home out because she could tell that we really didn't want to sell the home.  Hard to find honest people like Allison these days!!. I'll admit straight away that I do not have the most experience with Vegas shows. Some, but not a hell of a lot.

That said, if you have a chance to go see *this* show and don't immediately jump on it, we are no longer friends.

We saw Absinthe as a farewell to Las Vegas after a week of work. It's hilariously funny (read: really fucking dirty, leave the kids home) and visually stunning. I know you're wondering so I'll just lay it on you: yes, there are tits.

I'm trying to not go into too much detail here because you really need to see it first hand but, it's a bit of comedy, bit of acrobatics, bit of burlesque and WELL WORTH THE MONEY. Teller (of a little group you may have heard of starting with Penn) was sitting 2 rows in front of me and then stuck around after the show to play with the acrobats. Nuff said?. This was some of the tastiest Thai food I've had in LV. The chicken coconut soup was really great and served in a bowl with a small active volcano in the middle to keep it hot. They brought us a double order of egg rolls-we only ordered one. My wife had yellow curry that was great, my one complaint being that the curry broth was a little too white and had just a hint of "curry" flavor. Also there wasn't quite enough of the broth that I am used to with other places. It was more thick like a sauce. These are minor complaints about the dish as overall it was quite good. We will definitely go back! 

Ignore what your GPS says-it is on the Northwest corner of Pecos and Nellis. My GPS is nearly 10 years old though...... The food here reminded me of my moms home cooking,  I had gone on Valentines day and it was quite busy, so it wouldn't be right to judge the service as they were overwhelmed with people. But I would definitely go back for a bowl of that amazing  minestrone and that homemade tasting sauce...Mmmmm!!!. This was by far the best place to shop for our new home.  The service is incredible.  We had to do some returns/exchanges, and they could not have been more accommodating.  We visited two different pier one locations... and they were both equally great.  I like the way this company does business.. Interesting little cafe tucked in the back of an otherwise ordinary shopping center. The eggs Benedict was delicious, fruit was fresh, service was...okay.  I think the waiter was new, but it wasn't a big deal.  The food came out right and everyone really liked what they got. 

Final note, As we were getting up to leave, they were bussing the table when some coffee fell on one of the girls I was with. They were very apologetic and even offered her cash for any dry cleaning (which she rejected), accidents happen and they did the right thing.. Soooooo good... try it, you'll love it!. Both the savory an sweet crepes were phenomenal. The portions were appropriate, and you pay for the quality. Yum!. Great little Greek deli and something new and interesting in Lawrenceville. The owner's a nice guy and easy to talk to as well.

I've had their baklava and it was absolutely divine. I have yet to try the rice pudding but I plan on it.

On my first trip I had moussaka. It was like lasagna and was delicious. The side salad is nothing to write home about but the oil dressing was perfect and had that light, handmade touch that makes real dressing so much better than the bottled stuff.

On a second trip it was insanely busy due to their recent Groupon involvement. The service was slow but I had the feeling they simply weren't use to the amount of people coming in. Either way, my lamb gyro was delicious and the pita, as others have said, is perfect. Served warm and fluffy with a bit of crispiness on the outside.

Definitely give this place a try. It's an interesting place to dine because Stamatis changes the menu so often and uses high quality, local ingredients.

For a larger review, visit: http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2010/06/28/pastitsio-a-little-bit-of-greek-in-lawrenceville/. Seriously the best Carne Asada I have eaten in years! Tender juicy grilled flavor everything you could ask for in Carne Asada! The Al pastor is simply delicious. Great food great prices I would have given them five stars but their line and kitchen staff is a little disorganized but don't worry that's not enough to stop me from getting such great food!. This place lives up to the hype, plain & simple!  This is craft or artisan style pizza.  Real dough, real buffalo de mozzarella cheese, real tomato sauce, made in a wood fired over that adds some roasted charcoal-esque sabor to every bite.  

This ain't no Domino's, Pappa moran's, or Pizza shack nonsense, this is adult food that you will appreciate.  Some of their menu items are set made pizzas and some of them are a bit unusual.  I wanted a sausage, mushroom, onion, and cheese over red sauce & I ordered it (off menu) and they made it no problemo.  Amazing.  I'm sure their suggested pies on the menu are great too, but I like my apples to apples comparison.  Now I've had my fav I keep getting the same thing.  

Been there during business a couple times never busy for me because I was there at like 4pm on a weekday, or 30 minutes before closing on a weekday.  I hear it gets busy & there are lines during regular meal times, I don't wait for most places, but I would wait in line for this!. This place just opened up in the Bermuda Triangle that is Sahara Pavilion(sahara/decatur)

Grand Opening is May 8th in the old Spirit of Cuba location. 

Today they had a fundraiser to benefit Caring 4 Kids Foundation from 5-8 pm. $5 donation you can get ANY & Everything you want off the menu & a drink!

My son & I each got a burrito & chips/salsa-we got a barbacoa & chicken. They were huge with rice & choice of beans plus pico,guac & more. The meats were fantastic-real spicy.

The service was outstanding , the place was clean & inviting with music pumped in.

There are about 10 4 person tables and a few 2 person tables. Probably under 40 people seating indoors, but they have outdoor patio seating too.

The only missing is a salsa bar.

I'd rather go here anytime over Roberto's & Baja Fresh in this neighborhood.. Yummy new Las Vegas AYCE sushi addition, this one also serves Korean style tapas!  The sushi and sushi rolls quality is excellent, with excellent service to boot.  Come later, as the place gets really busy in prime time and you'll get better, faster quality service when there are fewer customers there.  They're open until 3am, so there's time to get hungry so you can indulge.  Highly recommend ordering half rolls so you can enjoy different varieties.  

The place is very big and located in the original area of Chinatown before it expanded several city blocks; plenty of parking too as it shares a large parking area with the shopping center.  Besides sitting at the bar, there's plenty of tables.  The waitress came around quite often to make sure they get in all your orders, or you can sit at the bar and directly tell the sushi chef what rolls you want.  Interestingly, they do serve sashimi, but it's one of the ones that you're only limited to 3 pieces.  If sushi isn't your thing, they have quite a bit of non-sushi items such as galbi, okonomiyaki, noodles, fried rice, kalbi, dynamite, gyoza, calamari, and skewers to name a few though some you're limited to ordering one per customer.  

As for sushi and roll choices, there's quite a lot of variety and they don't skimp on having originals.  Besides standard sushi rolls, there's a full page of specialty rolls and signature rolls, which I had thought was the same thing but I guess I'm wrong.  I ordered the Something Wrong (soft shell crab with shrimp with salmon, tuna, and dakon on outside), WTH Roll (soft shell crab and cucumber with tuna, spicy crab and jalapeno on outside), and Rock & Roll (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, avacado with cucumber wrap).  They were all covered in sauce but were really good, especially considering it was an AYCE place.  I also ordered a couple of gizzards, galbi, miso soup, sashimi, salmon sushi, and urchin.  I didn't have room for dessert but they have various ice cream including tempura ice cream and something called banana dream.  

The price is $25.95 per person (for 60 min), drinks are extra.  Definitely worth going to especially if the other AYCE places have a long wait!. We came in for lunch with the wife and were blown away. This place isnt just a restaurant, it's an experience! The food was amazing and the staff (Ana and Carl) was attentive and super cool. We will gladly come here again!++. I like this kinda pizza. Floppy and thin with a thick non greasy flour dusted crust. The pepperoni and sauce, very tasty. Over all hey for 7 bux I would rather buy this than at some overpriced chain. Further more I got wings,fries, a drink and a 16" pepperoni for 15 bux! Cant get that at ANY national brand pizza chain, you would looking at damn near 40 bux! Yes, they seem a lil cranky but who cares foods good and its cheap. I can deal with a little lack of service to save a fistfull of cash. I would also like to add, I dont know who she is but the cashier was a dark haired beauty. Again, great pizza, great price and a little eye candy to boot. Im not complaining! The interior of the restaurant isnt as cold and sterile as I thought it would be from pictures I found online. Its actually quiet, they're is plenty of room for a large party or if its just a small family of three. Heres the BIGGY! When you drive into the complex from sahara, your going to drive through the shopping center and turn left at the end. and then a another left to its front door Its directly across from fit for ten.. Un-be-freakingly good steak. Incredible! Service was a tad slow but I'm American so maybe I'm just not used to French service. I'd definitely go back next time I visit.. THIS REVIEW IS NOT FOR THE HOTEL because I didn't stay there. This is for the observation deck, bar, and casino. WOW.....beautiful freakin view from the observation deck. I could literally sit there for hours and stare. Worth more than $20 dollars, especially when there is a pretty awesome bar and gift shop at the top. Can't remember the bartenders name, but he was beyond friendly and made my wife and I laugh a couple times. I don't know if I will ever go on the thrill rides, but the Sky Jump definitely sparked my interest. The ground did shake a few times when we were up there, scary, but I'm assuming completely normal. Oh and ladies if you plan on going to the outdoor observation deck keep in mind that it does get windy so don't wear a skirt (the wife did and flashed all of Vegas from 855ft.). The casino is on the small side, but does have a nice lounge and attentive waitresses. I won $160.00 there on one machine.. I have always enjoyed my Tropical Smoothie, but check this out; I had no clue that you could get them to mix practically anything...

Peanut Butter + Banana + Coffee = New Magic!

Also, the Early Bird breakfast wrap is my GO TO for food. Everything they serve is yummy.

This particular location is family friendly and welcomes a great deal of natural light.
Don't forget your punch card!! (On this trip, I did... sad mikey). Quite tasty though in lebanon u can find tastier ones.
Bit pricy I felt... This is a crafts store with a good selection and decent prices.

Some of the selection are somewhat harder to find elsewhere, which surprises me because I would not expect to find a place like this at the busy, touristy Cockburn Street . I have to say many items are also in Crate-and-Barrel stores back in the states, with one exception: it's cheaper here by about 20%. So, if middle class craft items appeal to you, you might be in luck.

I know many of these items appeal more to women then men; but I know what my girlfriend likes and this stores has stuff that would make her heart melts. The peacock feather pattern centerpiece bowl is beautiful and is hard to find elsewhere (tell her it's made from recycled glass and she will faint at your brilliant and yet environmentally-conscious mind :-).  I would definitely give it a check-out if there is a chance.. My vacation pictures can be categorized into three categories: 

- Pictures of Fountains
- Pictures of Statues
- Pictures of Churches

Its almost a Pavlovic response when I'm in a foreign city and I see one of the above (I automatically take my camera out and snap, another one for my collection).  

St Joseph's is not a well known attraction in Montreal, but it should be.  It reminded me of Sacre Coeur in Paris - its a large domed church on a hill with a nice view.  Parking is $5 and admission inside the church is free (as it should be).  Admission to the church museum is $4, but it did not seem interesting.  There are a lot of places to explore and take great pictures (inside the church, garden, view from the top, view from the bottom, etc).  If you look carefully on the premises, you can find my vacation picture trifecta: church, statute, and fountain.. Very good food.  I have eaten here several times and have had no complaints with their execution.  Really nice patio area secluded in trees and shade with a full service bar in the middle.  Great place for lunch.  One of Tempe's gems.. We go there for most of our fresh foods, it doesn't have the feel of a neighborhood grocer but the quality and selection are terrific.. I just had a beautiful trip down memory lane. Delicious peppery curried goat, rice and peas, stewed cabbage and early 90's dancehall Reggae on the sound system. This spot has been know by many names in the past and it looks like it goes by Impressionz now. But trust me, the food is authentic. Not fancy, but the true Jamaican experience. I haven't tried anything else on the menu, but I'll be back.. Great experience and golf course. Joe M and the pro shop staff are excellent!  I played Saturday as a single from Chicago and was paired with a member, Rick A, really great guy. From the check in to the starter on Saturday, great experience overall, however a 6:10 t time took 4.5 hours and at that time of day, 2 nd group out, was far too slow a pace. I then played Sunday as a single again and had a 7:10 slot but was hoping to get out earlier so I showed up before the first slot at 6 am. I checked in and then went to the starter, not the same guy as Saturday, so I let him know. Then I see a 3some teeing off at 6:10 and figured the starter forgot but he said nope, no openings.  This guy was pretty surly to non members of a course open to the public, needs some serious customer service training.  I was paired with a guy from LA and a 11yr old gal with her father from Wales.  Good time for 18 at 4 hours after 7 am. All in all love the course and all the staff I met except the Sunday starter.  Would play there again and again!. Unbelievable French fare  --lunch and brunch place, with a full bakery and kitchen. We had rip roarin chocolate eclairs with ham & gruyere cheese sandwiches on an exceptionally fresh baguette bread. Such a wonderful place and a bakery well known in Montreal and highly recommended to us by some colleagues. This place absolutely did not disappoint and it felt just like being in an authentic French bakery. It was also one of the very best bakeries we were in in the city. Don't forget to top off the meal with a cafe au lait or an espresso. We also decided to keep things French by grabbing an Orangina on ice. GO HERE!!. Fix is a nice, trendy, and fairly loud restaurant.  The lobster tacos were superb. I could have eaten 8 of them. There are three to an order. The shells were crispy and lobster bouncy (fresh). The veal chop was the best I've ever had. It was very tender and the red wine reduction sauce had a nice bite to it. The mushrooms on top of the veal added nice flavoring as well.  I didn't enjoy the side of mushrooms (part of side section on menu) though; they were too buttery for my taste.. This place is my go to spot for lunch! Amazing chorizo, chicken, pork & steak tacos. Can't get much better from a price ($2.50 for a taco) or taste stand-point. The stand is outside a small Mexican convenience store so customers can get drinks etc. from inside. People have to pay inside the store first and then come outside and order the tacos. They have an great variety of condiments including fresh cilantro, guacamole and varied level of hot sauces! Can't go wrong with this place.. YUM!  It's pretty good fast-food tacos.  The best is going on $1.50 fish taco Tuesdays.  My wife and I go almost every week.. Best pizza I have eaten in years. The Cesar salad dressing in very good. Ordered 2 pizza s a red sauce and white sauce both very good. All-You-Can-Eat & High Quality Sushi are normally two things that I wouldn't associate together. Until now. Their full menu is available for the AYCE price, and it's a very wide menu. The rolls and cuts are made to order and the fish was very fresh. I love that you can order half-rolls so you can try lots of different ones. I had my doubts as to how good this place would be after my friends had talked it up so much, but I was not disappointed. I must've tried at least 9 different types of rolls, a couple of handrolls, tuna poki and we finished off with a refreshing lychee sorbet that cleaned the palate wonderfully. 

Service was definitely on top of it and the sushi chefs behind the counter seemed very enthusiastic and were having fun being there. The place isn't very big, so even full, all of our food came out very quickly and our table waiter came back frequently to find out our next orders. It took some effort to control myself from ordering everything on the menu, but I believe my heart appreciated it. 

I think a return to Sushimon will be a must for my next trip to Vegas.. My wife and I liked this place. We needed a quick bite to eat before we went to the outlet mall to do some shopping and this place was just what the doctor ordered. We ordered a couple slices and we loved it. Quick service good pizza.. There is no shortage of "New York Style" pizza places in the Charlotte area - especially as you get up to the Northeast. Funny how that works. It's not like they put them on the South side of town. Almost like a mini-map of the country or something. Anyway.

Due Amici, while currently a bit challenging to get to because of (or due to) the 485 construction, is worth a slight drive out of your way. There are other places that are simpler to find, and some are even right off of the freeway. But take the time and find your way to Due Amici and you can find a number of slices that are well worth the effort.

Naturally they have things other than pizza, as any good joint will, but if it's right there in the name, should you really try anything else?. I don't eat at chili's too often, but i should because i have never had a bad experience there, but i don't like chains and franchises.  any way stopped there for lunch and had their pick 3 dinner dipper thing and it was great and not too much food, 2 mini burgers (excellent) chicken wings (excellent) and artichoke egg roll thingies (great too).  almost finished it all and very good, great service and pleasant.  anything i can do to stimulate the economy.. Right near Monta Ramen.  Fantastic dessert for the hot desert!  Staff is really friendly.  Green tea shaved ice is really good.  Small size is generous and easily feeds two folks.. Food was quite tasty and our server Shane was fantastic! Love happy hour and the wings and chili cheese fries. We will definitely be coming back.. This place is BOMB. For $5, I got the best burger I have ever had, some delicious and perfectly seasoned fries, and a drink. How do you beat that? And the guy behind the counter (Brandon) is really energetic and nice. You need anything, just let him know and he takes care of you. The first time my friend and I went in there, he asked if we had been before, we answered no, and he gave us the whole meal for $3 and thanked us for coming in. I was already sold and I hadn't even tasted the food.

The place is also real quaint - total hole in the wall/dive with a really cool patio out in the back. There is literally no reason for anyone in the Phoenix area to have not tried this place and had it completely change their life.

That's about it.. Delicious food, great selection of meats and sides and even free ice cream and pickles.  I love that they offer every kind of meat..pulled pork, brisket 2 ways, chicken, ham, turkey and sausage and that the sides are a good size for the money and they have a good selection of sides so no matter what you are in the mood for this is the place!!. Ray's has great pizza. I was born and raised on Brooklyn... so I think I an say safely that I know what a "Ray's" pizza should be like. And this place is pretty close. 

I am NOT a fan of their chicken wings... sorry. I HATE chicken wings that sit on an inch of the wing sauce. I know some people do like it that way... I do not. Redendo's (down the street) has way better (crispy) wings.

Ray's does have a great variety of gourmet style pizza. Most is available in "slice" format. The prices are reasonable... if leaning towards the expensive side. 

I like the pizza in the "window"... very reminiscent of my NYC days.. best french dip ive had in a long time my wifes bbq platter was good too she really liked the ribs the only down side of this place is the wait and its just too dang dark its nice to see the food your eating. This isn't the normal Firehouse Subs I go to, but I was in the area.  Service was fast--there was no one in the shop but me.

The tuna sub was as good as I get at the normal shop.  

I am a fan.. Surprisingly I enjoyed the meals here. I wish I would have known that the nachos were HUMONGOUS. I kind of found the Parmesan nachos on the salty side. It definitely helped that I washed it down with an ice cold beer. This place is a chill sports bars. I love the view from that spot because you can overlook Vegas. Eastern and st rose is one of my favorite areas in Vegas. 

Next time that I visit, I definitely wanna try some of the other meals on the menu. I recommend trying this spot out.. Chicken fingers are made fresh, even coming from a fast food chain. Way better than Popeyes and KFC. You'll never return to those places once you try Canes. The Texas toast and special sauce is what really puts this place above the competition. I always go with a Caniac when I'm really hungry.. Awrsome as usual!  Waited longer for food inside than did waiting for table but once food came it was delish!. Cool barista willing to offer suggestions and then to make some very drinkable espresso concoctions.
The atmosphere here on a Saturday late evening was quite eclectic. 
This place is dog friendly, if you sit outside, and they even have a dog water bowl.
Definitely worth a repeat visit, especially as it is open later than most coffee shops.. I had the seafood kabob. It was very tasty salmon and shrimp. I also particularly liked the rice which had some little pasta throughout it. Good quality food - I recommend it.. Beautifully crafted food, passionate and friendly chefs and a cozy atmosphere make this one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal.  Each day you are treated to a new and interesting menu and you get to sit right in front of the chefs as they prepare your order.  Great experience and cuisine. I came to this place just because my friend wanted to check it out. He said he saw it on the food channel, so I was more inclined to go. When you first arrive, you'll see that it's a very small restaurant with two tables for outside seating and 4 tables inside. Don't let the griminess get to you, because it does appear run down and dirty. 

I ordered the Philly Subsandwich and it was delicious!!! Hefty portions too! I actually couldn't finish my food, but damn, I'll reiterate. IT WAS DELICIOUS!

If you don't mind that LA, NY grimy feel of a restaurant, I suggest checking this place out. You won't be disappointed.. Can't recommend enough. All too often auto shops are filled with sketchy people who take advantage of their customers.  Elevens has always treated me fairly with the highest quality product available.  They communicate well with project budgets and timelines.  Go check them out.. Chicken enchilada omelet.  The best omelet I've had in a long time.  Love the cherry coffee cake.. They have some unique Mexican dishes, and the food is always fresh, well prepared and comes out hot.  I wish they served chips and salsa with the meal,. but that doesn't stop me from going there.

The The Cuban sandwich is very nice, it's a bit of a twist on the traditional. Right now, this place is really the only Mexican joint downtown (unless you count Chipotle).. Prohibition speakeasy ambiance? Check.  Incredibly friendly, hip, knowledgeable, and helpful staff?  Check?  1920's hair, and outfits?  Check?  Interesting craft cocktails, and delicious reasonably priced food?  Check and check!  For an added treat, check out their tenderpgh website with a very fun retro stylized vibe.

I had a great experience at Tender and I'd go back in a heart beat.  My only criticisms are, the food menu while tasty is pretty limited with less than a dozen options at the time of my writing this.  The portions are pretty small (think tapas bar tastes) though they are prized accordingly with most dishes between $5-$8.  

I suspect Tender (Short for bartender) makes most of their money on the drinks, most are in the $10-$15 range, so 3 drinks will easily cost you over $40 with tip.  That's a bit rich for my blood, but I'm the first to admit these are not your everyday libations.  They use top shelf ingredients, and hand craft each drink fresh for you, including rare ingredients like rhubarb bitters, blood orange marmalade, and clove infused cucumbers.  They also support local PGH businesses with ingredients like Wigle Whiskey and Heinz Simply Ketchup, which as a long time burgher I love to see.

I'd go back for the nibbles, service, and atmosphere any day, but I'd save the craft drinks for a deserving occasion.  i.e. Taste on Tuesdays, but save the sipping for special Saturday celebrations!. Great coffee.  I might like this place because the weather is so good right now, but the coffee is great too.  I am an organic snob and these guys tend to have organic coffee for me as well.. Great white pizza.  The service was excellent. My wife ordered Bloody Mary with grey goose! It was perfect. 4.5 Stars:
The Basil Chicken as delicious and the #71 chicken ayam renda was even better! The Ayam chicken was cooked in a Red curry sauce that reminded me of an Indian curry and Thai Panang curry combination with less coconut milk. The sauce on the Ayam had a hint of sweet and just the right amount of Spicy. 

This is a really good find and I can't wait to try out the rest of the Menu.. Best choice in Ballantyne area!  Service is terrific, owner Charles very inviting, atmosphere up beat and very pleasant food is excellent. Love the music and the wine tasting events. Keep going!. Good Chinese food. General Taos chicken and the chicken and broccoli are done right. All plates come with fried rice and a egg roll. The meals are very cheap! Give them a try if your in the area. Live this place. Went with a friend that knows ken and we were treated love family. Awesome customer service. And the food was great too. Thanks Brooke. Great hotel in a great location. I had an amazing view of PNC Park and Heinz Field as well as of a part of Downtown. They have a great service and the valley parking is really quick, too.. This place has earned my business. Been coming here every time I go to Vegas and all my friends that I've introduced here also like it. The prices are listed in the other reviews. The ladies always work real hard n get the pain out from all the right places. I usually leave them a minimum of $10 as a tip.. I have never seen the real "Prince" in person but after seeing this show, it made me realize everything I've been missing. I really enjoyed myself and will definitely go see him again the next time I'm in Vegas.. I found the food to be very good and the selection of items to and sauces to be the perfect amount to choice from.
The area is a little small and can fill up fast during peak times and can be hard to get around at times.. The manager of the store was the person actually helping me and his knowledge of the line and of what the occasion I was shopping for needed (a Vegas show that night) was phenomenal. The dress I ended up with was gorgeous and perfect for the show. Thanks to the wonderful manager that took the time to help a neurotic woman find something special! (obviously this was Phil's wife writing the review:) ). It happened again!

Mike picked up my bike (filthy as it was) and gave it the "once over" for the season.  He went through it, found a small coolant leak and something with the carb boots (whatever those are) and tuned it up.

Called him to see how it was going and he told me he ws just getting it "dialed in"

He delivered it back to the house and it was cleaner than new, and actually runs better than it ever has.  I was seriously going to sell it and get something else, and now you will never get it away from me!

When he gave me my total, I was honestly concerned that he did not charge me enough.  Need to make sure he stays in business!

A truly honest mechanic.  Who would have guessed they existed?  He even has the coolest cellular credit card machine I have ever seen..  you sign with you finger right on his phone.

If you EVER need someone to work on your bike..  Mike is the guy!  Wish I could give him more than 5 stars.. Absolutely the best burger I've ever had. 

Duck bacon, egg and sharp cheddar cheese. Perfectly cooked. Moist and juicy. Next time, I think I'll add some mushrooms to it. 
The fries were also expertly cooked. They had that delicious crispy outside with a soft and chewy inside. Curry ketchup tastes like it sounds. In my opinion, the flavors didn't really go well. I can see the appeal but to me it was more of a gimmick. However, the chipotle ketchup superb. 

We also ordered the jalepeno poppers and the presentation was excellent. They were backed up with a solid taste. 

Honestly, unless you're a big guy, the burger is enough to fill you just fine. Everyone I saw was leaving their fries at the bar and at first I figured it was because they weren't that good. But in reality it was just because the burger was so dang good and filling. I recommend sharing some fries with a friend unless you're hankering for some food. 

I ordered the Jalepeno Margarita (I like it hot what do you want from me?!) and it was a typical 'rita. It wasn't bad but it didn't knock me on my ass like the burger did.  
My wife ordered the Green tea gin, now that was an original cocktail with a great taste. i was a huge fan. In fact we came back several hours later and ordered a couple of more for the road. 
They have a great selection of beer on tap. I was very impressed with what they had. 

We sat at the bar and the service was a bit slow, but it was well worth the wait. Seriously, it was the best burger in terms of meat that I've ever had. Now, I like a burger that's juicy and moist. And this was it. it almost melted in my mouth. If that's not your type of burger, then... you need to have your head evaluated :). We popped into this place to have a look see, what we found was an ultra exclusive very expensive hotel!  The hallways are kept really dark almost like walking through a temple.  Not much to see if your staying there as there is only a coffee shop and an exclusive restaraunt availble for publc eyes.. I like the Outback.  It may not have Ruth's Chris quality steaks but it also doesn't have Ruth's Chris prices.  The Outback has good tasting steaks (and pork, ribs, and fish) that most of us can afford.  Also the service is quite good as well.  So I recommend you go and enjoy!. I don't write many reviews on Yelp, but I have to give it up to Myriad Real Estate Group. Skyler has been amazing to work with and has exceeded my expectations.  He is extremely knowledgeable about all things real estate and he really does go above and beyond to make sure that everyone is comfortable and happy.  I can't say enough good things about the Myriad Real Estate team.  I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to buy or sell their home!. My co-workers and I hit this place quite a bit for lunch.  They have a buffet going and I always hate myself for getting that second helping of Kheer, but it's all so tastey.. Family and I went to McAlisters and it is just like the one's in Oklahoma. Very good food for ok prices. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Just don't forget to get some sweet tea!  

On this trip, I got the pick two. I got a cup of soup and a French dip sandwich. My wife got a the grilled chicken spud. Son got Mac and cheese kids meal. Food was hot and delivered very promptly after ordering. All tasted great. 

Pros:
Great food
Good fast service
Sweet tea (I mean c'mon, you have to put it on here!)

Cons:
Can be a bit pricey for a soup and sandwich.. Very fun morning riding! Our wrangler was very nice, the horses friendly and well taken care of. It was a fun morning to get away from Phoenix and enjoy being outside!. Great  customer service. Investigated other frame options for me also.my phone did not allow me to download Yelp, so I used Martins.. Great little secret find in the southside. I like this place much better than Nickys thai kitchen, which happens to be the gold standard in pittsburgh. The food is always deliscious, and the one time I did have a problem with the food not being spicy enough the owner was extremely helpful. He suggested that when I order I say that I want a 9 thai style because they make it american due to too many people complaining. The tofu red curry is my go to, and the spring rolls with peanut sauce are to die for! BYOB!!!. At first, I was a little skeptical if this place would as good as the original location as with most restaurants who scale. Well, it is....It is the same quality as the original. As usual, the Komex tacos were great along with the kimchi fried rice with three meats. The service is always friendly and attentive. Good job Komex!. I'm a guy. I used to pay $8 for hair cuts or get them for free from a friend. Most cuts probably made me look like Lloyd Christmas.
A few years ago I started to change the way I think about hair and started shelling out $25. I got a great cut and I kept going back.
Last year I got a recomendation to see Jason at Salon 42 and because the person I used to go to was booked solid for month, I went.

I pretty much told Jason that he came highly recomended so do whatever and if it sucked, my hair would grow back and I just wouldn't come back. However, Jason still took the challenge. He did an incredible job and I got more compliments than ever on my hair (something I never really pay attention to on other guys) from both men and women. One problem I have with my hair is that as it gets longer, it begins to curl at the edges. Also, while I have a full head of hair, the back grows more rapidly than the top and front (probably due to all that East TN water I used to drink). Whatever Jason does, he gives me a great cut the day of, but it now seems to grow much more even so now my entire head can have a party or be combed for business at the same time. I can choose!

I have continued to go back every few months when the hair gets too shaggy and Jason not only remembers who I am but remembers what we last talked about. It makes it easy to have conversation and catch up while getting a top notch haircut.

You can tell this is not a job for Jason but an actual passion. He and his wife have been opening up other locations recently and it is easy to see why they are so successful.
I've heard girls get a great style and cut there but speaking as a guy, I highly recomend it for men's cuts.. Everything is fresh ... Wasn't a fan of their cold ciabatta sandwich bread . Maybe next time I'll try a panini.. Norma is a great barber. I followed her over to her new location.. Seriously fantastic food and service! If you are a foodie- you must try this place. Citrus salad, crane Assad...too good!!!!. Second time ordering. First time had sweet and shrimp and the vegetables and chicken. Veg needed some slice. This time had sweet and sour check cken and the orange chicken both are good. Three out four so far been good.. Great burgers, excellent service and a shovelful of fries...all at a great price. 

What's not to love?. Just back from a great evening at Osaka, celebrating my 75 BDAY.
4 of us upon leaving commented, " what a great fun evening "
Definitely will go back. One of the original restaurants along Gilbert Rd.  Always have quick service and great food when we go there.  The bread and pizza dough is insane!. Sorry, can't give it 5 stars because I'm from NY. That's not snobbery talking, it's just fact. NYC has the best "NYC Style" pizza.

That said, I acknowledge only 4 pizzerias in the country that are worthy of the "NYC Style" moniker. Pucci's in South Beach, Miami... Cazzola's in Coral Gables, Miami, Pin Up Pizza in Las Vegas and this. It's fun just trying to find this place. You'll know what i mean when you go there. It's open 

That's it. No reason to eat pizza anywhere else. ESPECIALLY CHICAGO!. The Cage is the most vibrant bar in Squirrel Hill, with the possible new exception of the Independent Brewing Co., but the two don't really overlap in purpose or atmosphere. It's a smoking dive with patient and friendly staff and a wild mix of customers. You might wait a while for service at busy points--it's not a heavily staffed place and the drinks and food are cheap. 

Billy the bartender is a staple of the establishment and is well known for his jolly attitude, willingness to light up your smoke, and friendly and generous patronage of local businesses. The old guard of serving staff have always been on top of things even while the bar was busy, and the new staff seems to be merging quite well into the mix. Kudos. 

The Cage has always seemed like a sort of social equalizer to me. The patrons all talk to one another and congregate loosely, and it's a good place for casual conversations among friends or whoever is around. Even if you're not a regular, you'll likely see someone you know every time you stop by. 

Non-smokers who can't stand smoke--don't bother. Otherwise, it's a really damn cool place. Give it a shot.. Excellent sushi at a fair price. Sakana is a nice clean place with very helpful staff. There are always interesting special rolls and such that are on display as you walk in, but are sometimes not on the menu.  It's worth walking back to take a look again before ordering.

Some of the non-sushi food is quite good as well. Great salads.. Simply wow...u won't find better indian food in a fine dining luxury place. This food court joint exceeded expectation with quality, quantity, authentic flavours, n best of all fresh hot food on the vegas strip.. Great place  for coffee with a lot of ppl.. The coffee was delicious but the music was noisy... Heard about this place from my friends on Yelp! Of course. Thought that we'd give it a try since we tend to eat more of the flexitarian/vegetarian variety these days. 

A little hard to find (across South Blvd from Chipotle and next to Icehouse) but once we found it, it was awesome. 

Comfortable setting, warm greeting from our server and tons of warm bodies behind the make line busting and prepping. 

Tons of fresh fruit and veggies stacked on old bookshelves, freshly baked cookies cooling out in the dining area and a wonderfully high ceiling for a nice open dining space. 

Here's a tip: GET A JUICE. They are fantastic. So fresh and packed with nutrients. The El Diablito was our choice. Carrot, apple and orange. It was delightful. 

Breakfast was so bright and full of flavors. The Muesli is quite citrusy and spiced well with nutmeg. Tons of fresh fruit. All good. Our server told us that they make their own almond milk and coconut. Fascinating. 

The parfait was the best part of breakfast. My wife and I were both impressed. the coconut yogurt was delicious and had a nice touch of vanilla. 

Friendly, attentive staff, cozy and unique. What a great local business to check out in South End!

Can't wait to head back for lunch and try the Lunasagna! Thanks, Luna's!. The pho here is really good.  Better than most places.  The staff is nice and pretty attentive.  The Ox Tail Pho is awesome!!  When I need more sprouts or green onions, they bring it with no problem.. The wife and I had the endless appetizer deal they have going on at TGI Friday's.  All the appetizers were good, except for one and our server made our experience really well.  Prices are what to be expected at a place like TGI Friday's so that was nice.  Overall, it's a nice place to eat at if you're shopping at Norterra.. Great place for free wi-fi and mellow ambiance.  Crepes were good too.  The coffee was good, but they gave me a huge latte when I order a cappuccino.  It is surprising how common this is throughout the valley.  Coffee snobs who know what coffee should be like, might prefer Seattle Espresso down the street.

As far as ambiance, Cupz n Crepes wins.  Usually the Eiffel Tower motif seems too trite, but I didn't mind it so much here.  The spread here offered warmth of a woman's touch too.  Although it was far from old-timey, it seemed like a smiling grandmother might come out of the kitchen door with an apron and the smell of fresh apple pie.. Cool place. Very busy, get their early.  Still looking for my favorite pasty. Got the chocolate bread desert, it was GREAT! Will go their again!. Rice Paper, a sister location, has it down. We are aware that both venues are owned by the same owner but this one need a little discipline. The spring rolls we loosely wrapped, filled with to much lettuce and the sause was good but runny. We will be back cause we live close but for now we will go back to 7th street for our fix.
Gave them another chance last night. Much better! So I added a star.. At last!  A real butcher shop.  The people are as authentic as is the operation and offerings.

You can get anything that has two or four legs.  On the wall is a chart with all the things you can get by category.  Just ask for what you want and they will have it the next day.

We gave a trial with their smoked bacon, the only bacon they have and it is thick cut, lightly smoked and clean tasting.  You don't pick up the salty chemical taste common in the super market bacons.

And their Italian sausage is outstanding.  The hot WAS HOT!  We orders both the mild and hot for stuffed bell peppers prepared both and ended up mixing up both and still the hot came through.  Very flavorful.

They were accommodating over 350 turkey orders for Thanksgiving customers, so it was clear that the word is out.  And if you doubt that, look at the wall behind the counter and take in the mosaic of orders posted there.

Will be ordering a favorite of mine, ox tails, which will be fresh and not looking yucky in a vacuum sealed bag like at the super market.

These guys are the real thing and althought prices are a bit higher than a market, you know it is fresh and you can get the cuts you want the way you want them cut.. I was there last night, and tried their Ribeye Steak and Mashed Potatoes (Yes, they were real!).  Very reasonably priced ($14.99), and delicious.  The kids had hamburgers.  They were HUGE!  1/2 pound burgers.  All in all you really get alot of food for your money.. Great food and great service.  Will tell others to try them.. Highly personalized customer service. No pressure just pure customer service. And the product is highly recommended.. Very nice pieces, especially at 50% off. If you are looking for southwest inspired jewelry, rugs, art, etc, this is the place to go.. Great spot!  We sat on the back patio, and even though some dbag was smoking a cigar (seriously, that should be illegal) we had a great meal and a great time.  The small plates were fantastic - avocado fries being a highlight for us.  Some bits were better than others, but everything was tasty.  Excellent addition to Plaza Midwood and hopefully can pick up some of the slack as Soul has been inconsistent lately.. Seriously a tasty crepe can be had here. Ordered the Papa K savory crepe and it was delicious. Also picked up the chocolate chip cookie (theoretically given the size it was practically 2 cookies). It was flaky and oh so chocolaty. 

Service was excellent and the waiters/waitresses were super nice. The only downside is given that this place is so popular, expect a wait for your food. My only suggestion is try and beat the rush, your stomach will thank you.. I've been coming here for 6 years now and they are the best!  Excellent customer service and zero pressure when purchasing tires.  I highly recommend this company and location.. Visited for a date night evening.  Original plan was to go to Firebird.  However, Firebird had a two hour wait.  So we decided to venture to Cantina 1511.  We were pleasantly surprised that we could be seated within 30 minutes.  The atmosphere was inviting and the wait staff was delightful.  I ordered fish tacos and my wife ordered quesadillas.  The nacho chips were freshly made and seasoned to perfection.  I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone and we intend to visit again very soon.. Great spot for always unique coffee (and more traditional options too).  On Sunday they had locals there selling their jewelry, knitting, etc.  I got a delicious chai latte. During the summer when they have a farmers market on Saturdays.. I probably say, that I may not be the #1 Fan, but sure enough I am a fan of the Blue Man Group. In between 1999 - 2010, I probably seen them 5 times. The last two times was about 2 years apart, in which, the last visit, wasn't as exciting as the previous. Since majority of it was the same thing. 

But, got to give credit where credit is due. It is an amazing show, and I probably would see it again, after they make a new album. I do have majority of their albums as well as a DVD of one of their shows. Now, I'm not sure why I come back, or why I find them interesting. It may be the unique sound they have, or the way they can make music out of pipes or other things that you may not expect. But over all, I say that their uniqueness of the show and style of music is what attracts me to come back to watch this show. 

The kind of music they play can be adapted to any genre or music. But most likely, its a diverse sound with drumming and alternative/rock sound. It also has some comedy mixed into it, but sure enough, seeing people in blue is funny as is, or at least just looking at them will make you think...WTF. Mainly that's how their show is, it will make you think....WTF, in a fun way. 

Of course, I love their music, I love their show, and sure enough I will see them again. Now, if you guys are looking for something different and unique, other then that usual Magic shows, or acrobatic shows out their. This is something I would recommend to go see.. Excellente cuisine.  Très belle présentation des assiettes et portions généreuse. Porc au caramel de gingembre succulent ainsi que la chaudré.. It's been a long time since I had some excellent Romali Roti love their fish Dishes as well not too spicy not to mild.  Very polite and professional people working at this place and very good with delivery.  Definately has become my new regular place.. Stopped by on Saturday while they were finishing the build-out and offering a few people the chance to see the space, some of the goods, and the process.  Particularly like the open window where you can watch the bakers at work and the passion they seem to be putting into making this space more than just another strip knockoff of a famous place from elsewhere.  While pastries were unfortunately not available to the public during my walkthrough, Buddy was around teaching the team and coaching them on aspects of not only baking, but customer satisfaction in a very hands on way that I found impressive for a 'celebrity chef.'  More impressed than I'd have ever guessed by Buddy V's I'm looking forward to heading back here this weekend for a comprehensive tasting, particularly as the prices don't appear to have suffered the famous strip up-charge, instead harkening the original at Hoboken.. The restaurant is beautiful with great ambiance! The wait staff are some of the best in the country!  The food is incredible!  My God, what more could you ask for? I will return over and over again every time I visit Las Vegas.  I think you should too!. I will keep this short and sweet, as there are already many extensive and excellent reviews on the seven "Buffet of Buffets" ...buffets.

I took advantage of the Buffet of Buffets deal when I was in Vegas in April 2010. I never knew how awesome this deal was until my last Vegas trip (May 2011), where I dropped $121 for two at The Buffet at Wynn ($46/ea "Holiday Pricing" on a Post Office holiday BS + we had the so-called "unlimited" champagne for an additional $10/ea, but with the slow refills, it wasn't truly "unlimited").

Vegas has mastered the art of the buffet. None of the three buffets we tried were bad, though some were better than others.

My group of friends tried the following buffets (in order of favorite to least liked):
1. Spice Market Buffet @ Planet Hollywood - great selection and overall quality of food (dinner) - I'd say quality of food was close to that of The Buffet at Wynn
2. Lago Buffet @ Ceasar's Palace - went here for a fantastic breakfast.. great service and drinks are quickly served
3. Flavors Buffet @ Harrah's - lunch - worst of the three, but not horrible. Ambiance was underwhelming, but they do have a chocolate fountain where I was able to dip my Rice Krispy Treats in.

Overall a great deal. Although I remember it being cheaper in early 2010, you still can't beat the price at under $50 for 3+ meals. It sounds like we missed out on the Paris buffet, but I'll make a point to check it out if I do BoB again.

Only downside to the Buffet of Buffets deal is that you have to continue to wear the wristband the whole time you do it (so when you sleep, shower, go to the pool, etc.. it will be in your pictures lol).. Great breakfast.  We hit it early on Sunday morning right as they opened.  Great selection.  I had the Bruce's Bowl and my wife had the chocolate chip waffles.  Both were very good. The Bruce's Bowl came with a side of pancakes that was too much.  I sample them, good, but didn't put a dent in the stack.  Loved the squirt bottle for syrup.  Less mess.  Side of bacon was also two thumbs up!. One word-OUTSTANDING! Kristin came to our home, set up her massage table, and gave massages to my wife and 2 teenage boys. Great experience and very relaxing for the whole family! When I asked one of my sons how he liked his first ever  massage, his response was, "That's what I want for my next birthday!" Thank you, Kristin, we HIGHLY recommend you and your super massage services!. You can't go wrong with whatever you pick. We've had 4/6 sandwiches and they've all been great. Definitely worth a trip.. Yeah, this place is awesome. They're slinging fabulous grilled chicken with warm corn tortillas, thick, crispy, freshly fried tortilla chips, and super tasty pinto beans. I think this place will likely supplant El Pollo Supremo as my go-to joint except when I want beef as well.

The menu is very limited including chicken and a burger and that's it, but they are doing what most restaurants haven't figured out, that they shouldn't try to be all things to all diners, they just do the thing that they do better than the guy down the street does it.

Stick it, Colonel, this is finger lickin' good.. The Service is nothing short of spectacular. The host not only wants to feed you out of the goodness of his heart, they actually care a lot about how much people like their food. My gf has issues with hot food but the host was so nice, offered her remake her food but didn't have to because it came out perfect just like she had ordered. The food is so amazing, this will be my regular go to Indian place. I grew up in Chandigarh so I am from Punjab but this place makes better Punjabi food then most places out there. Only one thing they are vegetarian. Another thing I love about these guys. Polite, excellent food, very hospitable, just simply amazing. 
Foods to try: Gobi Manchurian, Any DOSA, vegetable biryani, so and the desserts OMG it making me hungry just thinking about it.. Best place in MGM. Great service, great food. Highly recommend the flat iron steak, sub out the fries for the potatoes. The pizza is great, not average, it's wood-fired nicely with very flavorful quality toppings. For a nice meal in the MGM, hit this. We want to go back to try the Chocolate soufflé.. I like the menu at point Brugge better but this is nice for a change of scenery.

I was luck to get a table outside. 

Service here is always great. Fast and friendly. 

We had some great drinks while waiting for some appetizers. Our group shared the mussels as this is their staple!!! 

Can't wait to go back again.. Try the chicken tamales and burritos they are great.  Everything is made fresh.... hidden gem!. When I first moved to Edinburgh, the word around the first year students was that The Peartree House was the best bar in the city.

It wasnt until I was lucky enough to live opposite it a few years later that I really began to understand how true this statement was. Firstly, the beer garden is amazing - its huge, and being so close to the university, on the rare days where the sun comes out, you will be gauranteed to find the garden full of people enjoying the sun and just generally having a great time. 

In fact, that pretty much describes any day at The Peartree House. The pub itself is small, cosy and warm - the bar is in the centre, with squishy seats around it and tables and chairs in odd little nooks and crannies. 

The Peartree House really is one of the best places in Edinburgh, but truthfully its really expensive, and would cost a hell of a lot to drink there as a regular.. We went here just for after dinner drinks and desert. Even though we didn't have dinner we still would recommend Flemmings. Facili thy is well appointed, upscale and inviting. It was a bit noise but noyhing that would deter my coming back. The patrons seemed to be professional and we'll dressed. The dessert we had was the cheese cake and it was delicious. We will try to make it back here for dinner and I will edit my review.. I took my 7 year old daughter to a "new dentist" for cavities that need to be filled. She dreaded going, she hates the shots!!  After signing her in I patiently waited in the lobby.  She walks out with a half smile, since she was numb, and said "ok mom I'm ready to go".  Wow...no crying, no holding her hand, no protesting the entire process! This is a first :)  When I woke up the next morning there is a note pushed under my door that said "Mom, I love my new dentist! Can we go back there from now on?"  

That was 6 years ago...we will never change to another dentist! Dr. Po is experienced, patient, encouraging and calming with our entire family.  In addition, his prices are more competitive than I ever found in the Las Vegas valley.

I promise once you meet him and the staff, you will always be in excellent hands!. Had to find a new groomer after a DISASTROUS experience at Bow Wows and am thrilled with these guys. Great cut for little Chewy, and he was happy when we left, kissing everyone and saying good by to all of them. Such a relief after the last clown got her hands on him.

I highly recommend and encourage you to bring your little ones!. I was pleased as soon as I entered the theater. The pre-show tunes would please the crankiest and oldest of Prince People. And I would know! Alexander O'Neal, Jesse Johnson, Andre Cymone . Really...the extended version of 'Innocent'?! Damn!! I am pretty sure that I felt my hair get longer on one side while I awaited the show. It was so good that my cousins would have approved unanimously. I almost jumped up and did The Oak Tree!
The band is tight and the Prince guy is fun. He has the 'tude necessary to pull it off. He even dealt nicely with the loud chick from Compton that tried to steal the show from the audience. They had a segment of the show where they did some requests, which was fun. I didn't get '17 Days', but they did 'Housequake' and 'Adore.'
I highly recommend it, and feel tht they deserve better promotion and a nicer room.
Cheap domestics and wells at Hooters. Be sure to tip your waitress.. I enjoyed myself here, but it's not a place you want to spend the entire night. It's better to stop by here as part of your Vegas crawl. Their exotic drinks were good, and the band was all right. This is a bit of a place for an older crowd. This one was a lot better than the one in Myrtle Beach for sure.. Always very good and very consistent. Appetizers and entrees and pizzas are very good !!. Best airport coffee place ever! Great people, it's like a real coffee house. They really care about the coffee and the experience. I think they should charge more. Most places would charge double for much less.. Great facility. Easy parking. Enough food. Love this facility for NBA and CIAA events.. Now, I have seen Bourdain eat here, I've read up on the joint from various food blogs and on-line culinary magazines, but other than remembering to order from the Northern Thai section of the menu all other specific knowledge went out the window because I was so god damn drunk! Apparently, I am told, I couldn't even recall where the bathroom was despite the fact I had just relieved myself there only fifteen minutes prior.

F*cking Slot Waitresses. F.S.W.

But I did remember to take pictures dear readers and I can say everything we ordered was not only downright delectable but tasted just as good, if not better, than anything that I ate in the four weeks I spent in Thailand.

Yes. I said it. And I stand by it with my FlavorBoner held high.


Nam Prik Ong (Red Chili Dip w/ ground pork) intended to be a starter to your meal, is not too spicy and has just the right amount of sweet from the ground pork. It is awesome with the crudités and chicharones served with it. The cool from the vegetables and the heat from the dip work really well together, even for a drunk ass like myself.

Hey. It was a long drive, all right, and I was on a mission. So... whatever.


Nam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice) The center of the rice was perfectly moist and soft and the outside was sensationally crunchy. How they did that I have no idea. There was an overall wonderful ginger/lime flavor going on in this dish with flame coming from the green onion and fresh chilies.  Yum!


Sai Oua (Northern Style Sausage) Fresh, house made, Thai spicy pork sausage. Enough said. Either you get it or you don't. No need to sell it.

"A guy don't walk on the lot lest he wants to buy!"

-- Alec Baldwin, Glengarry Glen Ross

Garlic Prawn. Deep fried in their shell, this dish has a potato chip crunch to it and it's so frickin' garlicky. And I mean that in the best possible way. This is a not to be missed dish for those of you who do not dig anything with hoofs.

Then there was our little crispy drunken Daffy, the Crispy Duck Drunken Noodle. The skin on the bird was indeed crispy and salty. Her meat tender and juicy. The vegetables were cooked yet firm and the bird-based broth that the slippery, wide noodles bathed in was the perfect compliment to the other spicy dishes as it smoothed everything out.

Now not all of the dishes we ordered were from the Northern Thai portion of the menu that everyone recommended, some were chef's choices others, like the drunken noodle, were personal favorites.

Just order what you want. It's your meal. Everything here will be good. You are not going to go wrong.. I love this place, the breakfast burros are the best I have ever had.   For lunch, there is a broad selection which should please everyone in the group.  My kids always want to stop here when we drive to Phoenix or San Diego, it is always worth a stop.  The cookies are awesome too1. We stumbled in here in need of nourishment after an afternoon of bar hopping on a game Saturday.  Busy, but still really quick to get food, drinks and a seat at the bar.  It was some sort of Saturday special on Miller Lite and plenty of TVs for football.. Good stuff! Seems to be relatively healthy. Great snack  before or after the gym. 4 stars because of inconsistency in the bowls. Ex. Sometimes you get honey, sometimes you don't.. I've had an old garage door on my house for about 20+ years, and worked just great. We did a garage remodel and had to move the door, re-installed it later on, and soon after the motor on our opener stopped working. I called Always Open and they came out and told me I could really benefit from some new teflon rollers, and boy were they right! If you have steel rollers these new ones make quite a difference, my garage is now whisper quiet! It even seems like it rolls much better and smoother. As for the garage door opener, they sold me on some newer technology. I am using a lift master opener with their built in wifi box, so now I can control my garage door opening and closing from lift masters app on my iPhone. Super convenient and very handy when friends or family need something from my house, but I'm not home to let them in. They charged a fair price, other companies seemed to charge around the same amount, but I ultimately decided to choose Always Open because they are a smaller family run company, and from experience, family owned companies seem to "care" more about the product and services they offer. These guys did an awesome job repairing my 20+ year garage door and literally made it BETTER than most garage doors I see on new homes today. 

I am writing this review now after a year of testing their installation and products, and everything is still working like it was the day after they repaired it! A nice feature my lift master has that I didn't know it had is a battery backup, my power went out, and to my surprise I was able to open and close my garage door! I highly recommend Always Open for your garage door services, and I will be calling them again in 19 years! Hopefully I can squeeze another 20 years of service into this old garage door.. My favorite local location. Good service, always clean. Lines can get long a dinner time but it moves fast. The food is what it is. If you don't know you should stop reading this and start ordering. It's the shit. This place is amazing the food is delicious and well presented, I had the sushi lunch special. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would easily recommend this place to anyone looking for good sushi in Las Vegas. I see myself eating here often.. Earl of sandwich is great for grabbing a quick bite to eat. The line is long not because the service is slow but because the sandwiches are that good. Also u can always call ahead so take it to go!
Keep it going earl staff!!!!. one of the new clubs in vegas which is nice. the wait took forever since we didnt get a table the night we went. paid the security just to pass the line and had to pay to get in. which sucked btw. the decor is so-so. pretty tight compared to the other club but the view of the waterfall is gorgeous. tables looked small but i cant write a whole review since we came here on one of our last night and we were really burnt from the non stop partying and gambling without rest. till next time!. As always a great meal. This is my wife and my 5th visit at this restaurant and always pleased.. Ok, so the management team was very concerned about my disappointment based on my 1st visit and resulting poor Yelp review.  They were very responsive and very proactive in finding out exactly what did not go well - I give them 4 stars for customer service.  They sent me a gift certificate and I'll be sure to go back and give them another shot. I'm looking forward to a return visit.. My wife and I had lunch here for the first time. We found the service and food much above average. Price was very reasonable and presentation was very excellent. We plan to take a group of friends there soon.. Local Motors is true Americana wrapped up in the shape of the coolest car on the road.  Bring the kids on a weekend to see the future of American manufacturing, and the entrepreneurial spirit of the place will put a smile on your face.. Margaritaville is what it is, a place to have fun and have some drinks. If you take it for more than that, you'll be disappointed. When I've gone to any Margaritvaville, it's for some drinks and some appetizers.

Prior to the hockey game, my friends and I stopped in for a drink or two. We also ordered the big stack of nachos with all the toppings. The nachos were great and hit the spot.  We probably could have devoured another order.

I ordered a hurricane. The drink was good, but hardly as good as the hurricanes I've had in the past here. Service was very good.. I always come back to Elmer's Tacos. It's easily the best Mexican (although being from Dallas, I'd call it more Tex-Mex) I've had in Arizona. The food is delicious, and adding that two people can eat well for under $20, the price is perfect.. I love this place because with everyone I talked to, they were like "Oh yeah, you gotta go there!" or "No way, echhhh! It's not worth it at all!"

Polarizing. That is the stuff I want. And I loved the sandwich; A heap of meat, covered with damn good fries and a dry, vinegary cole slaw inside soft, thick slices of bread. The formula is seen in other places around the country, and is even what brought about the hamburger itself: the working man wanted it all in a portable pouch that wouldn't get their hands too dirty. Come to Binghamton for spiedies or Jersey for a ripper, potatoes and peppers in a b read pocket. There are others around the country - all regional and either adored or misunderstood by locals. 

Yes, I would say this is a must-visit in Pittsburgh. And because there are so many around the city, you probably won't have to make a special visit to experience it.. This place is family run and a great place to tan.  The reviewer that said the place is creepy is clearly an idiot.  The guys and gals at the front desk are extremely friendly (as long as you're not a creeper trying to run in and out as fast as you can).  I would suggest this place to anyone.  Just a heads up if you like the stand ups, there is only 1, but it gets the job done.  Thanks Alternative Tan!!!. This place is very similiar to The Counter as you can build your own custom burger.  In some sense it is better in that you can choose the type of beef (I got Kobe but more on that later), but there is slightly less choices on the other toppings (though still a lot compared to most other places). I really enjoyed the place, nice american bar-y atmosphere but not too crowded, and a short wait for lunch. Moroever the burger did not ge me overstuffed, which is a bonus as I hate wasting quality food and don't like to pack stuff to go. 

This time around I got the Kobe patty with American and Chedder cheese, plus bacon, grilled onions, and truffles all topped with an onion bun. For sides I got the sweet potato fries, also ate normal fries, but regardless they were nothing to rave about. As for the Kobe patty, well you can't really beat Kobe (WARNING: it is American Kobe not real Japanese Kobe) when it comes to beef do undoubtly it was good. But really I think it is a waste to put such prime meat into a burger. Don't get me wrong if McDonalds served it for cheap I would get it all the time but for 20 bucks mmmmmmhhhh iono.

Definitely a chill place that I would visit again even if it was just to grab a beer and a burger. Next time I think I will be trying the beer floats.. I travel to Chandler once a month for a week.  I have been doing this for 3 years now.  Every time I arrive,  I come here.  

Their Jamison wings are off the chart.

Their custom service is outstanding.

Their beer selection is by far the best.

Most importantly,  they WANT you to come back and, when you do, you feel it.

Great place! Great staff!  Great times!!. What a great value! Charlie's cheesesteak deli serves a pretty wide variety of sandwiches, but let's be honest...the cheesesteaks are the real reason to come here! $6.99 gets you a cheesesteak with fries (drink is extra) and you better be hungry because the portions here are really generous. If one wasn't really hungry, the meal really could be split between two people. Oh and don't forget to present your player's card for a 10% discount! This locals casino may be a tad rough around the edges but with restaurant values this good, I'll definitely be coming back.. Have been here innumberable times:  Consistently high quality product, service, and reasonable prices.  The place is always very clean, and  they don't mind me lounging with a magazine or the Trib long after I've finished.  Price is reasonable, and the meat quality is the best in town.  Li'l Porgy's may slightly have an edge if you like sweet sauce, but I am a fan of HR.  Great place!. Tried the scallops and the famous lobster poutine. The scallops was "so so" but my wife liked it. However I would definitely come back for the poutine. It's way better than any poutine at La Banquise. This guy takes poutine to another level!. I loved this little gem of a place! I was searching for good Greek food but nothing to fancy sitdown,and I was having a serious Gyro and Baklava craving.. so I was cruising around trying to find a place to eat near my hotel. 

Needless to say, it was great. It was quaint, quiet, small and the owner was very nice and asked if I had any questions over the menu.
When I entered the place was empty, and were greeted right away and asked if we had been there before. 


I got one Gyro wrap combos, an extra Gyro and Baklava which was really good.  The wraps were great, falafel with lettuce, tomato, onion, at tzaziki sauce.
Combo came with  fries and drink.  

My order was To-Go and was fast, food was hot and good balance of flavors.. Love it.

Dizzy's is a fantastic dive bar up on 7th St that is well worth the drive. They serve cheap beer, have cool clientele and you can order a Totino's frozen pizza for $3 if you're hungry late at night.. If you need service, talk to Amber the Asst. Service Manager... stopped by in the am to see if I could get some remotes programmed. She had me come back in the late afternoon and got me in, even though they were busy. Got to love the quick attention, even when it's not required! I'll be back!!. I thoroughly enjoyed this show from beginning to end.  No other stage setup in the world like this one and the performers use every inch of it.  It is pretty different from other Cirque shows w/ the biggest thing for me being that there were no edge of your seat omg they might die kinda thing.  This was more of just a great artistic vision of the Beatles songs which was just fine by me.  

We did the $100 balcony seats based on a lot of recs from Yelpers and I was glad we did cuz of that one scene.... The Beatles Love show is the best show I've seen in Vegas. Just came back from a wedding in Vegas and we had an extra night so we went and saw it again. Such a great show with everything you would want in a Vegas show. Acrobatics, light shows, crowd interaction, comedy, drama, and the best music you could set it to. It's the Beatles. See this show, you won't regret it.. Good place seems a little pricey at first but they give you a good sized portion, enough for two people to share one item ,their salsa verde is great and horchata is amaZing. Home away from home. This place offers you the tastes of the west Indies while paying a decent amount. I highly recommend the jerk chicken and goat roti. Both are mouthwatering and takes me back to how my grandmother cooked. 

The service has improved over the years. I know the place had its issues with a rude staff but they're now more family oriented now and look to please. Even the Jamaican patties are unique and makes a nice light snack. Don't  forget to try the ginger beer, it will go down well with the plate.. Nice spot for anyone from 2 to 100.....good variety, family friendly.  My personal favorites are the Wisconsin Mac'n'Cheese and the Pesto Cavatappi.. This guy is great! Made delicious BBQ, which as a Texan is saying a lot. His ribs and brisket were incredible, but I recommend smoking a whole pig. That's what we did, it was tasty- and Napoleon is a super nice guy, had beer with us while everything was cooking. I cannot recommend him enough.. Great little pub in downtown Charlotte. We were pleasantly surprised by Snooze. So many breakfast places in the Valley are, for lack of a better work, underwhelming. I don't need a lumberjack slam or an eight page menu of just breakfast offerings. Just do what you do and do it well - and that describes our experiences at Snooze. Excellent service, good coffee (BIG CUPS - if you are reading this, Snooze, we always have to ask for extra creamer for our two coffees), and good food. The interior is cool and comfortable. I'm glad we tried the place and, if you are considering giving Snooze a go, I think you will too.. Kabobs trio Rocks!. Hands down, the best tailor in town (and I've been to many).  Are they the cheapest?  No...but if you enjoy quality, Zizzo is the place to go.  The best part, if you want something altered ever further, there is no fuss about it, they just do it.  My dress shirts and sport coats fit me like they were custom made.  I will never go anywhere else.... Blondie's catered our unique back yard wedding and we couldn't be happier with our choice!  The food was unbelievable and a high light for all of our guests.  I highly recommend this awesome food truck!. This place quickly became my fav neighborhood restaurant and bar. They have a great selection of craft beers!

The food is unique and very tasty.  The burgers are big and the fries are seasoned  nicely.

The service is very fast and friendly.  The decor I love: very industrial with cool local art and wood accent walls. 

If you want a cool restaurant and bar you gotta check out the pig!. Joe's restaurants are always interesting to review because they have so many facets.

Food - A wide range of food that is both tasty and fresh, I have yet to go with someone who couldn't find something they liked on the menu. Personal favorites are the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Sweet Potato Fries. I also like their milkshakes, though they tend to be more tasty calories than I should be packing these days. Most of the veggies and food comes from the nearby farm.

Restaurant - Retro furturistic farmstead? I don't know where Joe gets his concepts, but they are fun. The building is the old Johnston family house, and the fireplace in the inside dining area still looks like it is from the 1950s. Also, be sure to visit the restrooms.

Outside Area - My one downside to this restaurant is the free for all often found around the building. The grass area is a great place for kids, but too many parents seem to think this is a license to let their kids run around unsupervised. I usually opt to eat inside as a result, which is a shame because it is such a beautiful area. 

Overall an honest recommendation for Joe's Farm Grill, one of the tastiest places around!. I stopped by here this past Tuesday evening with my wife and a friend for dinner.  We arrived shortly after 7 PM to find this place absolutely packed.  That meant that there wasn't any good parking spots available and so we had to park halfway up Capital Ave which if you don't know is a very steep cobblestone road.  The good news for us upon entering is that we were able to snag a table which was great as it seemed like people were waiting for tables the whole time that we were there.  The inside of Fiori's is somewhat small and I think they have 4 booths and 3 tables for seating as well as a pinball machine in one of the corners.

On this night our party decided to be simple and we ordered two large cheese pizzas for our table.  After taking a seat we probably waited around 20 minutes or so before our pizzas were ready for us.  The pizza ended up being pretty good and I can see why people in the South Hills always rave about Fioris.  My favorite part of it ended up being the crust which I thought had a really good crisp and a somewhat sweet flavor to it.  The cheese was also really good and there was a ton of it. Last but not least was the sauce whose flavor seemed to get lost with the cheese and crust.  So overall it was a pretty good pizza with my only complaint being that I could not for the life of me get the cheese to stay on the pizza while I was eating it.  Every time I took a bite or tried to cut it all of the cheese seemed to come off the rest of the slice.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I really enjoyed both the sweetness and crispiness of the crust and thought that there cheese was good as well.  Now if they can only do something about the parking situation outside.. Well done diner food.  Deluca's is pretty good for a greasy spoon.

The line moves surprisingly fast outside, so don't be daunted by a wait.  And once inside, staff is quick and friendly.

We had breakfast: traditional eggs, biscuits, meats, potatoes - all were very good.   The breakfast burritos are pretty big, too; best to share.  All the breakfast meats (sausages, bacon, and chiorzo) were fresh and flavorful.. Had a really great time at FnB last night.  The early summer menu was truly memorable.

Appetizers:

- The beets were full of flavor and the special creme freche like sauce really made them pop
- The braised leeks with the fried egg were incredibly good.  
- The lamb appetizer had mixed reviews.  I didn't think it was special, but two in our party really enjoyed them.

Mains:

- The lamb, artichoke moussaka was full of flavor.  I was fortunate enough to have the last serving. 
- The lamb chops are either the best or second best (see braised leeks) item on the menu.  So many flavors that tumble over.  Really enjoyed it.
- The sea bass was sea bass.  It was a little more grilled than usual, which gave it a nice flavor, but nothing to write home about
- My wife and friend loved the seafood pasta, but I can't comment too much, as I did not partake

Desserts: 

- The cornbread.  Well, I didn't have it, but the three in my party that did all loved it
- The Eton Mess was amazing.  Instead of strawberries, they used rhubarb.  The tartness of the rhubarb went perfectly with the meringue and cream.  I wish I had some right now for breakfast.

Service:

- Excellent.  Very helpful.  Very friendly.  Great timing.  Except for the end (see below).

FnB would have gotten five stars and still can in the future, but one thing really irked me.  We were rushed out.  The check came while we were still having dessert.  Ok, no problem, but usually you ask for the check.  Then after we had finished dessert and two in our party were still drinking their coffees, our server came and told us that there was no rush but that people were waiting for our table.  Ok, so that's a little off putting.  Two minutes later, the hostess came over and told us the same thing.  Ok, we got the point.  We'd only been there for 2.5 hours and the coffees were still half full.  Not a great ending, but I'll chalk it up as a mulligan and hope it doesn't happen again because the rest of the evening was excellent.

Oh, and they need more comfortable chairs.. they often good deals here on a few things we use regularly. this is a good once every 3-4 months shopping place. Top Shabu Shabu is an amazing Mongolian Hot Pot place. Hot Pot is basically Chinese Fondue-- you get a big pot of broth and dip veggies, noodles, and meats inside. Not only does Top Shabu Shabu make super authentic and delicious food but the lounge makes for a cool and unique dining experience. 

After studying in Hong Kong for a semester, I am no longer satisfied with Lo Mein or General Tso's chicken. For traditional asian cuisine and an exciting dining experience--Top Shabu Shabu is a no brainer.

Also staff is really great at giving tips and explaining the whole Hot Pot process. They understand this concept is foreign to many Americans and are super helpful to ensure your meal is as yummy as possible.. We had Riggs out to clean our very dirty and gross tile grout. The light tan grout was probably not the best choice and after 8 years, it was dirty and dark from all the traffic and spills. We didn't want the grout to be 'painted', we wanted it cleaned. Joel worked his magic and made the tile grout look fantastic! 

We couldn't be happier with Riggs service. They were professional, punctual and friendly. Any time someone asks, I will recommend Riggs without a second thought. 

Get Joel on any tough job and you too will be amazed at his excellent work.. I used to live in Nawlins and my friend took me here to try it out and see if it was the real deal.  It definitely was.  

We went in there with big hangovers and appetites.  The waitress was engaging and attentive.  My friend and I had fun goofing around with her while asking questions and trying to make decisions.  

We ordered a bunch of dungie and crawdads along with some baskets of fried stuff.  Over the course of the next hour we did our best to eat it all--we ordered too much--while having fun with the people at the tables around us.  

All in all it was a great crowd and we had a good time.. The best ramen place in town.  It is worth the long wait outside! The price is reasonable, I don't feel like i am over paying for ramen.  The black sesame oil is delicious.. No matter how many times I've been here, I always have a good time at Pure. While walking around the Forum Shops I decided to stop by and get my friends and I on the guestlist for Saturday night.

We walked over from Vdara and lined up around 10. The line filled up quick and we were let in as soon as they opened, no charge.

The music is always on point, it nevers gets TOO crowded, and theres usually a lot of beautiful people. Thats why I always make an effort to stop by every Vegas trip.. Had the most amazing dinner here with my wife the other night.  Very fancy restaurant, but gives off a warm ambiance.  We were looking for a great meal to spend $150-200 on, and we hit it out of the park with this place located in the Venetian shoppes.  

Quick rundown:

Food was absolutely amazing.  My wife had the BBQ Salmon and she is still talking about it days later.  I had the rib-eye and I have to say that it was on par with any other steak I have had, including my fav Maestro's.  

Service was what you would expect from an establishment like this, impeccable.  Constant checking in and recommendations that were absolutely perfect!  Was impressed when I asked for a wine recommendation with my steak I was not told the most expensive bottle they had, rather the one that went best with the meal.

Overall if you are in Vegas and looking for a classy and elegant dinner that will cost you, give this place a try.  I don't believe you will be disappointed.. Great place  . My favorite steak reaturant in Pittsburgh . The bar area could be bigger . The valet's were professional and quick .. This is a great restaurant if you go during the day when the owner is running the kitchen. Everything, from pizza to subs and chicken wings are amazingly good. 5 stars. However, the two times we've been there at night, it's like a different restaurant. Especially the pizza and chicken wings. During the day the wings are crispy and so good. At night the skin is still soft and squishy, and for us that's not so good. 3 stars at night, hence my 4 star average!. The Ghostbar has a great view, but I wouldn't plan to stay there for the entire night.  As their sign clearly states, it's a lounge but not a club. It's the perfect spot to start the night with a drink, but I would head somewhere else before the night really kicks off.. This is a great place to grab a quick sandwich. The quality is FAR superior to Subway and it's just slightly more expensive. I've never had to wait long either. My only real complaint is that there's never much room inside and there's no decent place to wait for your order! The bar/counter seating is very limited. But I think the food is still worth awkwardly standing and waiting in front of someone's table.. Bob is the best! Look no further for wall covering installation. He's a true professional. Quick and flawless installation.. Really one of the best BYOB in Montreal. This little brother of "Quartier general" is a sure hit!  Service is very professional, and well informed. Menu is  varied and very well executed. It is in a rather remote location, but a fun area to visit, with easy parking. The prices are really decent. Bring on your good bottles, and you are sure to have a delicious great time!. The owner is the nicest guy in the world.  The pizza is very solid, but the subs may be better.  The balboa, which is half hot sausage and half meatball is delicious.  The prices are fantastic.. Great food terrible pop music playing while eating. Everyone complain for me. They should be playing some crazy Japanese Kyoto music!. So great that there is a restaurant that cares so much about Allergies.  Food was fantastic and staff was very nice and friendly.  Great beer selection as well.. Delicious Mexican Restaurant in Lachine, right by the water! Very good food and authentic atmosphere.

We were strolling around the area and decided to go in to try, was not disappointed! The sangria was great, the food too! Will come back more times!. This place is the best - fantastic / cheap sandwiches and friendly managers who really care about making sure your order is done right. A welcome addition to the downtown lunch rotation.. Loved it.  Big hit with both my kids.. Absolutely amazing. This will be a must for me every time I'm in Vegas. The only down side about this place is the wait time. We got in line at 7:30 pm and didn't get seated until 9:00 pm. And this isn't even the worst time I've heard. There are longer wait times depending what day of the week and what time of day you go. 

I had the Combo Pan Roast. It was delicious. It made the wait time well worth while. 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone along with a warning about how long the wait can be.. My daughter CAN'T pass by here without asking to get something.  All I can say is you had better bring your sweet tooth!. Traditionally, Poland is not recognised for its world class foods - however, without a shadow of a doubt it should be if Bona Deli is a taste of what is to come.

The story goes that when the store first opened, Polish immigrants who hadnt seen thier home for years would come into the deli to smell the smells of Poland. Indeed, the smell of fresh Polish bread often greets you as you enter the small deli situated on South Clerk street.

Bona Deli trades in meats, breads, speciality Polish vodka's (a personal favourite of mine) and various other wonders which I am yet to discover - mainly because the packaging is often in Polish, something I dont speak at all.

While I could sing the praises of Bona Deli all day, it does have a few draw backs - namely the quite expensive prices and how quickly it runs out of its most popular items, more than once causing dissapointment.

Regardless of this however, Bona Deli is a great deli  - with real Polish passion.. I've seen the show for 4 consecutive years. Each time, there are 4 or 5 new bits. If you're lucky, you'll get to hear Penn play the standup bass before the show - excellent jazz musician. As always, the show is flawless. There just isn't anyone like them anywhere. We usually have been upgraded on our tickets and end up closer to the stage than we expected. 

Aside from their superior act, the one thing that makes me love 'em is what happens after the show. Both come out to greet, take pictures and sign autographs for their fans. I don't mean a few, I mean EVERY PERSON that wants autographs, pics, a hand shake - they get it all. I know of no one who does that. These guys are an 11 on a scale of 1 to 10! Thanks BOSS!. what can I say that hasn't been said already about Capriotti's? Don't think I've had a bad sandwich yet. My favorites are the Bobbie and the grilled italian.

If I had to criticize anything it would be that the roast beef. While it has great flavor it is always so dry. 

Staff is always very friendly at this location. Love that we can order online from work and have it ready to pick up. Saves time and easy to do. 

Suggestions for Capriotti's: different sub rolls (or at least wheat) and some more sandwich combinations.. I've only been here once, but that will change.
Right down the street from me and plenty cheap!  Their lunch specials are $4.99, which is the cheapest I've seen anywhere.
I had the Triple Delight.  Immediately upon opening my container, I knew I liked this place.
HUGE shrimp and strips of meat...THROUGHOUT!  They do not skimp at all.  The taste was great and everything was fresh.  The veggies were cooked just right and all the meats were tender.
This wasn't a combo, so I didn't get to taste their egg-rolls or fried rice.  I'm not a big fan of either, so no big deal.
The service was polite, and the wait time was about 10 minutes.  
Dining in is an option, and if you do, you won't be wowed by the interior.  Its just some chairs and tables setup along the wall...white tile on the floor, and white walls.  Decor isn't their main concern.  But who cares?
Bottom line is you get a lot of high quality food for a great price (my order was $9.25 for a house specialty).  This is now my neighborhood Chinese food place.. This is most popularly referred to as Queen Creeks hidden treasure, well they are not kidding. We have been coming here for years and absolutely love every visit. It is a family owned and operated business and they always treat you like family when you come in. This is a very diverse place and has such charm that it can be a casual afternoon place to go or a dress up date night occasion. The food is always top notch and we are never disappointed. 

The Cuban sandwich is almost always my go to meal. Everything about this sandwich just screams delicious. From the moment it gets close to your mouth there is nothing more enjoyable. 

The name The Deli does not really give you the real impression for what your taste buds are in store for. They have had some fantastic write ups in Sunset Magazine and the Arizona Republic. Check out what the real food critics have to say and trust me take their word for it. 

Best of all they really help to provide a great sense of local community by using as many local Food Purveyors as possible. It is great to see them promoting one another especially in these struggling times.

It is located on San Tan Blvd just east of Power Rd on the North side of the street. It is tucked back in the corner so keep your eyes open so that you don't miss it. This is a great time of year to go out and enjoy dining on their patio. 
It is a good environment for families or couples. It is just a very inviting place to be and lose yourself in one of Blake's wonderful creations or enjoy a glass of wine personally recommend by his wife Nicole.

No matter what you can't go wrong!. Väldigt trevligt, välkomnande och mysigt café i glada färger och fänkål (!) som dekorationer i kylen (åtminstone vid detta tillfälle). Beställa take-away direkt över disken, annars bordsservering.

Allt detta är givetvis positivt, men det som gör Hula till en klockren femma är kaffet! En riktig kaffe är riktigt bra, och t.o.m. en mocha latte är ljusår bort från det sockerblask man får hos Starbucks. Laptopvänligt med gratis wifi (med en ärlig önskan om att köpa något motsvarande priset för en kaffe per använd timme, helt rimligt). Sunshine!. Great practice! Dr B is very through and clear when discussing a pets condition. Location in clean and the staff is friendly. Bonus for not trying slam with costly procedures that aren't needed.. Gelato samples were delicious - cookies and cream was my favorite. Definitely have to stop by if you're at the mall!. This is my stop on the way home 1-2 times per week.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  We love the natural selections and variety that can be changed up every week or so.  Hope that they get the TJ's Coconut Water in again soon!. Service is excellent. Waiters were constantly walking around and refilling everyone's drinks, and they were very responsive considering it was 6pm and crowded. Music volume was just right. A very clean and well-kept restaurant.

I ordered the Big Mouth Bites. The bacon chunks gave it a very nice texture, but overall the meal was alright. I couldn't taste the burger or its toppings either because it was too dull or the (sweet) bread was overpowering. Fries were nice and crunchy.. Unbelievable food for a chain restaurant! Normally we would never go to a chain place for dinner - especially in phoenix - but i could not resist all the pics of their food on facebook.

We started with the spinach/lump crab dip, it was good but not outstanding. I ordered the big bayou platter with stuffed shrimp, bacon wrapped shrimp and lobster - it was excellent (dirty rice was great too). My gf ordered king crab legs - wow - she got the medium and i swear it was a full pound and they tasted great.. This place has a great selection of imported Japanese stuff. Mainly food, but some kitchen stuff and DVDs. Fresh sushi every day too. Just don't expect much English. The people do speak it fairly well though.. Very pleasant experience.  Service was awesome and very very friendly.  Food tasted great.  prices are high, but work it.  The ambiance is superb and the view from the top of The Hotel is amazing.

Highly recommend for a quite night of fine dining.. Love their take home pizza.... cannot believe the quality / quantity of food.

I ask for double pepperoni - we GET double pepperoni...  LOVE the store... NOT the cheapest... I don't WANT the cheapest.  Definitely worth the difference.. Best gym in town. I love to train here and everyone is great. Jay is the best professor there is and I'm proud to be a part of his team. 

Lots of class options, the other student are awesome, facility is clean... do yourself a favor and SIGN UP!. Heated pool so we could go swimming in -20 degree winter weather? O, Canada!

It's right above an underground station, which is very convenient, and within walking distance of a fair amount of sightseeing locations and bars/restaurants.

Rooms were a bit small, but comfortable. No messes or any other problems.

The hotel bar is a bit costly, but we only had a few drinks here to wind down a very epic night of celebrating New Year's.

For breakfast, I suggest walking to Eggspectations nearby!

The front desk was extremely helpful in recommending places nearby to go eat and drink (many things were closed that weekend).. just leased a 2014 Audi  x4. It was the easiest car buying experience I ever had.  I took my wife to the dealer on Sunday she picked out a car I contacted Neil and completed the deal  by e-mail and phone.  The car was delivered and paperwork done at my house by Irving and Luke.  Luke went over every feature with my wife, linked her iPhone and Luke and Irv even set up the garage door opener.  Going way above and beyond.. Better than average food for a buffet. Varies a little bit which is why I am not giving them five stars. Nice ambiance.. My wife and I stopped by to grab a bite to eat last Friday night.  The place was packed!  I was pleasantly surprised by the great customer service and how fast the food came out.  The only reason I'm not going to give them 5 stars is because the food was not amazing.  It was good, but not great and I do not give 5 starts to restaurants that do not have great food.. Great place! We started off the vegas trip for a friend that is getting married here. The Liter beers were great but what was better was seeing the bachelor get spanked after taking a shot. priceless.

I highly recommend this place. The food was pretty good too and they had a live band while we were there on a thursday night.. I've been here multiple times now and they have Great service and even better food. All the staff is real nice. Chef will visit the table and if the meal isn't perfect, they will fix it without making a big deal about it. It's a local business and its small but totally worth the trip!. This review won't be what it should because I only had a light lunch however, I believe this place is the dining gem of NY NY. I was in Vegas on business staying at NY NY and had a limited time for lunch Tuesday Oct. 9. A co-worker and his wife had gone there for dinner the previous evening and had only great things to say about the food, music, and service. Even though I was only there for lunch, I became a believer!

The atmosphere is somewhat dark but somehow appropriate to the theme. My server was a round older lady with a smile that never ended, and a strong need to please. I ordered a Newcastle Ale and inquired about the Concannon soup. She congratulated me on the choice and tole me I wouldn't be disappointed and she was soooo right. A rich creamy soup made from potatoes, cabbage, and garnished with an incredibly lean and delightful smoked bacon. My co-workers had raved about the macaroni & cheese side dish. I love good mac & cheese so my curiousity go the best of me. This too was quite rich with a creamy full flavored cheese baked to a very hot and satisfying taste and texture. The couple sitting at the next table had ordered onion rings and I have to say they looked home made with a hand dipt golden batter.

My next trip to Vegas will find me enjoying a full dinner at this delightful watering and dining spot!. I can honestly say I'll always  be a customer. There so amazing. They had me feeling like a kid in a candy shop. It's a definite must try if u haven't.. I had Shawarma, Dad had Falafel. Pita was the best we've had outside Israel. Falafel was best we've had in the US. Shawarma was perfectly cooked, pita was thick and soft. Easily the best Mediterranean meal we've had in the US. I do recommend you try this place.. Service, food and experience were all fantastic!

I enjoyed the Manhattan Clam Chowder with the Roast Beef Dip (French Dip with a side of Au Jus). Very filling.

If one of your dopey friends suggests "let's go to the Carnegie deli because they have big sandwiches", punch them in the throat and tell them about Zoozacrackers.  There is a reason this one is rated higher.. Look, there is only one thing on the menu: chocolate. If you share my love, that's all you need to know. But once you walk into this restaurant, you will understand that what you previously understood could be done with chocolate was just child's play. Pass through Juliette and Chocolate's doors, and you have walked into the ranks of the MLC -- Major League Chocolatiers.

While everything contains chocolate in some way, the menu is amazingly extensive, and incorporates so many different elements that a trip to their website is recommended, as I cannot describe them all here. We only ordered one item which we split, the Trifle, at first glance was a tall coffee mug with layers of whipped cream and brownie. On the side, melted dark chocolate (no sweetener added) was served in a small pitcher. Poured on top, the sweetness of the cream and brownie bites enhanced the chocolate, while the unsweetened chocolate tempered the sugariness of the Trifle. Just an amazing presentation and wonderful dish. I need to go back and try everything in this place.. As a native of Los Angeles, I grew up eating lots of Mexican food. Three Amigos, hands down, is the BEST Mexican food in Charlotte (and I have tried most all of them in the past 23+ years here). The atmosphere is rustic and comfortable. The servers are attentive. At the Central Ave. location ask for Margarita (the server they named the drink after). The cervezas are C-O-L-D COLD. My favorite selection is the Enchiladas Poblanas. It is smothered in what has to be the BEST molé sauce I have ever tasted. I eat there most every week. It's THAT good.. Very tasty, true New York style pizza. The deserts were above average as well. The toppings were a little expensive for the small/personal pizza at almost $2 each, but the flavor was worth it. 

We had drinks and desert (the pick 3 deserts for $10 made up for the price of the pizza and we were not disappointed). Will def be back here or picking up. 

You can't miss this pizza!. Big eye Tuna Tartar is on point! The food portions are a little small for a dude like me that likes to shovel food towards my face on certain occasions. With that being said, the night I went with my wifey and our friend, I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Joe, one of the assistant managers was off the hook and the ambience was jumping that night after a few glasses of wine. The waiters and Joe took especially good care of our table and that locked in the 5th star! Good people, good food, good wine= good occasional spot for some fine dining..... We stayed here one night during our cross-country trip. The room was really nice and very clean. The hotel itself seemed a little too spread out, and was difficult to find our tower. Once we found the tower everything was great. Good food in the shops attached and the casino was pretty nice too. I would come back here.. I enjoy this facility. Especially since it is less than one minute away from where I work for The Man,

Modern, clean facility with all new equipment. Mostly friendly people.

It costs more than I really would love to pay, as I'm not a seven-day-a-week muscle head, but I also like not being crowded when I work out.. I come about once a week. Its a nice place, good vibes, great service (never had a problem) hookahs are always clean and hit nice. Servers and all employees are awesome and friendly.


Sun-tues by bowl but its more laid back and you can watch football games which is awesome and music isnt too loud.

Thursday - Saturday are pretty poppin musics loud usually tons of people good if your tryin to dance and turn up.

Food is A+ their zookies are delicious,  loved the buffalo sliders. And even the fried gouda mac n cheese bites are bomb. Only problem is food takes alittle while to come out depending in what you get but its totally worth it!

Id give it 4.75 stars due to me thinking there is always room for improvement.. What a deal - a $15.00 car wash for FREE.

This was the Grand Opening weekend, and they were offering a special deal, everybody on Fri / Sat received a FREE $15.00 Car Wash.

This is a new location in Charlotte located at the corner of Tyvola Rd and Old Pineville Rd across the street from Keffer Pontiac.

This location offers free vacuums with every wash, and they do offer a variety of washes to choose from ranging $5.00 - $15.00. 

They do offer monthly packages as well, for high volume users and those who just want to maintain a clean car.

Would highly recommend this location, while it is not touch free, it is very gentle on your finish.

The staff was very friendly, and should you need assistance, they are readily available.

Thanks for the Free Wash, I will back to have my car washed here frequently.

Oh Yeah, the vacuums rock! 
Lots of suction, it will pick up everything that is not bolted down......the dirt must hate this place. (Just wish I had a bowling ball to test the suction like that old commercial.)

5 Stars for Wiki Wiki Car Wash

NCFoodGuy. This place is very comfy, laid back vibe, serving only bottled beer and a full bar. The food is not bad. It's not very authentic, but your typical Mexican food. This place is really busy at night and it's a big hang out spot. I don't go here much, but never remember ever being disappointed in service or food.. The Old Fashioned is the first place everyone in Madison will tell a Madison-neophyte to go for one simple rule: it's Wisconsin with the volume turned up to 11.  The menu is large, but not nearly as large as the portions.  I recommend sharing the lazy-Suzanne starters, or maybe just having them as your meal.  They also have good cheese-curds and salads (ironically enough).  I always leave with left-overs and, with the exception of the usually long wait-time for a table, I have never been disappointed.  The tap-list is extensive and I think exclusively Wisconsinite, as well.  Their brunch isn't bad either!. Apparently this place gets crazy busy sometimes but I was able to get right in and sit down on a Wednesday morning. I didn't need anything fancy but Oskar really listened to what I wanted and took the time to give me a great cut. He wasn't happy until I was happy and I left feeling like million bucks. I'll be coming back for sure!. Came back here with a bigger group, got a table on the dance floor, so this time, no beautiful view BUT instead, we traded to be in front of the DJ's..i can say, equally worth it..and i want to say, had a freakin BLAST, moon does not disappoint.  one of my best clubbing experiences EVER, hands down...and I'm saying this even after a night of craziness (not the good kind, but the bad kind when people r just TOO drunk), I still had a great time!!  I once again, cannot wait to go back!. FAITH IS AN AWESOME BARTENDER.  The lunch special- 20 wings, a plate of French fries and a salad///////  12 bucks. AND IT WAS GREAT/////WTF DO YOU GUYS WANT.  24 oz beers for 3 bucks.  This place is worth the visit.. Went in there to ask a few questions and look for a specific wine opener. They were very helpful! Highly recommend it!. Almost always prompt, polite, service.  The prices are beyond reasonable, and the quality has never lacked.  I would recommend anyone (who does not want SUPER traditional decor and feel) try this restaurant.. I can now tell people that I have been on the Effiel Tower, well the one in Las Vegas. 

This attraction is certainly a must see. The tower is so beautiful to look at especially during the night time. 

The view gets even better when you go to the top of the Effiel Tower and get an amazing view of Las Vegas. The view will leave you in aww. Fantastic views. It's breath taking. You can also see the fountain show from up top since its across the street. 

No worries you will not fall off. Everything is caged around. 

It's half the size of the original, but a must see and experience. 

Definitely one of those places where you must take pictures and just soak in the views.. Press is one of my absolute favorite spots in Uptown.  

The service has always been phenomenally good.

The wine has been great and well priced.

The food has been very good, though I've never had a meal there (the Antipasti plate, the desserts, etc).

Great place to start, end or spend your whole night.. Located just off Wynn road and Spring Mountain in China Town Las Vegas...I give this place 4 stars straight to the point only because I keep coming back for more. That must mean something, considering there is nothing really special about this place. It's as simple as simplicity gets. This small AYCE Korean BBQ has enough choices to satisfy those Korean craving tastebuds. But on any given night be prepared to wait anywhere from a reasonable 30 minutes to a sometimes ridiculous 2 hour standby. It is pretty much a hit or miss, just expect the expected. After 10:00pm is a discounted price of $13.99 compared to the $16.99 regular price, which is still not bad.  Just know that the discounted price will not include short ribs and steamed egg. You can opt out those prices to get those menu items included.

This place has been on KTNV channel 13 news for Dirty Dining before, but I guess sometimes the dirtiest place taste good! (No pun intended but not saying that is a good status to acclaim). The times I have been here however were clean enough, but behind the kitchen only the prying eyes will know.   This place could improve on size, but I think renovating the place is out or question.  Again this place is not anything special, but a local hot spot amidst the Chinatown district and open late for those night owl cravers. I do recommend it though!. Saw reviews thought I would give it a try. went here last night had a red chili chimi was great. will be my knew favorite Mexican restaurant. loved the chips and salsa, service was great and food reminded me of home. Will be back.. Best tapas place in Las Vegas and probably in most places I've been to.  Love the seafood paella (I had them put the sausage and beef bits on the side).  The tilapia was good if you like it lemony.  If you don't like it to be too zesty, you can always ask them to put less lemon slices, or have them on the side.  My friend raved about his mac and cheese, which disappeared in his mouth in less than 3 minutes.  

It's also opened late too which was a plus!. Travelling from Hawaii, I read good things about this place and also got a good deal on it. Although Vegas had just been hit by the 'North Winds' and temperatures dropped to 50 degrees with 30 mph winds, I wanted to get my Greek fix and visit neighboring UNLV. I had my menu items picked out weeks in advance, so I stepped up and ordered.

Hummus side- 3 1/2-stars- The hummus as clean, basic and creamy. Obviously, you get a nice layer of olive oil on top. This comes with a steaming back of pita bread, wrapped warm and tight. I'd consider this a good compliment to any dish. But, if you're ordering a plate with hummus or been-there-done-that, I'd recommend baba ganoush as another option.

Feta with Olives side- 4-stars- A beautiful, briny dish also served with it's own batch of pita bread. (I hear the wheat pita is the best, as one man exclaimed.) The huge, purplish Kalamata olives are so sweet and salty, with very small seeds. It was just a satisfaction biting into these. The feta was also brisk and briny. It was almost too much salt for one dish, but eating them with a pita helped to spread the distinct flavors out a little.

Falafel Plate- 4-stars- Served with five falafels, the spices hit you immediately. The falafel were a little drier, yet also crispier than I've been accustomed to. There is a light coating of tzatziki to add some moisture. The Israeli salad is a mixture of cucumber, tomato, onion, and cilantro almost like a salsa. Amazingly, the flavor and freshness reminded me of a lomi lomi in Hawaii (without the seafood obviously). My suggestion, as you also get pitas with this plate--add the salad into the pita, then pack on some hummus to keep all the loose pieces together. Throw on the falafel last, then enjoy the mixture of flavors as they hit your taste-buds. The plate is huge, and all three was more than enough to stuff me beyond capacity. Yet, I didn't feel weighed down, which is a good thing. Healthy and delicious!

Atmosphere- The set-up is very open and casual, with light music playing in the background. Check out the seats in the rear of the restaurant if you want a more intimate feel while you're eating--with pillows, etc. rather than wooden seats. The decorations are light, but there is a nice bookshelf dedicated to the beers they carry. Wi-fi is also available, yet secured, so I guess you gotta ask for the password--there was no info on the receipt nor the buzzer they give you with your order. I did find it amusing, there was sriracha sauce available as a hot sauce. I don't know if it's made it all the way to Greece, or the local clientele just loves it, but sriracha is definitely a good, comforting sign of discriminating tastes.

Service- Service is very casual and friendly. You do get a buzzer when your order is ready, and it's picked up on the side window away from where you make your order. Beyond this, you don't really speak to the servers.

Conclusion- Definitely a quiet, humble place, just a hop-skip-and-a-run across the street from UNLV. It seems to attract both student and staff, especially with the variety of options between beer and wi-fi and sriracha (still amazed to see this sauce there). It does lack some excitement and pizzazz, but I'm sure that comes in often enough from the front doors.. Fair pricing, solid food and decent atmosphere. Good service also. They also play a trivia game here Monday nights. Good stuff...man vs food atomic wing challenge!. I've been meaning to get to the Citizen Public House since I heard about it - been on their mailing list, etc., but just never managed to get there.

Finally, a friend was in town and wanted to grab dinner in old town - he said gastropub, so I told him to meet me at Citizen.

I didn't realize that the Cowboy Ciao chef who originated their fabulous chopped salad was the man behind Citizen Public House - when I found that out, we had to start with that!  In case you haven't had it, please allow me to explain.  The plate arrives with lines of chopped salad items, looking like a bunch of colored stripes.  The stripes include dried corn, Israeli couscous, smoked salmon, asiago, pepitas, tomatoes, arugula and currants.  That is topped with a housemade buttermilk dressing and mixed up.  It's a fabulous mix of flavors and textures - a truly wonderful thing to eat.  If you haven't eaten it before, stop reading this and head to Citizen Public House.  Now.  It's ok, I'll wait.

I decided to try the buttermilk chicken for my main course.  Wow.  I was expecting fried chicken (that's usually what comes after 'buttermilk' in a chicken recipe title), but it was grilled.  It was incredibly flavorful.  Very very good.

We ordered a couple of desserts for the table:  Pig in the Orchard (apple and bacon bread pudding with maple ice cream and blueberry sauce) and the Peanut Butter Strata Bar (white chocolate ice cream, peanut butter crunch and strawberry jam).  The Pig in the Orchard was spot on - order it.  I was a bit 'meh' on the Peanut Butter Strata Bar.

Cool vibe at the restaurant, and right in the heart of Old Town (kitty corner from Cartel Coffee - which, of course, you know already, because you always get your espresso there, right?). Awesome place to get a haircut. Staff very friendly. Great customer service. All the staff are personable and engaging.

Merry Christmas!!. Outstanding new restaurant in Old Town - looks like 3rd time's the charm in this location. 

Previous owner(s) had tried a few different things that apparently didn't pan out. Well, the new owner of this spot apparently knows what's up.

The specialty cocktails (which I'm not normally into) are fantastic, and their wine on tap is awesome. The food is out of this world - it's all different. They are really into locally sourced fresh ingredients and being earth conscious (which I really appreciate) and you can taste the difference in the food. 

I had a pepperoni pizza and shared some bruschetta that was crazy good, and my girlfriend had a chicken dish I sampled that was also amazing. The cheese on the pizza was creamy - it was really unusual, but I scarfed down every bit of it. The crust was delicious as well. 

The best part is that I don't feel boated or whatever. I was full, but didn't have a gut bomb. We even split a dessert that was like their take on an adult s'more. It was ridiculous. 

Evo should be a yelper's paradise. This is going to be a really hot spot for an after work happy hour when you don't feel like having a Corona and chips and salsa. It's also a fantastic spot for a date night. It's an awesome place for locals to come and unwind with a drink and some noshes.

There's a really comfy atmosphere and everyone that works there seems passionate and welcoming. I hope they keep it up after the "we're new" wears off. I wish this place all the success and I hope it's around for years to come. I'm definitely going to be back here lots. Had a wonderful time and a happy tummy.. There is one awesome thing about Lush Burger and many many average or just ok things. First the awesome thing. They are kid  friendly and have Wikki Stix instead of boring old crayons. Ask my nephew how much fun he had. And the shakes are double yum! 

I got the classic burger which looked over cooked at first...but the inside was medium just like I ordered it. Food came out fast! So fast it made me wonder how they did that. It was an ok burger. Chips were good. 

Service was good too. But I laugh at the reviews about the lack of customer service. Having lived in both Scottsdale and the west side....you will always get better service from young people, as a general rule, in the west side. It would take a sociologist to figure out why.

All in all we enjoyed Lush Burger and will be back! Wikki Stix are awesome!

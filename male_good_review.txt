Love this place!! You can sit outside or inside and order anything off the menu and you can bet you will love it! Fresh, wholesome ingredients made by chefs in an open kitchen space. The people working their are highly attentive and will address any need that you have. What I like about this place is that it's not a typical restaurant. You order your food when you get there and receive a number, then they deliver your food to your table and basically leave you to yourself after that. If you have the chance read the Tao of Flower Child that is written on the wall. Enough said.... The sandwich was a bit thin but still good. My steak and meatball pho was good but a bit fragrant. Like it had to much star anise. Over all the food was good and so was our experience there.. Just like the last time I used this service, I am very satisfied. They were on time, did the requested work and were very professional. I'll use this service again for certain.. Great Gym even  greater members! After moving from Texas where my crossfit/weight loss journey began. I was stressed to find a box that could match up with former box. I tried four boxes while looking for a home and then I found max effort. Anyone that has crossfitted (not sure if that's a word) know that the box you choose is an important and can be like the 1st day of a new high school.  Not only are all the members supper cool but the coaches were crazy personal and professional.. The closest In-N-Out to St Louis is Dallas. So while in Phoenix ya just gotta get a couple doubles. Fav franchise burger. Fries are top 5 also.. Our experience with Ace has been great. If there is a problem with the machine they are out here the same day and always friendly. The machines take credit cards and Apple Pay.. After having a bad couple of days over the 4th of July weekend, my wife and I decided to take a chance and go to some place new and so we headed over to the M Resort and Spa!  We were hungry and it was my wife's 50th birthday. We asked a worker on the floor to recommend a place to eat and told us all the restaurants in the hotel were excellent, give that woman a raise! Great answer! We asked about the Oyster Bar over at Anthony's Prime Steak and Seafood. She told us she is a huge fan of the pan roast and that's what we were looking for! so we head over there and it was not busy but it was not empty either.  We sat at the Oyster Bar area and the aromas there was just inviting. I have to agree 100% with the last reviewer "Amazing food, ambiance, and service." It sure was indeed. We both had the Shrimp pan roast and one thing is for sure, they did their homework and went to the Palace Station oyster bar to see what made them so uniquely amazing and how was Anthony's version be a little bit better, the answer! More flavor and bigger SHRIMP!!!! OH HELL YEAH BABY! THAT'S THE TICKET! We were just blown away by the dish I enjoyed with a glass of pinot noir.  The chief's that evening were awesome too, even let us have a sample of their soups, we are coming back! 
Once are meals were done, we were ask if we wanted deserts, I mentioned it was my wife's birthday... Although it was the 4th we were a day late to celebrate because of things needed  to be taken care of the day before. As soon as I mentioned Birthday our awesome waiter just stopped me and said he'd be right back. Few minutes later he came back with a chocolate moose that was out of this world and made our evening that much extra special! 

If you never been to the M but you've seen drive into Vegas from the I15, do yourself and favor and check it out!

I'm not a food critique, just a fan of good food that likes to write about my experience, So go out and experience food and be the judge.. His work is outstanding. Finds the problem and fixes it. Would recommend him to anyone needing some home repair. I would not use anyone else. He installed a new engineered wood floor in our home after removing outdated tile flooring. Excellent job and well done. He also replaced rotted facia boards. A great person to fix your homeowner problems.. The new ALDI on Baum was pretty much a revelation for me once I moved back into the country. I was in Panama for over a year until this fall, and I use to do all of my shopping at the Giant Eagle- which is always a mad house!- and I noticed that the ALDI had just opened a block down. I knew the limitations of ALDI before I went in- the selection isn't particularly great, produce isn't great, they don't take credit cards, no bags for the groceries, etc. and maybe this is why I was able to really appreciate it for what it is. For me, being a poor graduate student in the East End, this place is perfect for all of my needs. I'm not a huge cook or food connoisseur, so I understand why others have been a little more on the harsh side to ALDI- but I love it. The people in the parking deck guiding you to your spot are smiling and always nice, people are always willing to give me one of their quarters for the cart when I forget it :), and nobody can beat their prices. I stock up on hummus, as it's only 1.99 per container (compared to almost 4 bucks at Giant Eagle)- and it's really good! So, as I'm not particularly picky about what I put into my shopping cart, I found all the mainstays and items that I need.  Furthermore, the people working there are always more than friendly and quick ringing you up (a perk of not bagging). I will continue to shop there while a smile on my face.. If you're into hot dogs and especially those with toppings aplenty,   JJ's is your spot.   Personally,   I'm not a dog aficionado and I always get suckered into the deal of the day with all fixins.   Give me a well-cooked, Sahlen's brand hot đog with 'kraut and mustard and iI'm a happy guy.   They've got those too, just pull back the reins and keep it simple--hard to do at JJ's Red Hots.   Overall,  a great experience. 

PS:  the nachos are hand cut and fried potato chips which do not hold up to the heat and weight of the toppings.   Prefer good ol' corn chips for this appetizer.. Damn, check out Hiland H.'s Nachos in the pics, that's exactly what we had and we still couldn't finish the motherfucker. 

The portions are ricockulous! 

We also had some of the margaritas, and one of them was so strong and nasty, I couldn't even finish it! That's actually pretty cool, I've never NOT been able to finish a margarita. Can I have some margarita with my tequila?  ;-)

The prices are alright, and the food is very good. STRONG DRINKS! It was walking distance from the Harrah's, where we stayed.. Great for an after clubbing experience.

My group and I had gotten back to our room early at Elara after clubbing, and we all realized that we were down for some food... Where to go? SECRET PIZZA!!!
So we hopped over to the Cosmopolitan and searched for the hole in the wall.. it's not on the directory, so you gotta know where you're looking. Just ask any drunkards walking around with slices of pizza.
Anyway, we found it no problem, not a newb, but HELL... this is the first time I waited in a long line for it.  Oh and you gotta have some skills blocking people off because there are mad line cutters.  I was able to stop on chick and her friends when i realized she thought we were drunk and could slip by us with "our friends are up ahead". Gotcha. Although she was cool and joined us later at blocking off the other douchebags that tried to get through. Some blocked, some got through.. gotta choose your battles.

oh yeah, the food.. bomb.... make sure you sprinkle parm cheese, red pepper flakes, or that green herbstuff(dried parsley flakes?) onto your pizza for extra an special zazz.. My wife and I were going from Mandalay Bay to the Luxor when we saw a long line standing outside a restaurant at about 1:30 in the afternoon.  The curiosity got to us so we went over to take a look and discovered that people were waiting in line for an opportunity to eat, what they say, is the best burger in Las Vegas.  I gave up eating meat 9 years ago, however, my wife, the carnevor, desperately wanted to go back the next day so I tagged along hoping to find something for a non meat eater to munch on.  Well. to my surprise, they served this KILLER Salmon burger with a broiled Maine lobster tail as a topping.  YUMI YUMI.  My wife had her KOBE burger,  medium rare with roasted Foir Gras as a topping on a home mad Ciabatta bun.  It smelled and looked so good I almost converted back to meat, but I didn't..  Anyway, you gotta try this place.  My wife spoke to the owner/chef, Hubert Keller, and he told her that he will be opening a new Burger Bar in San Francisco at Union Square.(We live in San Francisco)  We are looking forward to another great experience at the Burger Bar.  The service was great.... I've been coming here for years and have been through a management change at least once. Current owners have been here for a while and I haven't had any problems with service for a while. I normally get the middle of the road wash and it does the trick for me. Definitely feel like I get my money's worth. It can get busy at times and in the summer the indoor seating is limited, but if your looking for a good hand wash this place it's definitely worth a try.. I agree with those who say this place is overrated and overhyped.  Good, not great, sushi and the prices are high.  The upside is the selection of high end tuna, the downside is they are often out of one or more types.  A good place to be seen around Madison.

I have recently been stopping here for lunch and have to compliment them on their quick service and reasonable ($15 for 7 nigiri and a tuna or other basic roll) lunch specials.  They always have a good selection of fish as the chef's choice, not just the typical tuna and salmon combo.  I am giving them an extra star because they really shine at lunchtime.  The service is great too.. This place is awesome. Food is delicious. Its a ma and pop feel. Great service. Every person so far has been very nice and quick.. Way back when this used to be part of a used car lot.  Shortly after I moved to the area Staples took over the building and I have been coming here since.  Service varies depending on the folks working here at any given time.  This latest experience was very good.  I needed business cards and envelopes because of a move.  If I had just gotten the business cards they will print them while you wait and their prices have come down considerably over the last year.  Because my order was bundled with the envelopes I get to wait a couple of weeks.  And they now will ship it all to me at no extra charge.. I LOVE this place! I don't even know where to begin but every time I've been here I've always had very good experiences! Aliante is definitely a great place for locals to go when you want a quiet place away from all the madness on the strip! Even though I'm kind of upset it's no longer a stations casino I'm glad they haven't lost that "We Love Locals" kind of feel to it! The employees are all awesome and even though this place is about 10-15 miles out of my way when I get tired of Red Rock this place never fails! Whether it's for gambling, going to the movies or even staying over night you can't go wrong with selecting Aliante! Facility is always kept very clean and neat which is great! I love that it doesn't have that over powering cigarette smoke smell that most casinos do so that's another reason o love to play here!. They are really amazing.   I took my car in to get the tail light repaired and they did it in less than 10 minutes and didn't even charge me!

Thank you. Great hot dogs, the beef sandwiches are amazing. Those are the only two things I have had here. Will try a burger next time. They look good. The crinkle cut fries are fantastic as well. Big eating area and very family friendly casual. Parking can be tough. Don't like asking for refills.. Try the baked wings with the oriental seasonings.   Awesome and healthy.  Great tequila selection and friendly service.  Cold beer could be priced better but good.. Good Location. Consistent in their food quality and service.  Just what I expect from a Subway!

The line crew is fast and efficient.  This location is a bit smaller so seating is limited, however.  During the lunch rush, it may be better to get it to go and mozy on down to the park down the street.. I've never written a review before, not because other places weren't good or anything but I just felt like my comment wouldn't add any discussion to the other hundreds of reviews

That being said I think this place deserved a review and a 5 star one at that ! It's a little pricey but for what you get you cant beat it! Health food is a rarity over In this part of town and it's not some franchise or anything like that it's a nice family owned business

Food was great and they are really willing to change your order to fit your diet plan! 

I got the asparagus side salad steak and chicken and it's easily the freshest food I've had including home cooked foods 

They also offer a meal plan for 6 or 9 days and that might be something I try in the future but for now I just got the one meal

All in all id definitely give this place a try if I were you because I'm sure glad I did 

It's right next to the kfc and Starbucks if you weren't sure where they are located !. OYSTAAA BARRR

Check it this place is hidden in a secret ghetto part of Las Vegas in a Hotel called Harrahs.

First things first if your broke you wont be able to pay!
Oysters range from about 20-30 dollars! but I have to say.. ITS SUPER DELICIOUS NO JOKE! Ofcourse just with oyster you wont fill yourself up but they actually give you free bread and chips which does the job!

The people working their tend to watch sports game on T.V. so they tend to forget about their customers so you have to speak loudly to them to get their attention... 
- 1 star for that.

Overall though if you just want some oysters this place does the job!

PEACE. Great service, well worth the price.  Amazing attention to detail.  They really treat you well here!. Maybe I'm partial... but my mom Pauline Braha knows exactly what my hair needs. I'm a customer for life!. Awesome!!! This is the best sushi I have ever had, my wife and I are complete sushi snobs  and have traveled all over the U.S. and the world, I have only found one comparable restaurant in Santa Barbara.. Yoshi treats you like family, the whole staff is incredible. You will usually wait to be seated but that is a sign of greatness as far as I'm concerned.. Absolutely worth the wait. If you want a high quality meal on the strip that doesn't feel like they're robbing you blind, this is the place to go.  You really can't beat Mon Ami Gabi's steak frites.  And they have a nice brunch in the mornings too.  In terms of atmosphere, of all the places you could go for a meal on the strip, this is probably one of the less pretentious that doesn't feel completely manufactured.  I'm a fan.. Pretty decent place and you can't get it wrong. You pick the toppings you want and watch them make it right in front of you. Take a seat and it will be right out in just a few minutes. Pretty awesome place!. After our clutch went out in just about the worst place possible--one mile from the Hoover Dam--we called our Vegas friends and asked what we should do!  They said to take the car to Jack and Sons on Russell Road, that they do good work and are reasonably priced.

I really wish we had a Jack and Sons in San Diego.  They not only completed the work by the end of the day, they were extremely FRIENDLY the whole time, were never annoyed by my calling to check in, and the price, well I thought it was going to be a couple hundred more than what it ended up being.  So they are VERY fair!

If I ever dare to drive to Vegas again, these guys are on speed dial.. I have been looking for a good  haircut for sometime. Today Belinda cut my hair @ Friendly barbershop and was very pleased with the way she cut my hair. She took her time timed my mustache and fussed over the haircut. I will be back.. Went back to Ann's after trying other Chinese food in the area without satisfaction.  This time we received very good service and both of our main courses were excellent. My wife thought her egg drop soup was very good. My hot n sour soup was somewhat cold and bland but as stated, the main course made up for it.. Always a must when we visit Vegas. Be sure to try their in house made cigars.  Great service and a delicious smoke.. So, apparently, they've "temporarily" lost their liquor license. I'm not sure of the details, but when I arrived earlier this week, I discovered the beer coolers were locked-up with chains and padlocks, with a Spanish sign that read "Not serving beer right now." 

I inquired with the waitress and she told me they had their license suspended. Not sure of the details, but I wonder if it had something to do with allowing people to self-serve beer without checking IDs? I never did understand this inconsistent system...

That said, the tacos are consistently *awesome*. 

+ Steak taco - one of (if not the) best in Madison
+ Campechano taco - great, although chorizo is often very greasy
+ Chicken taco - not super seasoned, but still quality and delicious

- Chips leave much to be desired 
- Salsa too watery
+ Hot sauces are great

+ Friendly service
- Totally absent service after initial delivery of food
+ They take credit/debit, but you can't write-in a tip, so bring some cash. Best pulled pork I have EVER eaten. Food was great, super fast and very reasonable for BBQ. Next time I go back I'm getting all pulled pork.. The pool to be at no matter what. San bottom is so cool.. They had different varieties of kisses that I have never tried. Yum! Did you know that Jolly Rancher candles existed? Because I sure didn't. Lots of cool stuff but not as cool at the M&M store across the street.. The best place to hang out with friend over breakfast and business meeting over lunch. It's clean and crowded, but the environment is just cozy enough to sit for a long time. Free refill coffee makes it perfect. 

The only downside is that their wi-fi is really slow and unstable.. We noticed Lulu's while at the gas station across the street. We decided to come in for a 'date breakfast'. The staff was welcoming and friendly, assisting us with the ordering process and menu items. We settled on the Breakfast Burrito, a cheese Danish, OJ, and Pumpkin Spice Latte. All items ordered were very, very good! The burritos were huge and both of us ate every bite! Atmosphere is quaint and neighborhood-y...a nice change from the large chain restaurants. We definitely recommend!. Is it Chasiu or is it Charsiu? Many people for generations have wondered. Watch this video in the link. It will explain everything about Charsiu/Chasiu.

There are 3 restaurants in Las Vegas that specialize specifically in Ramen. First, is the long reigning Monta Noodle house which prides itself on being an oldschool traditional Ramen house. 2nd, is Anime Ramen which is a very happening hangout for teenagers and college kids. 3rd is the brand new Ramen Sora. The thing I will admit about Ramen Sora is that it has the best customer service out of the three. And all three have excellent customer service, so it shows you how much more effort the workers at SORA put into their job. 

All 3 major Ramen houses have barely anything in common. The menu isn't very similar and the taste of the Ramen has absolutely nothing in common.  One of the only things they all have in common is that all 3 places hand craft their noodles daily. And, that's why it tastes so firm and fresh.

The Charsiu here is triple the thickness of Monta and Anime. But, they use a totally different style of Charsiu. Traditional Ramen Charsiu is cooked by rolling up the belly portion of pork into a wooden log and steaming it with soy sauce. That's why it falls apart so easily. SORA uses the same cut of pork but cooks and slices it in a different method.

They give a free egg, instead of charging extra like Monta does. And they don't charge extra for butter. Like respected Yelper "Jen G" pointed out, the Ramen here is packed beyond capacity with butter. It will shorten your life, but butter makes Ramen taste exceptionally great. That's a plus. 

The broth of the Miso Ramen tastes very similar to Santouka. Apparently, this is the common taste of Sapporo style Ramen. But, unlike Santouka, the broth here is far more higher quality and more ingredients are added for flavor. For those who don't know, Santouka is that giant chain of Ramen houses that have locations all over Japan. 

Our good friend Alex S says he likes SORA better than Monta because SORA doesn't have Non-Japanese Asian customers. I didn't know that Non-Japanese Asians weren't allowed to eat Ramen? And he was pissed off that one of the servers appears to be of Chinese descent. Hey Alex, everyone respects you for your knowledge of Japanese cuisine and we all know that you are a current citizen of Japan but, if Filipinos, Chinese, and Koreans didn't come to SORA, this place would quickly go out of business. There is only a little over 1 million Japanese-Americans still left in the United States, and most of them do not live in Las Vegas. Full blooded Japanese-Americans are one of the smallest minority groups in America, and are very rare to just find. According to the 2010 census there was only around 5000 Japanese-Americans in Las Vegas(and many are only half Japanese). I am sure that the Japanese owners of these restaurants have the complete opposite attitude as you, and actually love the fact that non-Japanese people come to support their business. Also, be happy that the server wasn't Japanese and that  most Japanese-Americans don't have to work difficult min-wage restaurant jobs, and instead work as corporate business executives, lawyers, doctors, and engineers here in America.  

It's also worth noting that Miso Ramen was invented in the island of Hokkaido. So, you absolutely must order one of the Miso Ramen variations when you eat at SORA. Why? Because SORA is a Sapporo style Ramen house, and Sapporo is the capital city of Hokkaido. 

In conclusion, SORA easily is one of the best Ramen houses in Las Vegas. But, we are still left not knowing if it's Charsiu or Chasiu.. From the decor to the service to the food, it's all great in my book.  Who would have guessed there was a diamond hidden in this easy to overlook little place?!

The atmosphere and decoration of the restaurant make you feel like you've transported a little to Classic Vegas.  Every detail, the booths, old film reel ceiling, and eagle statuettes, are excellent touches.

Service was very friendly, quick, and not overly attentive.  Every person we encountered was personable and willing to help.  Our waiters suggested better options based on our taste, which did not disappoint.  Chad the GM even stopped by our table to chat a little, take our picture, and thank us for dining there. 

Delicious variety of bread for starters; perfect temperature on the medium Filet Mignon; and a rich yet refreshing salmon dish to die for. The Creme Brulee with Basil Lime Sherbet was amazing and the Peach Galette was a perfect way to end a great meal.

It's very rare now to find a place in Vegas on the Strip where you can avoid all the traffic, lines, crowds, and utter chaos but still enjoy a truly amazing dining experience.. This is one of my preferred bakeries on the strip where I tend to stop by every time that I'm in Vegas. It is a small outlet hidden behind the escalator on the casino level of the Venetian, so may be a little hard to find if you don't know what you are looking for. They seem to be pretty popular as I've encountered a line each time, but it moves fast. I've tried a bunch of their baked good like cupcakes, chocolate croissants, danish, scones, sticky buns, beignets, cookies etc over my visits. All their products are fresh and taste great specially the sticky buns which are loaded with pecans and have a coating of caramelized sugar which balances the taste of the pecans very well still they tend to be on the sweet side. The cream danish on the other hand has only a mildly sweet filling that will appeal to people who don't want their deserts too sweet. Prices for most items are around the $4 mark which is in-lines with what you pay at other bakeries on the strip.. Raunchy comedy meets Cirque du Soleil.

I was there for an early Valentine's Day celebration with Allyson, and it was almost a full house.

We were sitting right behind the love seats, and I have to say our seats were phenomenal.

I don't really want to give out too much about the show for those who haven't seen it.

Please go see this show. I will leave it at that.. The best Steak on the Strip everything considered.
Sides included and great service.. A 4.5 star review rounded up to 5 stars.

This place is really quite deceiving.

I was admittedly skeptical of this place. When I first looked at the menu, some of the flavor combinations were similar to that found in fine dining places. The prices, however, were not quite that of fine dining.

The strip-mall like entrance did not help my initial perception of this establishment.

But once you're in, you are greeted with a decor that is truly contemporary. The wait staff members are all sharply dressed, but since it's Vegas, casual attire is always accepted. 

I don't remember what we ordered exactly as it's been a few months. I do remember that the flavors are truly done well here. I've always thought that a dish is cooked or prepared properly if you can properly dissect the flavors. For the most part, this place indeed succeeds in that respect.

There are a few misses in terms of the ingredient combinations. I remember trying a roll whose flavors didn't quite jive. However, the raw fish in their rolls is very fresh, so if a given piece of a roll as a whole does not fit your taste buds, you can always eat the components separately and still be rewarded with fresh ingredients. The same freshness can be had with their warm dishes as well.

In terms of portions, the individual dishes can be best described as super-sized tapas that can easily be shared between two or perhaps three people. 

My friend and I paid $50 per person not including drinks but including gratuity. We ordered at least seven dishes and were very stuffed. For food of this caliber, it was well worth it.

My next trip to the Vegas area will definitely include a stop at this restaurant. The New York City area may have establishments similar in appearance and/or name, but I have yet to see a "Modern Japanese" restaurant in the NYC area that is as true to its name as Yonaka is.. Good beer selection, good food (I especially like the sliders, though the Caesar salad is another favorite, as is the fish & chips). Service is very good, prompt, friendly, and the manager typically comes by to see how you're doing. The prices are very reasonable as well.

Their patio is great place to have a beer after work on a nice day, and the bar has a lot of sports action if you're into that, and it has a lot of seating. We've had five coworkers in a booth before and it's super comfortable.

If you're a neo-con who likes to yell about politics in a restaurant because you don't understand how the first amendment works, then it's likely not the place for you. For anyone who merely wants to go to a bar & grill for dinner, a beer, watching the game, a quick lunch or, you know, pretty much anything one would normally go to a neighborhood bar & grill for, you likely won't be disappointed. A big plus is that the possibility of being assaulted by political ranting is vastly smaller now than it was a few days ago.. 4 stars because it's what I expected for a 50 dollar hotel room. It was clean and quiet and had what I needed. TV and a refrigerator. I was going to stay at the hotel next door before I saw this one for 100 dollars less. They look the same and this one had better reviews. Only negative is the front desk girl. She has a really bad attitude. She is the super skinny chick with a ugly tattoo on her chest that says believe. But for 50 bucks I dealt with it. If you are going to stay in the Glendale-phoenix area and are looking for a decent room that's inexpensive this is it.  It's a 5 to 10 minute drive from the University of Phoenix stadium. All others are over 150 bucks.. Good food.
Great drinks.
Terrific atmosphere.

Casual upscale foodie hangout.. I love this airport, once of the easiest in the country. The restaurants are much improved and has made life so much more convenient. However, their service offerings and shops aren't so great in my opinion.. Good wine at good prices. Pork tenderloin was excellent. Ribbon pasta w/ sausage was spicy but great if you're into that. Definitely worth a visit. Good mix of people, from 20s to 60s....casually laid back.. This was hands-down the best experience I've ever had with a plumber: if Yelp had 6 stars, I'd give it.
The wife and I woke up, went through our morning routine, and wound up with not one but TWO flooded bathrooms. It turns out that we had two problems: a clogged pipe to the street flooded one toilet, and the other had a broken wax seal that leaked out onto the floor. Freddy showed up in less than an hour, was friendly and talked me through our problems, had everything he needed to get the job done, and offered a very reasonable price for the fix. The whole time he worked he walked me through everything he was doing. I came away feeling like I learned something from the experience, so it wasn't just a chore.
I called a couple other plumbers, and I was told that it would be $40 just to show up and the that they couldn't come until the next day. They need to realize that Freddy's Plumbing is the way service should be.. Valhalla has become our go-to bar in uptown Charlotte. Great and seasonally changing beer list, a good by-the-glass wine list and surprisingly terrific food. The indoor space is fun and exactly what a bar should be--the outdoor seating along Brevard court is awesome. But the best part is the staff; knowledgable, helpful, and after just a couple of visits are likely to know your name and drink. On game days the place is crazy but the staff maintains their equanimity and gets your drink out to you as soon as humanly possible. Love this place!. I was recently married here in November. I met with Tony and the staff back in January. My fiance (now wife), and I wanted something all inclusive, but in Vegas, because well... it's Vegas!

During my wedding venue scouting trip in Vegas I quickly found out that we could have a $25k+ all inclusive wedding/reception on the strip, which would last about 2 hours, have a "drive-thru" wedding (No thanks), or option 3 have Sunset Gardens take care of just about everything and provide a 4.5 hour wedding/reception.

I was skeptical when I first met Tony. He was so confident, I assumed there would be a catch at the end of his presentation; this was not the case. After Tony showed me around, he took me in to his office, and he started going over what would be included, along with pricing. What he quoted me seemed too good to be true. -A back story, I'm from California, where Weddings are usually 20k+ for something like this- I asked Tony for a straight answer, and that I wanted to know if there was any catch, or additional fees, surcharges, etc. Listed on the pricing sheet Tony pointed out a 5% charge, which covered cleanup, tips, and miscellaneous expenses. 
I thought to myself 5%?, that's nothing! And truth be told that was the only fee that you may or may not consider extra (I didn't).

The wedding it'self was wonderful. Our guests could not stop raving about how private and stunning the venue was. The reception offered delicious food, great music from DJ Syd, who was included, photos, a video, and endless liquor. My groomsmen were not disappointed!

I highly recommend Sunset Gardens for any event, but especially weddings. Tony, the office staff, and the reception staff really go above and beyond to cater to every need.
Thank you Sunset Gardens Team for a wonderful experience!

*Also, know your football! Tony is a huge Chargers fan. He asked me my team, and I told him it was The Chargers knowing little to nothing about the team. Lets just say one of us spoke a lot about the team and season, while the other person did a lot of smiling and nodding.. Real comfortable beds... And great location.. You know how Subway has a big selection of things to put onto your sandwich... this place does that... with pizza toppings! Choose a size personal, "MOD" (medium) or large. The 6" personal was less than $5. The medium was just under $8 and the large was just under $10. You can completely customize your pizza with as many different toppings as you choose... and the price does not change! It is quick and the crust is thin and crispy (not everyone likes thin crust... but personally it's my favorite). Good selection of fountain drinks, iced tea, lemonade (regular or blackberry) and beers. This is my new favorite pizza place... hands down!. More than just WINGS! This place has fantastic chicken teriyaki bowls too! The flavor of the spicy teriyaki has the perfect amount of heat and the vegetables are fresh.. I went here with a group of Yelpers on a taco trot UYE arranged by Nelson and Sylvia Q.  This was the first stop on our quest to try tacos at three different places.  Nelson had advised that the al pastor tacos were the best he's had and who was I to disagree when he has so much experience.

I ordered two tacos--remember, we had two more spots to go and then on for a dessert stop.  The two tacos were al pastor and cabeza.  The al pastor is pork meat, seasoned, piled onto a large carousel skewer, and then cooked as it turns.  I ordered the taco with complimentary pineapple at nelson's suggestion.  The pineapple is cubed and spread over the pork pieces.  It makes a great taste combination! 

The cabeza is shredded beef head.  When you get your tacos, there's a separate area on the side where there are all kinds of toppings--pico, cilantro, sauces of differing spiciness, diced onion, and limes.  With this, I ordered some guava juice.

The two tacos were outstanding!  We stood around in the small area eating our delights and having good conversation and lots of laughs.  This is a must do again!  What a great place with such pleasant people working here.  At $2 per taco and $1 per drink, it's a very good deal.  Round 1 of our taco trek was complete!. This is simply one of my favorite spots in town. They say that consistency is the hallmark of excellence. Well I've been stuffing my face with their delicious gyros and assorted fried side dishes since high school, and I've yet to eat one that wasn't just totally fulfilling and delicious.  Actually, the hallmark of excellence is probably just making really fantastic gyros, which is a thing that Zorba's is all about. The staff is always friendly, and even at their busiest you're going to get your order quickly.

My go to order has generally been the large chicken, however you can't go wrong with the classic. You can take either and pick a size to fit your small-large appetite, and then customize it from there, which is a little different, and better, than most other gyro joints I've visited. I also prefer subbing in onion rings or fried mushrooms for fries.
The location is a little small, so it can get packed during the lunch hour, but even so there is usually a table open, or you can easily get your meal to go.

If you find yourself on campus and don't check this place out, you're doing yourself an enormous disservice.. Love the Beatles...  Loved the show.. Good sushi, pricey.. I can't believe it took me so long to review this place. The pizza here is ON POINT. The only better pizza in my opinion is Pomo. This place is so close to being #1 in the state but Pomo still barely takes the cake. I'd like to think I'm a little bit of a pizza connoisseur at this point. Yes, I had to look up how to spell that. The dessert was delicious as well. Pay attention because you may miss this place. It is hard to find on the side of the street but it doesn't matter. This place can easily survive off of word of mouth solely. I just wish it wasn't so far from where I live. They definitely should expand locations like Pomo. The ambiance is great. It is a little darker and quiet which is nice. The servers are friendly and seem passionate about their job. The prices are in line with all of their competitors. I would highly recommend trying this place. I will definitely be coming back.. spent 4 days at this hotel in mid october. very pleasant stay in one of their corner suites which are have a very nice lay out with 2 bathrooms. i found the technology in the room to be bothersome. perhaps if i were an invalid hospital patient the bedside controls for the entire suite would be handy but i really don't mind flipping a light switch manually. (that's just me) all of the staff members were excellent, very professional and polite. i was turned off by the gaming area. it's very dark. the location leaves something to be desired. it's a bit of a hike to get down to the strip from the hotel entrance. the tram that connects the monte carlo, aria/vdara and the bellegio is mildly helpful. i would give the room and service staff 5 stars and the property and design 3 stars.. The best coffee in Las Vegas. The staff is knowledgable on the products and incredibly kind. 

Beyond, the coffee this is a great place to meet with people or get away and work using their free wi-fi. 

The coffee is slightly more expensive than other coffee shops in the area, but the quality of the coffee makes it worth it.. This was a recommendation from one of my coworkers and I decided we would stop in there after work the other day and get dinner... 

First thing is first, the building is not the prettiest of places but i guess it fits the overall feel of the place, you walk in and 2 young ladies dressed in old Mexican dress great you and get you seated, the waiter then came by to see us and offer us drinks.. Let me stop and say that the waiter was extremely friendly and on top of every aspect of our meal. We ordered a Margarita and waters with the Table side Guacamole for an appetizer. this was probably the best guacamole i gave ever had. The meal also comes with not only your entree but you get sopa de fideo with every combo plus beans and rice, My grandma used to make sopa de fideo before she passed and it tasted just like her.  memories!!!  

Okay so now that my review has turned into one long run on sentence I will just finish by saying the meals are huge, tasty and fairly priced, I definitely recommend this place if you like Mexican food and great service.. Great variety and well worth the $50 dollars.
I would say it's on par with Wicken Spoon.  It actually might be better due to their fresh oyster bar and hot/cold king crab/snow crab selection.
I was impressed with their noodle section, serving both ramen and pho. 
Try to go therearound 3:30pm to avoid huge lines.
Also, ask for the tables in the back, noticed how spacious it was compared to the other dining area.  Enjoy!. My wife and I had been to the North Scottsdale location many times and were worried that the Chandler location wouldn't be up to par.  The food was just as amazing and the service was better than the Scottsdale location.  And I didn't have to pay for valet parking (I wish the other location would fix that).  People of Chandler, you finally have a restaurant worth going to, so just suck it up and pay a little more or you won't get another.. This was a great experience from start to finish! You would think a one hour bus ride from the strip to Pahrump would be boring, but you'd be wrong! They get the wine sampling started early by doing a blind taste test on the bus, as well as keeping the guests occupied with plenty of information about the history of both Las Vegas and Pahrump. Our tour guide, Mikko, was very knowledgeable and kept things fun.

The wineries are interesting and it was cool to see that certain types of grapes can thrive here in Southern Nevada. We got to taste over 20 wines throughout the entire day, most of which were delicious! Lunch at Symphony's was also delicious -- I got the French dip sandwich and steak fries, both of which were of great quality.

Both winemakers were knowledgeable and hospitable. The second winemaker, Jack Sanders, is just a blast with his witty humor.

By the end of the day, you will most likely be a little "wined out" - 20+ samples is no joke... But if you have a free Saturday or Sunday and need an excellent date idea, or just a fun way to spend the day with a wine-loving family member, I strongly recommend Imbibe Tours!. I can't break my addiction to this place.

The fish was as good as ever but not quite the same as a few months ago. I didn't get one large piece, I got one piece and scraps to make up on the scale what they feel is "large." But they were cooked separately so the little piece was much more greasy than the rest.

The "chips" still suck.

I had two friends with me. One had the small fish and chips and one had the salad and half sandwich. Both were pleased with their meals... both said that they would go back... so that's a plus!

But I wanted more. The fish is good to great but everything else is meh.. I had my rear tires replaced here because they were getting pretty worn down.  I've had good experiences with Discount Tire in the past and this store was no exception. The staff was very friendly and got to me right away. 

About halfway through the installation a mechanic came out and had me accompany him to the work area. He showed me that one of my wheels was bent but did it in a way that didn't feel like he was "pushing" more repairs on me. The front desk staff helped me pick a good replacement wheel and since they didn't have it in stock they told me they would order it. They were even nice enough to discount the new wheel and installation because they didn't have the match in their inventory.

I would highly recommend this place.  I'd also suggest you make a reservation over the phone so that they can get to you immediately.. Having been to Vegas several times I finally went to see this show and I'm glad I did. It was fantastic! 

The food was pretty darn tasty. The tomato soup they start you with was excellent and the main course was just as good. The cornish game hen was perfectly seasoned and very moist. As were the potatoes and the broccoli (which had parmesan cheese sprinkled on it. Mmmmm). It also comes with a biscuit, which is, well... a biscuit. You've had one, you've had them all. Dessert consists of an apple strudel type pastry that was surprisingly good.  Of course the whole schtick of eating without utensils just adds to the fun. Don't worry though, they include a napkin and a large wet nap with your meal.

The show was excellent and while obviously heavily choreographed, the fighting and jousting was fun to watch. We sat in the Dragon section and therefore rooted for the bad guy which was fun too! The special effects and pyrotechnics were great, especially the evil wizards flame throwing staff. You could feel the heat from that thing  sitting in the stands!

I'm giving this show 5 stars. Its well worth seeing at least once and a great choice if you want to take the kids.

One word of advice though: PARTICIPATE!!!  Don't be shy! Slap the table with your hands, cheer for your sections knight and boo the opposing knights as they ride by on a horse (they'll point at you and give you the neck slice gesture!)  Do that and you'll have a lot more fun!. Wow.... I didn't realize what a great deal this was.  It is mch easier and cheaper to get to downtown from the South strip than the more expensive Downtown/Strip Express bus. The WAC is only $2 vs. the multiple stopping RTC at $5 vs. taxi for about $20.  The WAC picks up right next to the NY/NY on Tropicana Blvd going west.  It then gets on the freeway and heads downtown... and stops along the way by the courthouse and other buildings before dropping you a block from Fremont.  Definitely worth it.  Pickup your return trip in front of Binions.  Have fun.. I've been to almost all of the buffets at the big strip hotels, and paid over 70 bucks for some of them.  I wasn't planning on partaking in the GN buffet because of the poor yelp reviews. But I did out of hunger and convenance. I was pleasantly surprised. The food was just as good or better than others I've paid much more for. It was a great selection and everything I tried was fresh and at the appropriate temperature. Our server was an older gentleman named Frank. He was awesome. Very friendly, accommodating and funny. After our meal there we were sorry we didn't eat there more often. The only thing I wish the golden nugget would bring back is the steak and eggs midnight buffet. I remember years ago they offered that. It was always a full house and delicious.. Was not sure after seeing the mixed reviews, but it is always good to make up your own mind. My GF and I went last night (Xmas eve) and the staff was amazing! They were all super friendly and accommodating. We got the Mongolian Beef and Volcano Chicken (both with Lo Mein noodles). Both dishes came out quickly and were delicious! The meats were tender and cooked just right, The veges were very fresh and not over cooked. with a bit of crunch 

The table across from us had ordered the Sizzling Hot Beef Plate that was reviewed earlier. It might have been a dud that time, it was a winner this time. The metal plate was so hot you could smell the wooden holder underneath it (kind of like summer camp craft class). When the server put the beef on the hot plate, it was like a fourth of July Fajita! It sizzled like crazy and then went up in flames when the server poured the Ginger wine on it. Very impressive and the people said it was great. 

We will deff go back for that and the rest of the menu.. This is going to be crude so if you are easily offended please move on to the next review
Are you sure you want to continue?
Really, this is pretty nasty?
OK but do not blame me when you cannot remove this visual from your mind for the next few weeks,
I ate so much red meat here I think I produced a hamburger the next morning! 
Damn it was good, most brazilian Churrascarias you can get your meat Medium, Medium Well, or Well done, here they actually had some that were everything from Rare to Well done depending on the cut and whether they gave you a middle section outside or just inside,etc and they were all delicious. The selection was great, and I have yet to mention the salad bar which was absolutely spectacular if I had just the salad bar this place would get 4 stars add back in the perfectly cooked meats and Wow!. I don't understand all the poor reviews.  First off, do we really need to give a place bad marks if you don't like the art work?  If we want to go that route, the Common House has a beautiful old-style bar that brings up images of the 20s. But I digress.

The food here is above average.  The pimento cheese fries (topped with bacon) are a great change from the overdone bar food variety.  The food is flavorful and the burgers tasty.  There are also several vegetarian options on the menu.

The big thing that keeps me coming back here are the drink specials and great selection on tap.  There are enough options on tap to keep any beer lover happy.. I really enjoy this place.  The crowd is lively with a good mix of people from twenty something and older singles out to eat and drink along with couples through their 70s to go with business people out for lunch, dinner or just drinks after work. The good music and unique decor are nice touches as it seems the owners have worked hard to build a fun yet classy atmosphere.

The menu is excellent (lunch and dinner) with strong wine and beer selections (including many local ones). The meat and cheese board and the various bruschetta selections are excellent for starters.  The flatbread selections are also very good. 

The entrees are excellent with a variety of tasty selections but I favor the simple ones -- the chicken pannini and cheeseburger. That cheeseburger is ridiculously good. 

The service has been good each time but getting better as the staff seems to be settling in. The owners stopped by the table on our latest visit and seem to be taking a great interest in their establishment. Well done -- we will be back again soon.. I eat here at least once every 2 weeks. Food is AMAZING and always a great menu with different options. Smoothies are ok, but you can substitute that with their very cold and refreshing cucumber water. ;) I highly recommend their Happymess. BOMB.com!!!! Wish that this location was a little bigger being that it's always packed with limited sitting. Other than that, GREAT FOOD AND EXPERIENCE. Stay Skinny while thinking Fat.. This is a place you would not normally stop at as it's hidden away in the corner of a small strip in a less desirable part of Phoenix.......yet the food is out of this world!!  The started the meal off with this amazing bruschetta and the meals we ordered reminded me of a good italian meal from where I used to live in New Jersey.  I am so glad to have found this place.. I decided to shave my head for the first time, so I did some internet research and found The Art of Shaving in the Scottsdale Fashion Mall.  Yes it is pricey ($90 including tip for head shave and royal goatee shave), but I was willing to pop at least once for what appeared to be the best, and Erick, their master barber, filled the bill.  I spent an hour in the chair with Erick shaving every surface of my head twice, trimming nearly every follicle individually to shape a perfect goatee, the best it has ever looked.  The "royal" treatment also included a mud facial, rose water eye pads, kind of embarrassing to do with my girlfriend watching, but my skin has never looked better.   Prior to going in, I had just let my hair and beard grow into mountain-man mode, and I knew I wanted it groomed differently, but wasn't really sure what I wanted.  Other barbers when faced with mountain man have never really been confident enough to create a look, and I am not one to look through magazines trying to identify the perfect goatee for me.   I was glad to find someone (a "master" barber wearing a black tie) who knew exactly what to do, and in the end, he left my goatee longer and well shaped, which I really liked.. I went during a quiet time with my boys. I have never had New York pizza before all I knew was that it was thin crust. We ordered the garlic cheese knots and my boys loved it and I thought it was good. We ordered the large works pizza and the wait was less than expected. My boys filled up on garlic cheese knots and my wife was at work so it was up to me to be the taste tester. In the spirit of full disclosure I do not like thin crust pizza, it started because I do no like how greasy they are. The pizza was nice though, it wasnt greasy at all. The ingredients were fresh, I really enjoyed that. The employees were helpful and friendly.  I apologize to the waitress because I forgot your name. You were great. One of my kids was getting antsy and the waitress did I great job distracting them. The 4th star was given by my wife who ate the leftovers, she loved it. If the cost was less it would be getting 5 stars.. Went there today hoping they were open to public but alas not till the 29th. Gave my wife and I a complimentary ice tea though. Tea was quality! Can't wait for the food. Place looked great!. I had a craving for bakery cookies (isn't that how all good adventures start?). Not donuts, not frou-frou cupcakes... cookies.  Specifically those melt-in-your-mouth, sprinkle-topped butter cookies that go down so nice & easy they quickly leave only memories and off-yellow crumbs behind. I could have retreated to my local neighborhood grocery store, but I knew that would be an unsatisfying cop-out.  Even though my course of business lead me to an unfamiliar stretch of town, I was sure somewhere close there had to be a mom-and-pop bake shop that could quench my cookie thirst.  

Armed with my trusty iPhone and Yelp app, I was quickly informed that just out of sight from my current location, in a typical nondescript Vegas strip mall, there existed such an oasis.  The irony with the corner of Flamingo and Maryland is that there is so much happening and you can't make legitimate heads or tails of any of it.  Each corner hosts its own crowded characterless shopping center, but it was on the Southeast corner (the one with the Buffalo Exchange,) that I would find Bakery Magic, right behind the Nevada State Bank where a previous reviewer said I would.  

Inside there were 2 smiling shop-keeps ensconced by every variety of baked good one could ever desire.  The staff, recognizing me as a newbie, offered me a few samples (cake and cookies and candy, oh my!), explained the shop was fairly new, and handed me a specialty cake menu so thorough it made me want to fake it was my birthday just to have an excuse to order one.  I went in assuming they'd have Black 'N Whites, which they did, and had them assemble me a half-pound of assorted butter cookies ($12.00/lb).  As with any good bakery they told me they went over a half-pound but wouldn't hit me up for the difference.  

Despite my limited sampling I'm confident recommending this shop for those in & around the University area looking for a sweet fix.  While I'm not sure I would cross town for them for anything short of a "special occasion" cake or treat, I know that if I find myself on their corner again I'd have to fight a pretty mean urge to resist returning for another round of Bakery Magic.. I have to totally DISAGREE with the last review!! We were having issues with a Chevy Colorado we bought and took to this Aamco to be diagnosed after not being able to get the get codes off the vehicle. Aamco took the truck in, tore it apart and found a wiring harness that was disconnected and evidence that the vehicle had been tampered with!! They had the truck for a day and a half and even provided us with documentation for the loan company. They were not able to get the trucks main module to connect with their diagnostic computer and that was why they went through it with a fine tooth comb to find out why. Because the wiring harness and wires were disconnected the module burned out and the truck wouldn't run properly. We found out that it would have cost a small fortune to fix and Aamco did all this for only $100!!! They saved us probably a couple thousand in repairs!!

We have since been back for oil changes and have bought a new (used) vehicle in which we are going to have them look over for us. They are very nice and seem knowledgeable. No bad "vibes" here! They didn't try to sell us anything and only did what we wanted everytime we go in. 

My only complaint would be that they didn't update us and when we called them they had closed (this was a Sat) early and they didn't call to tell us they had to keep the truck. We called them Sunday to learn the truck was ready.

We will continue to use Aamco, at least for oil changes and inspections!!. Matt is extremely knowledgeable and great at what he does. He is great on both the selling and buying side of the trade. Strongly recommend. Finally made it to Pete's last night and found myself some very good Pad Thai.  The portions were huge and the food was fresh and delicious.  When the food is this good the service is not a great concern to me. However if the service is also good that is just added incentive.  The service was also very good.  Took maybe a tad long to get our food to the table but it was worth it.  Can't wait to go back and try a rice dish.. Love the wings - tried several of the hotter flavors.. The Wynn ROCKS!!  We just spent the last couple of nights here and it is NOW our new "go to" hotel in Vegas.  Awesome pool, awesome golf course, extremely spacious.  Two things that bug the crap out of me in Vegas are bad ventilation and sardine cramped hotels.  At  the Wynn, I never really smelled smoke and didn't feel claustrophobic at all.  Overall, the facilities are first rate.  Floor to ceiling windows, flat screens in the bedroom and bathroom, a nice big tub to relax in...Just an overall great experience.  We can't wait to come back.... I've never had a problem here. I will receive coupons through the mail once in awhile but if there are none available I come here anyways. The stylists are friendly and are very accommodating.

The inside is always kept clean and they don't force their products on you. I do like the fact that they keep a record of the cut you normally get but just make sure to remember it cause if you go to another location they will not have it in the system. Not much more to say but try it out for yourself if you happen to be in the area.. What a lovely little cafe. Overshadowed by big sibling cafe Nevé, this delightful little space is spartan enough and serves some phenomenal coffee. Today they were serving Anchored, Cut, or Pig Iron beans. I went with a cut cortado and to date this has been the best cortado that I've ever had. Thankfully I showed up immediately after the patisseries arrived so I got to enjoy a still warm croissant to the Beach Boys, which the barista was subtlely humming along to all thea relaxing while.

Easily the best cafe in the plateau/mile end for relaxing little coffee and newspaper reading on a Sunday morning.. Dear married men.

This is the place where they sell Get Out of Jail gifts. This place yes sells mens shoes, from running shoes, work shoes, dress shoes and are all pretty in expensive and have most sizes.

I can't tell you how many times I have either had to many beers at a work function, forgot  important dates or even meant one thing but blurted out something completely different.(I'm a catch that's for sure)

This place has every style of woman's shoe that you did or didn't know even knew they made.... Staff is pretty good and the place is clean.


In summary

Woman: This place is a wonderland for you, throw a few hours aside and please don't get to overwhelmed!!!

Men: You can buy shoes here. Happy Hour is the best time to visit and is the best value. Don't miss the "Big Ass" burger or green chili pork. Get there before the 4pm start of happy hour to ensure you get a seat. There's often a line out the door!. Asian Buffet in the old Claim Jumper location around Shea and Scottsdale Road.

Good selection of sushi and Tempura. Depends when you go how fresh the sushi is. Go when it is busy and the sushi is fresh because of the turnover.

The meat area is very good with prime rib, chinese bbq ribs and sausage. Prime rib was actually juicy and very well prepared considered it is a buffet. Chinese bbq ribs are well prepared and very authentic.

There is a selection of shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs don't look like high quality.

There are of course the usual fried rice, chow mein, mayo shrimp, Chicken teriyaki along with an array of desserts and ice cream.

My favorite is the salt and pepper shrimp with the head. You have to tear off the head and eat the shrimp with the shell and legs where all the flavor is at.

Beverages are not included.

Overall pretty good food and will be back again.. A bit out of our way, but worth the drive. We were a party of 4. We had reservations and were seated quickly. We all shared the stuffed mushrooms as our appetizer. Quite good and the single order was just right for the four of us. Drinks before dinner were also very good. I had a dirty martini, while my date had a Lemmon Tini. All main dishes were good and we split a wedge salad. Dressing was blue cheese. Recommended! Tiera Masu excellent, but still frozen on top.. Loud, lively and wonderful.  The best sushi in Charlotte!. Review for show date 7/5/2010

Wow this guy is a true entertainer!  The show was well worth the ticket price. We paid approximately $60 for VIP seating on an internet website, but I agree with previous reviews that any seat in the house would have been a good seat.

So back to Carrot top, the guy is just a genius.  Props were extremely funny and many of them were current.  Aside from the props, his stand-up is also very good and his timing is superb.  His jokes are somewhat crude and he does poke fun at many different sterotypes, but somehow he seems justified because he also pokes fun at himself.  He seems very sincere and likable so I was never offended by any of his shtick.  Although much of his routine is adult natured, I would have felt comfortable taking my 15 year old son.  

Some reviews say his routine has been the same for many years, but I would have to disagree because I know a lot of his material in this particular show I saw was improptu.  We had a special guest in the audience....Cris Angel...he was literally 3 rows away from my wife and I.  Several times during the show, Carrot Top and Cris Angel had dialogue which was often very funny.

Anyways, both my wife and I were thoroughly satisfied with this show.  I think the only thing that could have made it better was if he came out after the show to greet the audience.  I would have loved to have shaken his hand and thanked him for the side-splitting laughs.

Thank you Carrot Top.. The best soul food in Las Vegas.  Been here a couple of times. Friendly staff. Fabulous hot water corn bread and beans and rice. Red Snapper is tasty both grilled 
and fried. Three sides with your entree is more than generous. We will definitely be going back again!. I had a good dining experience at Wine 5 Cafe. I entered the restaurant during a weekday around lunchtime. I was very impressed by the decor; the flower arrangements, statues, and colors were something I had never seen before, but it was nothing overwhelming.

I was seated quickly in an empty dining room. I believe I asked the waiter what was "good", or popular, on the menu. She suggested one of the heartier burgers and a side of vegetable logs. I agreed to order what she suggested. The burger came with a good time frame. It was a very juicy burger, but was not anything I thought was particularly special. The vegetable logs, which were various vegetables battered and fried, were pretty tasty but a bit oily.

This was the first time I was served African style food. It left me with an impression of satisfaction; I did leave with a full belly. There is a vast menu, ranging from tacos to seafood entrees. I guess I have only scratched the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Nairobi cuisine. Stop by to Wine 5 Cafe for a taste of Africa.. Solid option to grab a healthy meal in Downtown Scottsdale. I ordered the kale caesar and added avocado and red onion. It wasn't spectacular but it definitely got the job done. They have a huge variety of juices and smoothies, but I went with a tasty blackberry iced tea to go with my salad. The salad portions definitely aren't huge but I'd expect that give the salad prices are all under $10. 

I would like to come back here to try some of the other salads on the menu.. I'm so sorry that I  posted this review on the wrong location before.  I wanted to make it right, so here we go again...

I have been a customer of Salon D' Shayn  for a over a year now.   Bret always cuts my hair, and is a genius with a men's cut.   If you are looking for a great hair stylist with true talent then you need to make your next appointment with Bret.  You will walk out looking Fabulous!. Broke down and they were honest and straight forward and showed me what broke in my car. I recommend them highly.. I've been in this CVS multiple times and never had a problem with anyone. The staff at the pharmacy has always been quick and efficient when filling my meds, which is the main reason I come to this location.. Earnest, friendly outpost for wine, appetizers, a light meal, or a meal-to-go. The organic and biodynamic wines can be quite excellent, and simple appetizers like salads, soups, and bread and cheese, will get you in the mood for a more substantial meal elsewhere.

I've not tried the takeout, but it's been an enjoyable place to have drinks before dinner.. This is such a great spot for lunch.  I love that you can eat outside on the picnic tables and the coffee shop next store is the perfect compliment.. "Khristen was very friendly and made aborting layover into a tasty and fun treat. Only problem is there isn't one in Columbus, OH. Great place.". My friend can't recommend Verona Service any more highly. Always tells you exactly what is wrong with your vehicle, cost of parts, cost of labor, and asks you how you want to proceed. Keeping my friend's 2001 Pontiac Grand Am alive and well now that it is no longer leaking oil! :)
Shamelessly plagarized off said friend's facebook page.. Cool place. Were not sure they were open from outside but they are. Nice ppl. Great fresh scones baked on site.. I came here for lunch with my family.  I must say I really enjoyed this place.  I didn't expect to wait for seating midday Saturday, but there was about a 20 minute wait.  We ended up getting a table on the outside patio with a straightshot view to the Bellagio water fountain.  There were trees in our view, but we still got to experience 3 or 4 water shows.  

Beyond the location and environment, the food was quite good.  The first thing to note is the bread.  Fresh baguettes from the oven, properly made and served with a crisp crust and soft inside (baguettes aren't supposed to be rock hard).  We started with a dozen oysters (blue points, i think).  My parents have never had "real" raw oysters, having most of their experiences from AYCE asian buffets.  They were very impressed at the freshness and quality of these oysters.  Objectively, they were very fresh and tasty.  I couldn't figure out how a restaurant in the middle of the desert could have such a ready supply of fresh oysters, but nothing about the flavor or odor suggested that they weren't top notch quality.  For our main dish, our table had the chicken crepe, seafood crepe, roast beef sandwich, and the halibut.  Just about everything was good, but I especially liked the seafood crepe.  Large sea scallops adorned on a shrimp and fish crepe.

All in all, it wasn't super pricey, the food was great, and the environment was fun and refreshing.  I would definitely return.. Sooo yuuumy.  Have to order the simmer fried beef and tendon noodle soup.  So yuuuummmyyyy. So gooood. It feels like real taiwanese food vendor shop.. I love the vig and the laidback but highclass atmosphere they present there. The breakfast in manhattan martini doesn't play around, it has woodford reserve bourbon shaken with fresh apple juice and syrup! It has shredded bacon lining the rim of this intoxicating drink. The only reason I gave them a 4 is because I ordered my steak Med-Rare and it came out Medium and even more dry than a medium should be.. With the crazy electrical storms the past few days my AC unit exploded, yes really.  I wasn't sure what to do so from a recommendation from my sister I filled out the web form for Accurate Air on their website ( it was late when the explosion happened ). Their office staff called me promptly when they opened  in the morning and were very nice and sent George out right away.  George came and surveyed the damage and gave me a few options on repairing or replacing the exploded compressor.  I opted for a new AC unit.  They got one from the warehouse and had it installed the new morning in the morning all in about 24 hours.  I had really good luck with them.. This place is great.  If you're just visiting Vegas and you're looking for some authentic northeastern Chinese food, this is definitely a place worth checking out. It's still relatively new but the food tasted amazing and authentic.  Also the staff was very friendly.  We ordered beef dumplings and they even hand-made the Chinese yellow wasabi at our request.  Definitely coming back here again when I'm in town.. Solid 4 star rating, very consistent which is a trait high on my radar.

This "is" New Mexican cuisine, which translates to hatch pepper green sauce and sopapillas. After that the sky is the limit with variations and combinations of cooking styles. 

And vary it does!

At Carlsbad there are 3 distinct dining areas, The Bar, The Cave, The Grotto. Each area presents a completely different atmosphere and draws corresponding cliental. 

Casual fine dining in "The Cave". 

Trendy down in "The Grotto".

 You will find the regulars in "The Bar".

I prefer eating "fine dining food" at the bar, because that's how I roll. The bar tenders are witty and quick with a joke and light up your smoke if you know what I mean? The drink strengths vary by the bartenders. 

Its very dark and low key and you will drive right by the entrance if you are not careful. Carlsbad is also one of the few places in town that serve late night food. You have to try this place out for yourself, nothing else like it in the valley. 

My kind of place!. Formerly "RigaTony's", the place still retains pretty much the same feel inside. Dropped by here on Saturday with my kids and we all enjoyed an Italian feast. The house salad and bread (served with any entrée) is fantastic! This is good quality Italian food, a step above Olive Garden.

The portions are generous, service is good, and the prices are fair.. This place has fast become a favorite of mine.  They have a great Happy Hour, with $5 small plates that are very generously portioned.  The presentation of everything here is impressive and service is consistently excellent. 
The flatbreads are very popular and provide some great combinations, I like the steak and blue cheese flatbread which is easily a meal.
Save room for dessert, the mini desserts they present and explain are amazing, every one my guests or I have tried has been scrumptious.
I look forward to my next dinner there.. [Brian's take on star ratings (restaurants): 5 - I'd request my last meal from here and service was spectacular, 4 - A shortcoming or two but still fabulous, 3 - Not my cup of tea but definitely may be someone else's, 2 - I would not return here, 1 - Not only was the food bad but the service was poor.] 

Let's just get this out of the way: the only reason this place doesn't get my 5 stars is because of the HUGE disparity between Happy Hour prices & not. Dear God.

I ate here for dinner after a particularly terrible check-in to the MGM Grand (1 star review pending) & was already in a foul mood. However, all was forgiven after my first bite. The food here is divine. I don't remember specifics because of de facto Vegas inebriation having kicked in by meal time, but the 4 main dishes we ordered were amazing. The staff is phenomenal (thanks to Tina for complimenting my fiance's engagement ring multiple times!), the food was cooked perfectly, & nary a soul at my table had anything bad to say. If you've read my other reviews, you know I'm a seafood lover, & this place delivers the goods. Tab was around $340 for 4 people, including drinks and ton o' oysters.

THEN, we ate there again later that weekend for Happy Hour. Holy sheesh, hello $120 bill despite ordering more oysters/drinks/food. Fine, restaurants have Happy Hour for a reason, but a $220 difference? Yowza.

Don't let that deter you from eating here at any time of day though. Food was definitely worth every penny in both scenarios. I've never heard of Michael Mina but damned if I wouldn't high-5 him if I ever met him.. I love this place. After moving from Chicago to Vegas about 8 years ago my family had been looking for a good Chicago eatery and we found it here. 

It's sorta a whole in the wall but is actually a lot bigger then it looks. Lots of seating, never had a problem with seating even with 7 or 8 people. Lots of really awesome Chicago stuff on the walls.....except all the stupid Cubs stuff. 

The menu is really good. Good size, easy to understand, and has lots of choices. I really like the Italian beef sandwich. Wet. With cheese. The roll they use is really good and doesn't fall apart till the last bite. The meat is always on point and they give you a lot. The fries that come with it, they have more to be desired. They are okay but could be better. I've also had the original Chicago Dog! It's really good, sesame seed bun, green relish, pickle spear, tomatoes. The whole package. I really really really really really like that they have Green River soda and Jays brand chips. The prices aren't bad but could be a little bit cheaper. Staff is always nice and friendly. The one weird thing is sometimes they have these specials where if your name is Tom for example they give you a free hot dog. Or if you have a birthday that month they will give you a free drink. Haha I've never had it happen to me but it sounds good! 

If you are from Chicago or like Chicago food and are looking for something authentic I'd definitely suggest this place!. I have used Chiropractors off and on for over 20 years. For me personally I have found acupuncture to be a better pain solution. I was a skeptic of acupuncture, mostly because I didn't know much about it. I have since come to be a big believer in the practice. The pain still returns, but I get longer periods of relief than I did using Chiropractors. I also sit at a desk hunched over a computer all day, so the pain in my neck and upper back is bound to come back from time to time. The last time I was in, I complained of some minor pain in my hip. Like a ninja she inserted a couple of needles into the area and within 48 hours the pain was gone. It had been bothering me for 4 weeks. I have been going to see Dr. Richman for about 6 months now. She runs a great practice. I show up on time, I am treated on time. What a concept? The pricing is extremely fair and she also gave me some exercise tips to strengthen the muscles in the back. I am very pleased with the service, bed side manner and overall treatment I receive from Acupuncture Vegas. My next step is to show her a list of my cabinet full of western supplements. Albeit a scary thought I have a feeling I will be saying goodbye to many of them.. If you are a sushi pig like I an, this place is the spot for you! For 25 bucks, you can do the all you can eat sushi option. Honestly, it's not the best sushi I have had personally, but it is still pretty good for what you pay for. I really like the names of the sushi, very adult-oriented. The rolls are made fresh and they come out quickly. Their service is great, never an empty water glass. Any hungry sushi lover should hit this place up. Sushi snobs may want to take a pass on this. Be warned, thus place is pretty popular and there may be a wait!. One of the few wal-greens i've been too where it was cracking.

Everyone and their mothers are here for one thing. ALCOHOL. Who the hell spends hundreds of dollars to buy alcohol on the strip when you can buy a handle(s) and be boogee. I do.

Customer service is very nice and pleasant might i add. However if you are on the run and you don't wanna spend $xxx.xx amount on the strip, be smart buy a case of beers, or a handle and your favorite chaser and get plastered in the most cost efficient way on the strip. I have no shame to walk around the strip with their 2 40's or some black henny and a coke. The more the merrier!. I especially found the LIVE BIRDS living in the trees inside the dining area of interest.

Food was good and service was OK, fine I guess for a buffet.

I have been here 4 or 5 times before and will probably come again.. The kids and I stopped here for dinner and enjoyed our food.  The atmosphere was nice but a little heavy on the color mauve for my taste.  

We had paht thai, sticky rice and evil jungle noodles with tofu.  We ordered the paht thai with no spice to the kids preference and the evil jungle monkey noodles I ordered mild.  The red curry & coconut milk broth of the evil jungle monkey monkey noodles was very aromatic and flavorful.  

I found that even mild the evil jungle monkey monkey monkey noodles had a distinctive spicy hotness.  The red curry used in the evil jungle monkey monkey monkey monkey noodles continued to build in hotness as I ate, so I would keep that in mind if you order the evil jungle monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey noodles.

I would definitely recommend Thai Rama when you're in the mood for Thai.  The next visit I will try other selections from their menu, although I did find the evil jungle monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey noodles somewhat compelling.  I do find the name of the dish to be sort of odd.  What's evil about a bowl of noodles anyway?

Monkey.. This place is pretty good. Honestly, their beef wasn't that great, but that is why they lose 1 star from me.
Overall they had a lot of good stuff and their bar was great. free drinks as long as you are dining.
Im there every time i go to Vegas... which is almost every month lol. Prior to flying to the US, I'd promised myself that I would try Gordon Ramsay's Burger joint and this one as well. I did the Ramsay burger on the 3rd day and loved it so the Pub & Grill was the one remaining.

We went for dinner there on the last night of our 4 nights in Vegas and I have to say, in all honesty, that I had a great experience. Alright alright, I am a fan of Chef Ramsay but you have to give credit to where credit's due. He knows how to structure his restaurants - the layout, decor, the way that everything is setup; it works! 

Ramsay Pub & Grill has a bit of a retro/funky feel. It's not too formal but then again, it's not too casual either. Whether you're hanging out w/ friends over dinner or you're out on a date, it'll suit the occasion. 

I really like the photo of Gordon and his bulldog Rumpole on the menu - pretty funny!

I had the Shepherd's Pie and it was really good. The bread and cheesy dipping appertizers were very nice and I also had a cocktail - not bad. I really wanted dessert however I was too full - that'll be for next time!

The waitress who looked after us was very nice. 

You'll find Ramsay Pub & Grill at the entrance to the Palace Casino inside Caesars.. Check it out.... I had heard good things about Dixie,  but still was nervous about taking engagement photos,  as it's not on my list of favorite things to do.  Once my bride to be  and I met her,  we knew she was the perfect person to portray how we feel about each other.  The finished product was exceptional.  I recommend Dixie to all who need an important,  or just fun moment in their life captured with pictures.... The wife and I love to go to this place from time to time. The decor is modern and clean and the food is great. I must admit that we have only ordered a few things off of the menu but they are so good we are scared to venture to much on the menu. The fried chicken and the lamb chops are the gems of this menu. I also had one of their infused vodka martinis the last time we went and it was great. We hear that the brunch is equally amazing. Love this place.. Seems more authentic than what you get at other local restaurants. I enjoyed the tacos de asada and will come again to try the fajitas. Give em a try!. My brother, friend, and I  went in here for lunch to get some dim sum.  It was very good.  Good portions and reasonable prices.  Will definitely come here again if I'm in the area.  Highly recommended!. Let me start from the beginning here. I was searching for a good date spot for me and my gf. I have dined at most of the finer restaurants in Vegas. But I wanted to try something new and by far, this was the best reviewed spot. Only thing that turned me off was that it was in the middle of a mall. NOT AN ISSUE. I requested the 'Tree House' and that is where we were sat. Once in there I completely forgot I was in a mall...it was romantic and beautiful. Our server greeted us and asked if we've ever diner here before....we both responded "NO". We were then treated to a 5 minute explanation of their entire menu. Based on other reviews...we started with the shrimp cocktail and I suggest you do the same. Very unique and brilliant presentation. My gf had the Fillet of Arctic Char "Oreganata"..we both LOVED it. I had the Bone In Rib-Eye. Cooked perfectly. Delicious. For sides we chose the mac-n-cheese(not bad, but kinda bland to what I've had at comparable restaurants) and the brussel sprouts...fantastic. We had no room for dessert. Cocktails were good....coming from a guy in that business. As we left, EVERYONE thanked us for coming...from busser to manager. That was impressive. I even woke up the next morning to a voicemail from them thanking me for me business and hoping that me and my 'beautiful' gf had a great time; and that they hope to see us again. ONLY complaint..and this is being picky: when our bread was dropped off(with multiple choices), it was just thrown down with no explanation as to what was what. But this is a must go!. Z-Pizza (and Carlos) came through for me in a big way during a recent late night work day. I was going on my 13th hour at the office and my hunger pangs were really getting the best of me and the only thing I had in my overhead was a couple sleeves of instant oatmeal and a pack of Cup O' Noodles. I'm soo tired of oatmeal for dinner and I wasn't feeling the Cup O' Noodles either.  My office is downtown so late night delivery options are almost non-existent and being that I was on command center duty, I could not leave my post so it had to be delivery or nada.  Sad thing is, most of the eateries in my downtown nook roll up pavement between 8 and 9pm.  After calling all my favorite daytime eateries (that were still open at 9pm)which either don't offer delivery or stopped delivery at 8pm, I was just about to give up and settle for those expired sleeves of the oatmeal when I thought to give Z-Pizza a try. Sure glad I did! Technically they too were no longer delivering for the night but Carlos was so nice and said he would do it for me. I had my order in and it was delivered within 20 minutes. My salad was crisp and cold and my pasta & meatballs were piping hot. Carlos was just as friendly in person as he was on the phone and thanks to Z-Pizza I was a happy well fed man.. I love this place!  Since I've moved away from Pittsburgh a few years ago, I really miss it, too.  Haven't found something quite like it anywhere else.

First, in my opinion this place has the best restaurant style burgers anywhere.  I think they're better than at Tessaro's.

Second, this is the only place I've ever been to that besides just having a fantastic beer selection also knows how to serve each one of them in the correct way.  I grew up in Germany and am really disappointed every time I go to a restaurant here and order a good German beer and it comes in the wrong glass or way too cold.  You know, like when you order a nice Franziskaner Hefeweizen and it comes served like a Miller Lite in a pint glass with no head and a sheet of ice on top.
At the Sharp Edge, they do it just like it's supposed to be served for every beer you order: right glass, right temperature, right amount of head, and they have all the best beers from all over.

If you like burgers and/or good beer, you can't pass this place up.. Great burger, not the best I have ever had, but good. Great service. Good atmosphere.  I had the fries too, and they were steak fries style and nom nom.  They have a huge variety of food to try, and the people I went with had the pasta salad and various sandwiches .... I will go back to this place if I find myself in the area, or if I need another business meeting out in that area of the woods.... I'm relatively new in Vegas and I've been searching for a bar to enjoy great whiskey in a relaxed setting. I found it as a Double Helix. The entire staff is amazing. Try to go while Dom is working. She's an amazing bartender with the best personality, always a fun time. They'll always have my business.. Best BBQ ever! Try the gangnam set!!!
Great night with the family!!!
Lots of beer too. I live in the neighborhood, own an older car that I don't want to get rid of, and rent from this Enterprise on special occasions, especially for trips north to the Canyonlands. I have been treated with unfailing courtesy and fairness. On a recent rental I needed a pickup. It was pretty dirty on arrival and they asked for a few hours to wash and clean it, then gave me a free day for the inconvenience. On another occasion I arrived just as they were locking the gate, the woman on duty opened it immediately and rented me a car without a word of complaint. A good spot to find a vehicle when you need one.. Amazing pizza thick or thin. They know how to get it done. Wings are decent, but make sure to request well done on delivery. Oddly enough, they have barbecued ribs that are among the best around. 

They offer pick up or delivery at your choice. 

On the weak side, salads are very average. Go for the pizza and you won't be let down.. Third visit, eating my way through the menu and haven't been disappointed yet!  It's worth it just for the awesome sides and salads, but everything is fresh and tasty.. Great lil power lunch place on weekdays! Had the chinese chicken salad and honestly it was one of the best! Very reasonable price, great A+ service and laid back atmoshpere in a very nice shopping venue. Will retrun soon for PIZZA (aka my kryptonite). This is my favorite sushi restaurant! I recommend the Jay roll and Joe special. This is definitely a restaurant that you could go to more than once!. OMG - Kung Pao Chicken!!! SO damn good!
Never order the small, you get Bang for the buck! on food here with the large. The lady handed my amazing Kung Pao Chicken, and my arm literally dropped, had to weigh it, 3.5 lbs of food for under $10.
General Tsao's chicken is also amazing! Not a bog fan of chinese food night, but always williing to go for some Li's Bowl!. --- I was worried about the price in fixing my car, I was surprised ... I spent a little bit more in my other car than in my BMW.... Bela told me what parts and labor, and I took a step in faith by other reviewings and here is mine: take a step... . He even got me a rental for work..., honest Bela...and his crew... helped me big...and the moment I drove my car (12.7.11) I could feel the difference from the day I took my car to him... He told me : it will take 2 days to get the job right done!  Enrique. Kudos!!!. Called "Secrets"...lol...It's gone gay(at least on Friday nights)....classic ;-). Unreal!!! 4.5!! Second time eating here. I must not have been paying attention to the food the first time as it was a guys weekend. This place is off the hook!! I was talking about the Braised Beef for at least a week later and the drinks were nice and strong. I am definitely going back next time in Vegas. Decor and lighting were very nice.. Some of the best I have had, fresh and the staff is great! If you like sushi you need to try this palce.. Note: There are two Ethiopian digs here. One is a cafe, and the other is GoJo. The latter has a blue awning. The former seems unhappy for what must be a daily influx of confused white people.

As for GoJo itself; It's the bomb! The prices end up ridiculously low per person if all that is ordered is a shared platter and perhaps a cinnamon iced tea (highly recommended). I don't know why out of all the Pt's, this one is the mot popular one out of my group of friends.  It's always poppin, maybe because its in CHinaTown, the spot where everyone usually hangs out before or after partying.

Danny the bartender is pretty cool. He seems to be everyones favorite.  What I like about Pt's is their 12-4am happy hrs.  Pool table fills up quick on the weekends and they serve pretty good food.  Warning: Their hotwings are pretty hot or maybe I'm just a wuss, but I'm just sayin' though to warn other wusses like me.  And oh pretty hot girls come here too, just sayin'.. I always like to support the businesses close to home and can honestly say the quality of the sush is outstanding! The last sushi joint that was in this exact location before was always dead and even though I supported it I knew in due time it would be closing. I have been to Nori twice in the last couple weeks and it is always filled with people.. Not as good as Wholeys but awesome patio and the best service. Go here for the atmosphere, the staff is the best.. This is the best place to get your groceries and produce in old town, where oddly, there is a shortage of decent grocery stores. You won't find a friendlier staff - very different from your standard grocery store wait-in-line experience.

This place has great quality groceries and produce and low, low prices. They've got a great selection of bread, an awesome deli, super quality and great prices. Huge beer selection. I even dig their granola and wasabi peas from the bulk bins. Lots of choices for hummus, and you've got to try the chicken curry salad (in the fridge left of the deli).. Radio Maria was one of the first restaurants in the current resurgence of downtown.  When it opened around 1996, two upscale restaurants had come and gone in the Mike n' Molly's space, and other than Great Impasta, in its old location, there was nary a place to eat downtown except in bars/ short-order cafes.  RM made quite a splash, and I thought it pretty good the first several years.  Nice space, creative menu (for CU),  and some good servers.  Then things starting going south as more and more better-quality eating places opened downtown and elsewhere.  I feel they often try too hard with their entrees...too many conflicting influences and tastes.  I am all for fusion cuisine done well, but I think they lose the forest for the trees here a lot.  Now, the new tapas bar I like quite a bit.  Very reasonable, GREAT beer list, better service, and b/c of the nature of tapas, a more focused concept and execution of cuisine.  Both spaces are nice - they are adjacent to each other.. Oh how I love this place!!  I did a yelp (yelped?) and the reviews were pointing us here, so I grabbed my co-worker and off we went.  Parking was easy, finding a spot on the street after 6pm (went on a Tuesday).  

Upon entering, we were told we could choose our table, so we went bar-side, near the sushi station.  We were quickly greeted by a waiter who took our drink order while giving us the daily special rundown.  Very pleasant interaction.  Another waitress delivered our drinks and explained they'd both be taking care of us tonight...both were just spot on, attentive and very fun.

I'll get to the good stuff---- the food is amazing.  I opted for the dozen steamed shrimp as an app...being from Baltimore originally, these were perfect.  Great flavor and pretty large.  My coworker opted for calimari...was lightly battered and tasty.  For the entree, I opted for the mexican volcano and kinda licked my plate (don't judge me).  The shrimp were huge, had a nice little (very little) char to them and went so well with the lobster bisque and taters.  And the asparagus was so good too.  Just a great meal.  She went with a couple of sushi rolls and raved about the freshness, quality and flavor.  We did not leave room for dessert, which I was bummed about.

Run to this place...great service, very clean decor and a really fun atmosphere.  Top notch all the way around.. So much fun definitely coming back! Safety officer  Livio was great from the very beginning recommend him. What more could one want than some freshly chucked oysters!? Their happy hour is a killer value, staff is knowledgable and makes great recommendations. Can't wait to come back!. This review is for Rain's Day club --

Grand opener last Saturday to kick up their spring break and i must say, it was insane. Great hot weather with a nice cold beverage. DJ was on point. Its an every Saturday event from 11am-4pm. Free as long as you mentioned DJEFX on their table guest list/line. There are two levels. Second level is to view the entire venue and first floor is where all the pool and cabanas are at. There are three different bars. Center stage gets the most attention so choose the ones on the side for less wait. Took me half an hour to just get one beer. Overall, nice and big.. So Sivan was our waitress and she was phenoms. Loved her. Great recs on drinks, sociable, and just a fun person. We would come back just for her, but our drinks were good and our app was great (fig and chicken flatbread).. In town for business and stopped at this lunch spot. Great place for breakfast or lunch. Salads are fresh and great sandwich choices.. We got here two friends after we saw the reviews on yelp and it was just great.
Service was super fast and friendly 
Food was in the table after maybe 3 minuths 
And the price was unbeatable $10.78 for two people, wow
I would recommend them to everybody 
Thank you. Love the view its not filled to the max with people and room to move around.  GREAT SPOT FOR VIEWS. They have a membership but you can get in several different ways.. Great Service and Truck Hand Wash. This place is really nice.  the people are friendly and courteous, the casino, a little on the smaller side, the restaurants, well, so so.  However, for a downtown establishment, it's quite nice!. Maybe I was hungry but I liked the food we had here.  When we got there they were going to seat us inside the main dining hall but I asked if we could sit in their patio area and they cleared out a table and sat us there.  It was Saturday night and the people watching (primarily girls in tight, tight, saran wrap dresses pulling down their dress every 5th step) was fun. We shared a mixed deep fried calamari, shrimp, onion plate which was quite large and very good.  I had a chicken sandwich with avocado, bacon, and cheese which was one of the better chicken sandwiches I've had.  Plus the fries were crisp, salty enough and just plain great.  The waitress was pleasant and took a dish off our bill when we realized we had over-ordered.  Very nice of her.  I just thought this place was really good and would go back for a simple bite any day.. Please, please, please In-N-Out Burger...PLEASE open a restaurant in the Chicago area!

How far would I drive for an In-N-Out Burger? To be honest, if time allowed, I would go as far as 100 miles, one way, for one of your delicious, fresh, hot, "Double Doubles"!  I'm crazy huh? Yeah, crazy for their FANTASTIC burgers!  And shakes too!

I know that locally sourcing their food products is the key to this chain's high quality standards and popularity.  Whenever I head out west, I make In-N-Out a DEFINITE stop. I've been to several of their locations in Arizona and California. This location in Peoria is one of my favorites! 

I think the closest one to me here in the Chicago area would be in Texas. It's outside my "100 mile limit".  If money were no object, I would fly frequently to Los Angeles (LAX) and visit their location nearby. It's a great spot to watch planes land while enjoying one of the best burgers you'll ever eat from a fast food chain.

The staff is always friendly, the food is top-notch. They don't have a big menu, but that's okay. You come here for the burger, the fries, and the shake. Those are their specialties. 

I only have TWO wishes for the corporate honchos at In-N-Out:

1. PLEASE open a location in Chicago
2. PLEASE stay open 24/7.  I sometimes CRAVE one of your burgers at 6:00am.. If you have to stay in Phoenix during the week, this deal cannot be beat!  I was dead tired at the end of my work day when I crashed here, so I can't speak to the amenities, however the room was cool, the bed comfortable, the staff friendly, and the price was unbelievable.

I would love to come back with the Mrs. and have a mini-vacation here one day, the cost of a round of golf for guests of the resort is really good, and the rooms include a sink, stove, and even a dishwasher, so it'd make a great mid-week vacation.

Also the french toast is excellent... I highly recommend it.. My wife and I goto Blue several times a year (mostly for special occasions and what not.)

They've never put a foot wrong.

The service is impeccable, the wine list is extensive, the martinis delicious, the food delectable.

My absolute favorite has to be the summer seasonal Pork Milanese.  

Had the Tenderloin last time and was suitably sated.. i'm not a big wine drinker.
but i really like learning things from passionate knowledgeable people.

1. get there by 1pm, not a lot of seating, maybe 15 chairs. 
2. have a cell phone or computer to look up names etc.
information over load, save for later learning.

3. look at the wall of 6 gallon bottles fermenting.
4. get excited about new tastes.

5.now i've seen the scientific papers that casts doubts on our real abilities to judge wines. but it is fun and tasty.

a craft business. father - son.
nice people.
when i think about small business, i will think about places like this.
we bought 4 bottles. about a year's supply at current drinking rate.

on the way out, drive around the fountain, watch the wind direction, get in the spray....

thank you.. Our favorite close to home spot for take out, and for watching games. The wings are great, better than the "other" sports establishment. Plus the cheese curds and pizza is pretty good as well.

I do however agree with the other reviews about the service being hit or miss, but overall it's pretty decent.. Terrible Herbst is I think one if not the best "local" owned gas station chains here in Las Vegas. This one in particular has a Mc Donald's built in with it, (Don't make me go there. Read my McD's review. ;p) as well as an oil change and car was in the same area.

The staff always seem nice and I tend to like the late night staff better as they seem a little more "crazier" and well for working at a gas station at night I think it's needed as it can be a little shady sometimes at night in Las Vegas.

Be sure if you are buying any kind of alcohol or tobacco that you have your ID ready as they WILL ask you for it even if your 90 years old.

They have the usual gas station assortment of treats, needs, and drinks as well as a Crispy Cream display, which in my opinion is great for those late night munchies runs on the way home from the bar.

I have never seen any trouble here and generally at night, there is usually a highway patrol car or another cop car parked close by. (Bet it is the Crispy Cream Display!)

Don't be afraid to check this place out if your around.

Best Regards,
James "Culinary Schmooze" Williams. Very clean, Good Coffee and free wi-fi. Great food, great service. Obviously fried chicken isn't the healthiest food on earth, but once a month I get that craving for good fried chicken. Their chicken is great, doesn't seem too fatty, and their sides are excellent too. A+. A little small but cozy. We had an americano and espresso which were top notch. We didn't eat but the food coming out looked good. Bathrooms are shared with the building, and you need to get the key. Would go back and would recommend to anyone.. Fast, Friendly, and Excellent Customer Service. Jeff is great!. This is a quirky place. Full-time place of business. Full-time artist gallery. Now you'd think that wouldn't work... but it does. Ah, the strangeness of Tempe and web-workers.

And though it's not open to the public at all times, I'd be on the look out for future events here. The outside patio is immense and beckons with a great view of the mountains and stars. It's got night time entertainment written all over it.

Can't wait for the next time!. Great sushi and service coming in for dinner.  And fast!  We ordered four rolls and expected a little bit of a wait, but we weren't even done with our edamame before these tasty rolls showed up.

One of the better sushi places I've found in the Valley.. McMullen's isn't as authentic as a real Irish pub, but it is close. Also the food is pretty good, on that note I might add that the Irish Nachos are humorous and tasty. Furthermore for Vegas its prices are fairly decent.  The interior of the bar/restaurant is fairly nice, though they did put it on a little thick with quotes from Irish writers. That being said McMullen's isn't half bad and could be considered a diamond in the rough when it comes to Vegas.. Writing me review a little late, but better late than never! A good friend of mine and I visit here every once in a while to grab dinner after work. He always get's the fish tacos, and I've had various things off the menu. I've yet to have anything I didn't enjoy, the burrito was larger than a football and very flavorful.   The shredded beef taco's are definitely not the quality of tin foil wrapped street tacos, but still quite delicious.   My only real complaint is the salsa. It's quite bland without much kick, the warm chips are awesome though!  Definitely a place we will continue to go for convenience and knowing the food is reliable. Oh, and the staff is also really friendly!. The Cine Capri now features a  Dolby Atmos sound system. Its one of 37 in the US that have it so far, but expect it to catch on! It is 64 discrete channels of surround, allowing sounds to be placed with pinpoint precision in 3-dimensional space.

Many of the speakers are now directly overhead - allowing for accurate portrayals of rainfall, or awesome jet flyovers. There's also around a dozen in the back - so if there is ever a Twister 2, you'll be able to be INSIDE the tornado, sonically at least. 

No, they Don't show 3d flicks at the Capri, if you want to see a 3d version of the flick, you can catch it in one of the many other theatres here, sans Dolby Atmos and giant screen.

Projection system is as good as ever, maybe better. If you are a techno-geek or audiophile, you have to hear this system to believe it.. Went there tonight for dinner while my son had practice. It was great. Food was fresh. Fast service. Clean restaurant. But more important,  very friendly staff and reasonable prices.. We like this dog park. I am afraid we like it more than our timid dog. We give it credit for socializing our previous dog. Parking is almost always easily available. Seating is frequently a problem, particularly if you want shade. Although there are some dog water fountains, they are not easy to use and our dog can't figure them out. We bring water and share  with other dogs. If you visit about the same time every day you get to know other dogs and their  owners. The park is well maintained considering its heavy use.. Amazing tacos! Really good quality food. Staff is nice. Excited to come back and try more items on the menu!. So why is it there are either German bakeries or Jewish bakeries? 

Discuss.

 What no Scandinavian bakers out there? I grew up in Minnesota where German bakers ruled. Every day after school and before my extracurricular activities (which included trombone lessons, practice with the B squad basketball team and a fitting for my scoliosis brace) I would get a cinnamon crisp and a blueberry filled glazed dough nut. 

After feeling nostalgic for those pimply, greasy haired in the closet days...I wandered into Karsh's. So. Glad. I. Did.

Yummy on the Cinnamon crisp and double yummy on the blueberry cheese danish. I assumed the service would be friendly, I mean, after all, how can you be crabby when you work with frosting all day. And I was right. Each time I've been, they've been sweet as sugar and always offer a free sample. 

Free sample. One bonus point for the Jewish bakery. I don't remember the German bakers giving out free stuff. Hmmm...

Discuss.. Great taste of "old Vegas" here. Great food that comes to you in the simplest of menus that include all the house wine you can drink! Watchout for dinner rush.. The best grocery store I've been to. Lots of organic fruit and veggies, bulk bins for as far as the eye can see, and if you can't find a type of granola you like then you should give up on granola.

They basically have everything you need, and you don't have to shop at the chain stores.. Awesome place. Cheap entertainment.

Not sure why it took me so long to check this place out. I was only there for a few minutes, killing time before heading to the Thomas & Mack for the Rodeo. I put 50c into a Star Wars pinball machine and played the 3 balls. I then put $1 into a TMNT machine and got a lot more plays than I thought I was supposed to. It made me think, "Maybe I left some credit on the Star Wars machine." Sure enough, I went back to it and it had a few more credits left to use.

The point of that ramble is this: Your quarters go a long way here. I definitely have to come back. I didn't get to walk around the whole place and check out every row. As others have said, this place is truly a hidden gem.. Made an appointment to come in at 10am on a saturday to have my windows on my 2014 Mustang tinted. Wheeled in and was greeted by Madison. Very friendly and she immediately brought me into the showroom and waiting room. The showroom was where I saw my tint... I opted for the 30 percent ceramic gave her my keys and went to the waiting room . The waiting room was outstanding with a big screen TV , leather couches  , a large table with tons of magazines neatly placed. Underneath the tv was an assortment of chips , granola bars and cookies. Next to it was a mini fridge full of water, mt dew, diet coke and all the sodas. Mind you I came in at 10am and to my surprise left at 11:30am!! 

The mustangs have windows that come down just a little bit to clear the top when opening . and when closed they roll back up . Usually the installers have to shut that off to install the tint. Madison made sure to inspect my car to make sure they were turned back on and she checked the quality of the job. The installers placed a tape across the window opener to ensure I don't accidentally roll down the windows. Gotta keep em rolled up for 48 hours to ensure the film is cured to the window properly.

Oh and another thing!! Don t forget to use your 10 percent off from the Yelp Check in!! that was an added happy for the day!! 

Love this place!! Highly recommended .... I'm gonna send my folks here to install tint on their cars.... Amazing people! Maria, Mikey and Tanya make you feel so welcome. If you get a chance to meet these people, your stay will only be better. The facility is great with everything you would want or need. The new renovation is nice but the bistro is not as good as the old restaurant they had. It was a much warmer and inviting feeling the old way. Newer isn't always better. Other than that, the people make it great!. Another great experience, amazing origional gyro. Actually dined in this time,  brought the food right to you and cleaned your plates when you were done. Amazing service. I've read comments about pods that talk about other locations. They don't sound at all like the same company that I'm dealing with which is the Tempe location. In fact, the comment from Angel H. is outright false if he's referring to pods mesa storage location - pods lists two storage locations for the valley: Mesa and far west side. I inspected the Mesa facility after reading negative commentary about their competitor's facility. It was modern, spotless, well organized and secure. It bears absolutely no resemblance to what Angel described.

I've been dealing directly with Katelyn, who is a salespeople I met when I went to look at the Mesa storage facility. I've been able to reach her without going through their 1800 number and without any hassle. She's been right on top of my order - it's not like I've had to chase her for info or followup.

I'll update this review after my move is done but, overall, at this point, they seem like they know what they're doing. Based on one of the comments on this board about a different pods operator, I will check my furniture after they get it to the warehouse to make sure it wasn't dropped. If the people driving their trucks are properly supervised, this kind of complaint shouldn't occur.

As far as the size of the pod, they're listed on the pods website. If that's not enough to visualize its holding capacity, you can see one at their warehouse.. First time there and love it! Owner was most gracious. Ordered a 8" cheese for my daughter and a Greek pizza for us. Owner brought out a few garlic knots free and they were gone in seconds! Pizza's were hot and delish!. Summary:
Food: excellent
Service: beyond excellent

So my wife and I flew in last minute for the weekend and had no plans or reservations for anywhere on a Saturday night.  We were staying at the Palazzo and decided on Cut.  I made a call down to the restaurant and they were able to fit us in. We had the last available slot (so the receptionist says).  When we got there, she wasn't kidding.  We had the last open table.

Chris was our waiter and he did an outstanding job.  Great people skills and very attentive to our needs.  I'm sure the other waiters are just as good, but ask to be put in Chris' area when you check in with the hostess.

Warning:  The place is not for you if you're squeamish about what the bill will be.  You're in  Vegas.  Expect to dish out the money.  It's worth it.. I have been here several times, and never disappointed.

I like to judge a taco shop by their tacos, I am funny that way!

First time I got 3 tacos...
1 Fish Taco -Delicious! and huge! two fish tacos, and I could be done!
1 Lengua Taco -If you don't know what that is, you might not want to order. OK it is beef tongue.  I love them, when done right! At Apache it was tender and flavorful!
1 Carnitas Taco - Perfect classic!

The ONLY thing that could have made the tacos better would be homemade tortillas.
And yes, I know it is a lot of work! (But one of the things I adore about Pinches Tacos in container park!) So I can hope!

I have also ordered Carnitas Torta - Also really amazing! tender meat, super fresh bread. 

Great little place! Happy to have it in the hood!. Was in a sushi mood, but wasn't sure where to find good stuff at decent price. I was yelping and happened upon this place. We pull up, it's a simple location in a strip mall. Fairly intimate location, not what I would call small, because it doesn't feel small, just more like cozy. Service is very good, willing to help you out or suggest things to try. They do have specials as well, but we didn't try them out. We opted for a couple of different rolls, plus this Lobster tempura salad thing with this amazingly flavorful and spicy dressing. It was fantastic, although the mouth numbness took over after a while, but damn it was so full of flavor, and the lobster was super fresh and tender. Prices are very reasonable and the fish was very fresh tasting. They also have a very small bar in the back, room for 5 people or so. Very nice experience, would definitely go back.. This place is great! The fries, the burgers, chicken, everything is really good I recommend this place to everyone!. Tastes JUST like "Home". Born and raised in "Metro Detroit", Bloomfield Hills/Royal Oak, Michigan that is... I know all about Kerby's, National, Lafayette... We just moved to Vegas and we were exploring and just happen to come across this place. I couldn't believe my eyes! The dogs are from Dearborn and the chili is from National, both shipped in... oh so is the Sanders hot fudge and FAYGO! Oh how I missed all of it. The place is full of Detroit teams, Lions/Pistons/Tigers/Red Wings/UofM/MSU. Also has signatures and names from people who have visited the place. 

If you want a taste of Home (michigan) definitely make a visit, just a short cab ride from the Strip! 

Oh and to cranky pants Barb M. and the other person complaining about the service or time for food. Try owning a place that serves a SMALL menu and that place being in an old part of town. The food is just the way it should be and the service has been great every time I've been in.. I was recommended this place from a friend, then my parents tried it, and said to check it out.

I was cautious at first. I'm from NJ, I've had good pizza and I've had good pasta from a pizza place... Man was this place good. 6.99 for a TON of food, and it's great, too! Just like home. 

I had the half portion vodka sauce over linguine, comes with a side salad and garlic knots. I couldn't finish it. I wanted to finish it. It was so delicious. So glad this place is right down the road. If you're from the east coast and have a craving for pizza from home or pasta from a pizza shop, like home. Check this place out!. My Die Hard Gold battery that was installed in August of 2010 failed on me this morning.  Jumped my truck to get it started and drove over to Sears Auto at the Chandler Mall.  My Gold battery has a 3 year warranty so I was hopeful that I would get it replaced under warranty.  I was greated by Eric Ramirez (Emp # 467787).  Very professional guy, pleasure to deal with.  We got thru the paperwork and he quoted me about a 1 hour wait.  It was almost exactly 1 hour when they completed the battery replacement and the paperwork was done and I was out of there.  No cost due to the great warranty Sears has on the Gold batteries.  I arrived home and as I always do when work is done on my vehicles, I double check the work.  I am happy to report that all was well; all connections tight, nothing damaged, looked great !  Thanks Sears, you guys did well today.. I don't go to laundromats very often. Like once very few years. Usually when I run out of clean clothes on vacation. So I'm not an expert on them. 

The lady working there was nice. And the washer and dryers were fast but a ton of the dryers (more than half maybe) were out of order. It wasn't super busy when I went but I'm sure that it could be a problem when it is.. I'm really impressed with this place.  I think some people may give it bad marks because it's sums up everything beautiful and wrong with Scottsdale in one meal.  The location in Keirland, lends RA to be a haven for the Scottsdale douche elite to hang out at the chain sushi restaurant with mexican chefs, order a dynamite roll and reminisce about the time they ate the freshest yellow fin at the Grand Wailea resort on Maui.    And I got to say, I saw a couple of them there.  But sushi is a funny thing.  You can't fake freshness no matter how hard you try, and the fish here tastes like it was flown in from Japan, Alaska, or Hawaii this morning.  Blows places like Yume out of the water.  My wife and I wondered in on a Saturday afternoon and to our delight happy hour was in effect.  Long story short, we ordered a lot of nigiri, ponzu marinated sashimi, a couple of hand rolls, gyoza, and 4 beers for a total of $64 including tip.  I'd definitely come here during non happy hour, but I have to say, this is going to be my new place for Saturday afternoon indulgences.  You see, like the mexican sushi chefs that work here, Scottsdale is a bit of an anomaly.  There's no real culture here other than the one that's been put up by developers.  All the authentic real grit that resides in the Downtown Phoenix, has been washed away, polished up, and desert that used to be considered no mans land nothing is now the height of luxury in the Valley and its only getting better with time.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that beyond the Pottery Barns and the overpriced Hemingway Cigar Shop bullshit, there are local businesses that have adapted and learned like the chefs at RA and they are turning out spectacular food and doing it really well.  Don't let any other reviews change your mind.  Come down to Kierland on a hot day, sit at the RA Sushi Bar, order a cold beer, a couple pieces of maguro, and suck up all the Scottsdale ambiance you can muster.  Douche bags included.. Excellent pub and killer food!. We stopped here based on a recommendation from close friends and I can say that any negative review is emphatically incorrect.  We ordered Chicken and broccoli, Wonton soup, General Tso's Chicken and an egg roll.  The egg roll was fantastic.  The General Tso's Chicken had just the right amount of spice.  The Wonton soup was immensely flavorful.  All in all this place has a style of Chinese food as close to "New York" style as you are going to get out here in Las Vegas.  It's a total "hole in the wall" kind of place, so don't come expecting fine dining. They have a drive thru and picking food up seems easy enough. I totally recommend this place wholeheartedly and will return many times to sample the rest they have to offer.. Hands down my favorite Thai restaurant in las vegas. The food is always consistent and the service is great. I love the yellow curry here, the perfect blend of spice and sweet from the cocnut milk. The sauce is a little thicker almost to gravy status and not super runny like other places I have tried. The pineapple fried rice is another great dish. The combination of sweet from the pineapple along with the peanuts, shrimp and rice is amazing. Come check this place out and I promise you won't be disappointed.. I used Steve a year ago and just did again, and he will continue to be my carpet cleaning guy for as long as he is in business because he knows his stuff, answers everything honestly, I trust his advice. He has even talked me out of certain products/services I thought I needed, even though it would have benefitted him financially. Does not get any better than that.. This place just opened up three weeks ago and man it is great.  Don't be too intimidated by the place because they are still fixing it up.  Its best described as a start up sports bar.  The prices are pretty good for a new place.  It sits right on the corner of 83rd ave and has a little dirt lot outside.  

We got the hot wings which were very good.  The sauce is homemade with a kind of smoky/southwest spicy taste to them.   They were very good!  The bar serves drinks that are tall or short.  The drinks were pretty good too.  Bartender very knowledgeable.  The staff is very friendly they have plenty of hopes for this place.  My only complaint is the crowd.  While I was told that this place will start to have a DJ and Live band it seems like the crowd here is very diverse like it is fighting as to what type of people will take over this bar and grill.  If you are heading to westgate this is a great pre drink spot as the drinks are very cheap!  

I would recommend this spot to anyone wanting to try a new bar and see the hard work and effort it takes.  This is a great place and has plenty of potential to be awesome.  Check it out its worth at least one drink.. I've been here twice in 3 months and have been treated very well both times. Unlike most hospitals and medical offices, I don't have to worry about spending all morning or afternoon sitting around waiting. I was seen within 15 minutes of my appointment time on both occasions (that's nuts) and had no problems with paperwork or copay transactions. Great staff, plenty of seats, lots of productivity happening. Only suggestion: not everybody likes the same shows.. Two TV's and no variety, but I can deal with that.. I really enjoyed my dinner here.  The service was fantastic.  I had teppanyaki, which is offered as a prix fixe menu with mixed green salad, miso soup, your choice of protein (steak, scallops, shrimp, lobster, chilean sea bass, etc.), and dessert.  Surprisingly, the chilean sea bass was the cheapest offering at $60 for the prix fixe, and that is what I had because I love the taste and texture of the fish.

I rated Okada 4-stars based on this one experience with the teppanyaki, which was very good.  But without having tried the sashimi here, 4-stars is as high as I could go for now since my current 5-star experience is reserved for Morimoto in Philly.  I hope to try out what everyone else has written about in their experiences.  Until next time.. Had a friend come in town and tell me about this place! Right one the strip as many times as I been never knew it was there. I'm glad I was exposed to this. They were very helpful explains what their product was and allowed me to taste each flavor! Was disappointed they didn't have they most famous flavor available! So many toppings to choose from and the waffle cookie topped it off!! Also my fav part is them offer discount for military!!! If you ever are on the strip this hot Vegas summer and I know you will be!! Check them out right next to cvs on the side of the casino New York New York!!!. Definetely my favorite place to eat when I'm low on cash. This place is a wrestler dream. They make any pizza you desire and all you have to do is ask. For a 7 dollar buffet it's definetely your best bet for cheap!. Roy's serves Hawaiian Fusion, which is always an interesting combination of flavors.  I had the pleasure of trying the ahi tuna, the salmon, the butter fish, and the short ribs, each of them distinctly different, and each of them excellent.  

The service was fabulous: the wait staff was knowledgeable, fast and quite pleasant.  My water glass was never empty (despite me being a generally thirsty person).  And despite being rather busy, my server kept things moving quickly and smoothly.

If you're looking for a great place to take a date, or just a nice place to have a GREAT meal, visit Roy's.. Oh Lux, my biggest enemy. Every time I go I cannot help but get 1 or 2 of their delicious pastries. How can one place be so delicious?!? Oh man and there Jalepeno Bacon Mac n Cheese is insanely good! One of the best places in Phoenix in my opinion. Great breakfast find! I really love the quiche, and the potatoes Daphenois were so soft and buttery! Delicious pastries as well. A bit small inside, so not too good for groups over 6. Outdoor seating available.. Sage is a restaurant where you can be casual in an extremely elegant envrionment....every table is a good table...none are too close together so you feel private even in a large room and service is meant to pamper.
  The food is straight forward without being the least bit oridinary...a poached orgainic egg doesn't sound new or anything special or typical fine dining fare...but put it on top of a delicate slightly smokey potato foam accented with shaved black truffle and a pine nut espuma..ART!  To take a humble food and elevate it to a very special place is not easy.  Sage does this. 
Expect that you will have a feast for all senses.

  And when you are asked to see the Absinthe cart at the end of you meal complete with at least nine international and domestic varieties...ACCEPT...it is presented and prepared traditionally or with a Vegas twist...on fire if you dare. DARE...it's amazing. It gives you an energetic buzz and you feel less full...a true digestif!...the whole point right?
The menu is eclectic and yet varied and fanciful...

The chef also offers a 6-course tasting menu that isn't printed but can be available if everyone at the table is the mood to participate and have an extra special dining experience.  It can even be vegetarian or vegan and accommodate taste restrictions...and for the money...have a wine or artisnal beer paring with it.  STUPENDOUS....$120 for the food and $60 for the  beverage pairing!
Great bar and outrageous cocktails.. See review under "Ultimate Auto" at the same address.  This is a duplicate listing.

Hugely recommend Ultimate Auto if you have a BMW.  If you don't, well, you're out of luck as it seems that is all that they do.. Great customer service! Small branch inside Albertsons. Never very busy when I go in.. I like this Dennys but depends on who the waiter/ress is......we have Antonette as our server and though she was the only one serving she Rocks.....great service great food........big tip coming her way.. This is my favorite JD location. It's my to-go place for everyday lunch and by FAR the best  option in downtown (yes, I said it. Screw you Le Thai, Eat, and other hip places ).  You can go healthy with soup and salad or  nuts with ice cream and muffins. 

What really makes the difference is the staff. Great customer service! Everyone is always friendly. Place is clean and food quality is consistent. 

Because I go during the week, I usually get soup and salad. One of the best options for healthy eating. After a while I find it difficult not to get my greens for lunch. Honestly it is the best lunch under $10 ($9.60).  

I think I have been here more than 70 times during the last couple of years. 

Lots of bureaucrats, cops, and attorneys!!. Great cocktails and amazing food.  The scallops and grits special was the best dinner I've had in recent memory.  I'd be here every week if I lived in AZ. If my preliminary service from an on-line order is any indication Al and Donna are awesome!  Not only did they throw in a couple of extras for the two Bromptons we purchased they also gave us a break on shipping.  Can't wait for the bikes to arrive!. This is definitely one of the best Japanese restaurants in the country.
 
They have a large variety of sake and the staff is very knowledgeable in describing each bottle. You must try the tofu, both cold and fried, Kobe beef, scallops and the fluffy cheese cake. I can't wait to go back and try some more dishes!. Absolutely marvelous food. Do any veal dish!. Went to Kabuto in Charlotte's University area with my previous boss today.  The service was wonderful, the staff made sure I was happy and the food was wonderful!. My Girlfriend Loved this place! Tiffany, Tony and Ken did an amazing job on her fill and ped, even helped her pick out the perfect account!. Quick fast and easy price is great 18.99 plus 2.00 coupon for yelp check in. Easy as it comes you get in and out not much to it. I've been to a few trying to hustle me but these guys don't and are great!. Mom and pop boba shop. Hidden gem!! Next to La Bonita! Super nice people knows about customer service. Not employeed by teenagers, owner work and puts love into it.

Tried everything so far so good!!

Definitely try DeliManjoo!!. Cross this one off the list! I finally had a chance to try the new breakfast place on State Street! Aptly named Short Stack, the pancakes are where it's at! So many options, I will need to come back several times to try them all! This is a restaurant that order at the counter and claim a table. Ordering is a breeze, finding a table is not necessarily easy. Though, tables seem to open up in a timely fashion.

I LOVE their order numbers (I don't have a better name for it) - old license plates bent to display your order number! It's the little details like that, that makes this new restaurant stand out amongst the competition. I also loved the rustic light fixtures and furniture... it looked like someone did a great job at the local rummage sale. Doesn't look tacky. Works well for Short Stack Eatery.. Just got back from Paris and was looking for a bakery that sells kouign Amann... We found a very popular place called georges larnicol that had these things called kouignettes.  Anyway... We were very disappointed.  That kouignettes sucked in Paris.  We're now convinced that no other bakery in the world has better kouign Amann than this place.  Not to also mention the croissants are delicious as well.  We love this place so much... Everything is top notch.  Visit 1 bakery in Montreal you must visit this one.... Beware, orgasm in your mouth.   Love your biggest fans, ralph and tommy.. This is a great juice shop.  Fresh juice, friendly service!. Very small cafe-style spot in a strip mall. Habanero's offers amazingly good authentic food that you would pay double for down the street. They have everything from breakfast burritos to unique daily specials. All are served with several delicious salsas. If your not trying to impress a date, then try this for an affordable, casual, neighborhood experience.. Have been wanting to go to Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken's restaurant since being awed by their performances on Top Chef Masters.  I was not disappointed.  
To start off, the staff were lovely - attentive, humorous, engaging and very helpful.  The decor is inviting and vibrant, setting the tone just right for a fun night.
Yeah, it's just Mexican food, but it's fricking delicious Mexican food.  To start, would recommend the appetizer sampler - the most amazing corn tamale ever along with other succulent delectations.  I also recommend the braised short ribs - some of the best short ribs I've ever had, and believe me when I say, I've eaten a whole bunch.  My wife had the special which was a seafood chile relleno which was a little heavy on the carrot salad and sauces, and a little light on the crab.
All in all, worth the trip down the strip.. Of the seven Cactus League Spring Training facilities I have been to for a game, this is far and away the best one. It's not surprising it would be the best considering it is the newest and home to our Arizona Diamondbacks! Oh...and the Colorado Rockies. SRF has a great seating area, but I feel all the fun is had on the lawn. Maybe not the best view of the game, but you're not going to a Spring Training game to watch baseball anyway, are you? It's all about hanging with friends, having some beers and people watching. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge baseball fan, but I'm estimating the average over/under on pitches I watch at a Spring Training game to be around 20.

If you're going on a weekend, I recommend getting there a little early if you are with a big group so you have space to put down a blanket. Only a few going? You should be fine finding a spot around game time. 

Big tip of the review: Go to Zipps on Via de Ventura and Hayden for pregame food and drinks and then take their shuttle over to the stadium.. If you're craving family style Brazilian BBQ in Las Vegas, then Bertolucci Brazilian Steakhouse is your place to go! The food and service here are excellent. 

We found out about Bertolucci because of our hotel concierge. It was recommended as the "best value for all-you-eat Brazilian BBQ in town". With such credentials, we decided to check the place out.

Arriving there, we were promptly met by a friendly hostess who offered us a comfortable table, with a gorgeous night-view of the Strip. The place is kept very clean and tidy. Our drinks and appetizers were served promptly and even before we had the chance to visit the salad bar, the first round of the meat was being offered at our table.

The staff were very friendly, always asking us if we had any preference for a specific cut of meat, at the same time ensuring that we never had to wait to refill our drinks - one of my greatest pet peeves!

At the end of the night we were surprised by the Chef, who personally sang a couple  karaoke songs. He even asked us if we had any favorite song we would like him to sing.

Result: Great food - very fresh and well cooked - with plenty of variety, excellent service and a comfortable atmosphere that made us feel like we were eating BBQ at our best friend's house as we watched the games at their 80" TV while sipping on some Caipirinhas.. If you go Veggie, pick a dish where the Tofu is fried in the wok, not steamed. So much better.. went to Panda Express many times and it's delicious but I have never gone to this one. I was in the area so I went the Lee Lee Supermarket to get a boba. It was delicious but I'm talking about Panda Express. I got orange chicken and fried rice to go and when I got home and smelt the food, my mouth was literally watering. The orange chicken is delicious but a little spicy. The orange syrup that they put on there is very creamy and it hits the spot. It's crunchy on the outside and pretty soft on the inside. The crunchy outside gives it an incredible texture and the chicken is very flavorful. The fried rice tasted good and it was buttery a little bit. When I was there I sampled the spicy chicken and it was good but not spicy. It tasted like orange chicken but less syrup. Believe it or not, the orange chicken. is spicer then their spicy chicken. I will go to Panda Express again but I don't know if I will go to this location. For this is the best chinese food I could find in the area.. Finally found a great cuban restaurant in the valley. Drove by thousand times and decided to give it a try with a special coupon. Surprisingly it's really authentic cuban food. 

The place is bigger than it look from outside and the waitress were very nice and friendly. The owner also came to say hi and ask if there is anything to improve. Had wonderful lunch experience at the place. Will come back again.. My favorite German eyeglass frames temple pieces were bent beyond repair.  I had had three sets of lenses installed throughout the years.  I went to one optician in Henderson with a new set of temple pieces from another pair of glasses that were the same style and size.  He told me it was impossible, that he would have to grind down the hinges and it was too much work.

I found the Las Vegas Opitical Frame Fixer on Eastern Avenue near the 215.  I went in and the store was very upscale with a huge selection of frames.  I explained the situation to Danny Harris, the Licensed Optician who runs this store.  He examined my glasses and the new temple pieces.  He stated it was no problem to change out the old pieces for the new ones and told me to wait five minutes.  He came back with the new temple pieces installed correctly and my glasses actually did not slide off my nose anymore.  I asked him how much I owed him.  He stated NOTHING!!  He told me to come back when I had a serious problem with my glasses.  What a nice guy!!!  Next time I sit on my glasses and break the frame I will be back!!!. This place just created a TASTE-GASM on my tongue !

Best Mediterranean place around Tempe give this place a go !. very helpful staff!. Great amount of good food for around 30 bucks 
4 types of pizza pastas crab legs warm and cold shrimp mash potatoes meats Chinese Japanese Mexican and various sweets to choose from. Great location near the light rail, devoted baristas, good soy chai teas, clean interior, plenty of parking and free Wi-Fi.
I can easily pick up the internet unlike Lola Coffee where you need a password. I can't be bothered with that.  

Seriously. What's not to love?. There's no question about it, the buffet food here is phenomenal and top notch. Lots of variety, fresh, colorful, tasty, everything to please the most discerning or picky palates.  The atmosphere is great except maybe for the smoky smell from the casino but that usually doesn't bother me.  Waitstaff are always available and friendly.  If you want top notch buffet food at a great price (about $15/person), then this is place to come!. First happy hour here for several years and it was well worth returning for another. The quality of the food was excellent: chicken flatbread, all salads, tortilla soup, fish tacos, all were great.  Alcohol prices were reasonable at $5 for several wines, martini, manhattan, margarita..  Desserts are not included in happy hour but not ruinously priced. Service was great, whenever we needed something she was there and bus staff was always close by. We were impressed. There was a surprise when the bill arrived as the low priced items add up. Price, including tip came to $141 for four. Still a great meal for the price.. What a great idea. Get a huge roasted porker and sit him in the window for all to see, heid and all. Then serve up big shredded portions of him on a bun with a choice (or combination) of sage and onion, apple sauce or sweet chilli relish. Additionally you can get some crackling for an extra 50p or so. Brilliant.


 I'm deducting 1 star for the fact that you can't get a nice cold beer to wash it down. Otherwise no complaints from me!. Found Chris through Yelp.  Shop is clean.  I came in because my mechanic found an exhaust leak, but he doesn't fix kind of problem.  Chris showed me the problem and fixed it in less than 30 minutes.  Afterward, he showed me his work and the welding looked perfect!  I'll definitely be using him again.  I have a 2006 Ford Taurus.. My wife and I came down to Scottsdale for a couple of nights (see review for Hyatt Regency Scottsdale) and planned to try someplace different but when we hit a couple of dead ends (Monday closures) we decided to come back here and I am glad we did.  We had another 5 star experience, maybe 5+ stars.  We were seated immediately at our favorite table (no. 27) which is ringside to all the action in the open and busy kitchen.  Bandera's cocktails are always near perfect and generous in size (Manhattan straight up and an Elderflower martini).  We started with their seasonal grilled artichokes which taste like an artichoke steak accompanied by their signature skillet cornbread which is almost a meal in itself.  We split an entree plate and added another side so we had just enough room left to finally try their banana cream pie which was good but not spectacular.  I had tri tip steak which was wonderfully juicy and cooked to a juicy medium rare.  Our servers and runners was genuinely friendly and attentive making our entire dining experience memorable and delightful.. Delicious cookies! Make their own ice cream. 
Some small tables out front to enjoy your treats. 
Will be back.. Skyler and Natalie are awesome. Went there regularly prior to moving to Des Moines. I got bored with my regular order so trusted them to make my order...and it was ALWAYS awesome.. The breakfast was delicious. (Bacon, egg, and cheese croissant)  The only thing keeping them from more stars was that they were out of ham, cheese, and jalapeño croissant.  I have yet to try a donut or coffee here.. Every time I come home to Scottsdale, I make sure at some point during my stay to stop in at China Lite and get a Sergeant Chang's Chicken to go. I have a deep love for this dish, it is reminiscent of General Tso's style chicken, but without the fatty, greasiness! There used to be a China Lite up on FLW right by my house, but it closed, so I drive down just to get this dish! I rarely eat in here, the decor is nothing exciting, rather bland in fact, but the food is always ready to take home within 10 minutes, and is super affordable. I also enjoy the Crab Puff appetizer here (Partan Cream Chease), and its been awhile but the Honey Crisp Chicken is also very good. If you come for lunch you can get these for even cheaper! All of the other entrees are made according to China Lite's "healthy chinese" practices, without sacrificing flavor. I am friends with the family that owns the chain of these restaurants and am happy to give them my business! Gotta have my Sergeant Chang's! Yum!!. I love this theatre because it is for adults only. This makes a simple date night into more of pleasant experience because their are NO babies, young kids, crying or screaming!  Man....and they sell angry orchard!  Gluten free alcohol sipping boy I was. 

I will say if you can avoid the spoon and fork theatre.  The better one is the other theatre because the chairs are bigger and they recline without touching the person behind or in front of you.  

Happy viewing!!!. 非常好味的店家，就在拉斯维加斯的唐人街里面，四川、云南口味都有，也很地道，有过桥米线、水饺、麻婆豆腐、其他炒菜等，菜量也很大！ 如果你来米国一段时间非常想念家乡味道，那这里一定是首选！ 我们是在拉斯维加斯后两天才发现这里的，索性连吃两天^_^ 让吃了好几天自助大餐的我们觉得好解馋、好过瘾啊！ 女老板人很nice，全店中文交流！. "Where the Boys Are...."

Man store.
For men.
Testosterone check at the door. You fail, you leave.
Best hardware selection in the city. Makes me laugh at Home Depot and Lowe's.
Walked in here last week. Had a bolt, washer and nut I needed to replace. Showed it to the guy at the counter. He took one look at it and said, " 8 millimeter, 8.8, aisle 16 , 3rd shelf from the top."
Wow.
Found it right where he said and it matched up perfectly. Browsed around and saw all kinds of tools and assorted hardware.
I love this store.
You will too.
If you have testosterone.. This place is the same as Falbos (which I also give  ) and I really love the pizza here. It is topped with many mushrooms if you order them. I really recommend this place.. An excellent place to grab a fantastic burger. Had the "Cheese Burger Soup" and it was delicious. Then the "Market Square Burger" that was very good. We sat at the bar and were able to observe the cooking and preparation. And I must say it was an incredibly clean operation. Can't wait to go back!. Great food. Wings are crispy like I like and well sauced. Like the idea of ordering by slip so you can pick and choose. Very friendly staff. Will definitely return.. Found this via yelp reviews and what a great find. Sat right down on a Saturday afternoon. It is located right off the freeway and very convenient. Atmosphere is family friendly, fully stocked bar and a number of beers in bottle. 

We shared the urtha-za pizza and it was spectacular. 

This is a great restaurant all the way around. If you are passing through or a local try this place out.. Natalia was great.She is the restaurant manager and there was a problem with the ordering of the kids meals. We we're told the kids meals were drink, pizza and desert. When the waitress came back after we ate  she said sorry there is no more left for desert. She said sorry nothing we can do. But then Natalia came to the table and took care of the kids meals and said sorry for the inconvenience. I would of never gone back to there if it wasn't for Vanessa the waitress and natalia doing what they did and taking care of us. Food was awesome also.. Me and my brother were in need of a pedicure.  We found this place by chance and walked in 10 min before closing. They were very accommodating and Hanna and Christine were more than happy to stay late to get us in.  Very friendly staff and a very clean establishment.  Men don't be shy to try this place the girls working here are very helpful with our needs.. Great place to watch football and can't beat the prime rib species for Thursday night for 8.99. Our waitress Bella was super nice and friendly also.. Very good food and service.  Large portions served.  Rhonda was our server, very attentive, kind, and fun to interact with.  I certainly recommend this establishment to anyone wanting an excellent meal and cold adult beverage.. Awesome burger place. Not only does it serve some of the best burgers, but they also make some of the best malts and shakes ever. Their cocktails are also very creative and tasty as well.

-Gold Standard Burger

This burger is composed of a variety of high quality ingredients, which serves to highlight the deliciousness of the burger. The aged goat cheese provided a gaminess to the burger, which really elevated the flavor profile. The bacon provided a smokiness, which is reminiscent of a smokehouse. The dry aged patty really brought out a beefiness that is not ordinarily found in most burgers. The tomato aioli, arugula, and other remaining components was able to bind together and make it just a great interpretation of a classic burger.

Other entrees:

-Billionaire Burger

Another casual but awesome burger restaurant in the Cosmo hotel.. Excellent service!. This place is awesome. Good food, great service. Don't be persuaded by those who left bad reviews...been to this place 2x, had the mild chicken fingers & pastrami sandwich...and everything was great. The speciality fries were awesome. Very reasonably priced. Don't pass up on this place you won't regret it.. If you have never been here, than you are missing out on local gem of a deli. The owners are soo sweet & you getting real deal here. I just had a Italian sandwich and it's one the best I've had ever!

They also have some unique olive oils & other related grocery items that are hard to find.. Thank goodness for this Treasure Island/ Mirage Tram train.  I think this was the first tram in Las Vegas.  Ride this train to escape the heat when trying to walk between Mirage to Treasure Island.  it protects you from the sun, the heat and gives your feet a break from all the walking you do in Vegas.. As soon as you drive in front of Gaucho Parrilla your stomach starts growling because the Argentinian grill smell that comes from this place is just awesome. 

I shared the asado plate with my wife on my first (and only visit so far) to Pittsburgh and I thought it was just delicious. Being on a low carb diet, it is hard finding good stake dishes without all the other very tempting sides but this one needs no sides. 
The only temptation was the buttery bread that came with the dish that my wife and son were raving about. 

All five cuts of beef served were great quality tasting meat, very tender, very juicy, and perfectly cooked (I like my steak medium/medium rare). 

On a plate with NY strip, filet, sirloin, and flank, I thought the skirt stake was the winner. I would love to try their chorizo. I can't wait to return. 

The restaurant is very informal without waiters (you order at the counter and they bring the food to you) so seating space could be an issue. But it wasn't for us. 

All I have to say is that (given I am on a high protein low carb diet) I would be going to this place every single day if they opened this restaurant in the DC metro area. But, for now, I will be content with the fact that I can only eat here when I visit Pittsburgh so this is a required stop for us when we return.. We just ate dinner at this new restaurant in the heart of the art district. The food and service was outstanding. The owner Brien came out and talked to us like we were family. The atmosphere is warm and cozy. We shared many wonderful dishes. We tried the "Ray of Light" penne pasta with spinach, pine nuts, and panchetta, delicious! We also had the "Sweet Home Alabama", "Everybody Wang Chung Tonight", "Bangagong", and "Born on The Bayou". They were all outstanding. Each dish was bursting with flavors. Chef Abby really outdid herself. We sampled her cream puffs and fruit tarts and have to say they were some of the best in Las Vegas. 

We can't wait to come back again. Check out the menu, you'll love it!. With the string of gorgeous weather recently, I found myself in dire need of a bike to cruise my daughter to the park with and a 29er to hit trail the plethora of desert trails with, and these guys delivered a SMOKING deal on two bikes last week.  Thanks a million!

In an attempt to avoid buying more cheap shit from China I wanted to buy a few USED bikes, however my craigslist karma cosmically sucks for some reason and I had such trouble locating good used bikes free from deceit and general douche-baggery.  These guys are the real deal.  Down to earth and straight forward.  Great used bikes (and some new) at fair prices, and don't be afraid to haggle a little.. I had an appointment at 10:00 and they were finished by 11:15.  I chose the nanoparticle tint but was undecided on which percentage tint I'd like on the rear windows.  They installed 20% on one window to see how it would look but I ended up going with 10% instead.  Being from California (aka The Rip Off state) I thought I was going to get charged extra because of the last minute change, but was not.  I highly recommend getting your vehicle tinted at DC Auto.  It was well worth the 4 hour drive to Vegas.. Visited the YardHouse at Red Rock Casino over the weekend.  It was pretty late, well after midnight, and we obviously got right in and sat down.  Wasn't too crowded.   Wait staff was accommodating and friendly.

I had the chicken lettuce wraps.  My girlfriend had the asian pork bbq appetizer.  Both were pretty good.  The beer is good and they do have quite the collection from which to choose.

We like to go there roughly once a month and that won't change after our latest visit.  Definitely a pleasant atmosphere and good place to get some food whether it's early or late.

4 stars!. This is the best place to get hotdogs in the Phoenix area! This is a transplant of a small Buffalo,NY hotdog chain.  The meat is flown in several times a week from Buffalo.  The dogs are great! The Weber's mustard is also a local Buffalo condiment. Don't forget the Ted's sauce on your dog too. It's basically a combination of ketchup with slightly spicey tomato relish. You can also get a foot long or a "jumbo" (really thick) hotdog. The "Jumbo" burgers are great too.  They serve Polish and Italian sausage too.  The onion rings are a great side.  You know the food is great here because there's always a line.                Be prepared to order your dogs, burgers etc while standing in line.  Don't  be one of those people that holds the line up by not having a clue what you want. If you've never been there before, read the menu posted above the grill area. You don't have to tell them the toppings you want until you reach the cash register area and your stuff is cooked.  After your order your dogs they will ask you if you want any fries or rings,  then later they will ask what you want to drink.  This type of ordering confuses some people.  It keeps the line moving, so play along and enjoy some great dogs!                                                                                                                                If you want to bring some stuff home to enjoy later, they sell the hotdogs in 5 lb bags(roughly$5 per pound.) They also sell jars of the Ted's sauce and the Weber's mustard). This place is a cool place in Charlotte.  They have Salsa dancing on Thursdays that can get pretty busy.

I usually come here midweek, but hear that  weekends are fun too.  The bald headed bartender was very friendly and knowledgable.  The IPA I had was really good (but just a tad warm).  I am staying at the Holiday Inn across the street so this is a good low-key find right next to my hotel.   Was described as a Bank Of America bar and not a Wachovia Bar, I guess the two of them compete in this town?!?!.........Kidding.  Have fun.. I only go there on Tuesday evenings : Trivia Nite. Dallas is very good as the Trivia Master. Really enjoy the Music Round, except when he plays Rap, Spice Girls and other Pop "Music"   ( noise ). Ryan and Cassie are Excellent @ their Jobs.

Their Chicken Wings are pretty good and they carry about a 1,000 Beers.
Tuff to find a parking spot though.. What can I say about this place that everyone else hasn't? Chill environment, great staff, and the customer service is the best in the valley in comparison to other vape shops. 

I had Damien do a build for me. Every other person that has built on my box mod would be lucky to get me to roughly 0.6 ohms. This guy is probably the best builder in Vegas. When I bought my mod and atomizer from VapeCo, they said that I would be lucky to get it down to 0.5 ohms. This dude took my atomizer and built me a dual coil setup that read at 0.2 ohms consistently. I would easily pay $10 or more for this dude to build for me. Also, if you desire it, I believe he even knows how to do Clapton coils. 

Joel, their marketing guy, was awesome and showed me their awesome juice selection. They had a plethora of juice and they didn't make me use one of those cruddy pen mods that every other vape store has to try flavors. They actually had a dripper that I could try it on or they gave me the option to use my own.

Get this, they actually have personalities and chat with you unlike other vape shops that sometimes act inconvenienced when you walk in. They've earned my business for the foreseeable future.

Customer service is 5/5 and selection for juice is a 5/5. They even told me that they're expanding their juice lineup. Queue a Spinal Tap reference, where others may go to a 10, these guys go to 11.. Nick is by far the best bartender in Vegas behind Chance "Boom Son" Weber. You should come see Nick if you're having a good night or even a bad night. Either way it ends well.. This is a good subway! Just like any other one. But the employees are nice and helpful.. Super affordable lunch spot with some of the best gyros I've ever had!!  Very friendly and accomodating staff handing out discounted cards for the next visit:). I'll definitely be back again. So far the beef shawarma and lamb gyro have been delicious and great portions. Greek salad was good too with a very bright dressing and real feta cheese. They also have a variety of local teas to make up for the lack of alcohol. Highly reccommended!. Got the sugar cookies at the airport and they took me back to childhood.  I love them!!!. Great pizza! Even the small pizza's are a great size.  My table ordered a Numero One-O and the Clark Street Meat Pizza.  Best of both worlds of meat pizza's.  Both were great.  You always worry at pizza joints if the pizza will be dosed with grease, but not here.

Service was quick and friendly, especially for us rolling in with around 15 people.. Wow!  These guys are really fair priced.  Do their work quickly.  And do not rip you off.  They took off 45 min worth of work that was written into the quote they gave me without me saying a word.  I called a couple of dealers for a part (drivers power mirror) $190!  They installed one and buffed out a small scratch benith it for $114.  They will get all my future business, I recommend them to anyone.. Great tacos for cheap !!. It's not very often you find a business that tells you how to do it at a lower cost without giving up quality. Shay is such a business man. His work is great and he gets my projects done on time. Need something printed and don't know what to do call Shay at a Printer 4 U.. One of the best places to eat in Champaign. They have a great value for their food! My favorites are the burritos and the chips are delicious.. This place starts where it should, with outstanding coffee!  I'm enjoying a Columbian pour over that is really tasty, robust nutty flavor yet smooth.  The space is small but it's location, inside the 7th street market gives it an open, airy feel.  There are plenty of seats around the counter and yet it's still a small, boutique location.  Very hip feel, it's a great spot if you're from out of town like me and looking for a local coffee shop to get some reading or work done.  Enjoyable!!  Free wifi, parking is free if you remember to have them validate your ticket.. We visited this restaurant on Feb 12 2010. We've been here a few times before but only for the bar area. They have an extensive wine selection but nothing to write home about. A few rare gems can be found (5 Turley Wines). Unfortunately, they rely heavily on Italian varietals. Mostly Nebbiolo and Sangiovese, both of those are not to my liking, but I digress. The atmosphere was buzzing with a steady hum. A local place where the bar area is mixed with bankers, musicians, software engineers and CEOs. All entertaining new acquaintances merrily, along their wine and cheese selections. 

On to the Dinner. The Service was attentive and prompt. The Waiter, Giancarlo was very helpful and suggested a great Russian River Zinfandel. We started with an Endive & Fig salad. It was delicious, with bits of blue cheese and sugared walnuts, but a bit on the dry side. The Main course was a lightly tossed capellini with slightly roasted tomato, fresh basil and EVOO. It was perfectly cooked and amply served. Nora's is about sharing. All the portions are served in platters and basins, so I would suggest one appetizer and one entree if you're sharing.

Overall I was very satisfied with the ambiance, service and food but there was something missing. Maybe our selection didn't showcase the chef's brilliance or maybe the intent is to nourish and imbibe casually, while the conversations and chats take center stage. Either way, it's was not a mind-blowing experience, and that's ok. I will definitely come back again and again.. My homie was all hatin when I brought him here cuz he's a big representative of sumo sushi and he hasnt been here in 3yrs. Told that fool he's been missin out on some good sh*t.  Every sushi comes out warm and melts in ur mouth. And damn, no name sushi is a sushi that screams out f*ck every other sushi cuz I'm the best!
Skip ordering individual sashimi and go straight to the spicy seafood salad. Trust me, you'll thank me later by taking me out here, your treat.
This place is so good even Amish people were effing in line, no lie! Come early as hell though cuz this place gets more packed than yo filipino momma packing random stuff in cardboard boxes to send to Philippines.
And oh, get the red bean ice cream for dessert.. We had a large group and the service was great and the food was exceptional. 

Coconut shrimp and ahi tuna appetizers were prepared flawlessly.

Macadamia crusted mahi mahi was excellent and the Teriyaki Flank steak was cooked perfectly.

Jumbo drinks were expensive but that's to be expected.. We checked out Jersey Mike's last weekend and it was a pleasant experience.  We sat outside, of course what's not to like with this Phoenix weather right?  Nice crew with lots of enthusiasm in there.  I would say that you would receive a quality  lunch in a family atmosphere here.  Good vibe.. Located inside the Imperial Palace... we arrived here with a party of 5 and was asked to wait about 30 minutes. It looked pretty full in the waiting area so we just went back downstairs for 20 minutes to mess around on slots and craps (came up $100 because of the wait!). Just keep in mind the buzzer they give you doesn't reach the casino floor so go down there at your own risk. 

I got the fried chicken eggs benedict and it came out in a heaping portion (with a very very decent price). It came with bacon, swiss cheese, spinach, tomatoes, these most perfect mashed/hashed potatoes and a sauce to marry them altogether. I definitely would suggest splitting this place. I'm a pretty heavy eater but even this one was a hard one to take down. I ate about 80% of it and was full for most of Saturday.

I noticed that the actual wait time between ordering and getting the food seems to be quite awhile-a surprise for ordering breakfast food, but of course, I got over that quickly. I also noticed that there were tables empty for awhile yet people were still waiting outside to be seated... not sure if there was a reason they weren't seating people immediately.... I believe I posted a very thorough review of this wonderful "Mom and Pops" business for the related Yelp Elite Event. But, I have since gone back and had them make me a gorgeous set of 3 Chocolate Flowers for a lady that I WAS seeing (got dumped yet again.....boo hoo hoo). But at the time I was SOOOO excited to get these made because as you can see in my picture, these came out absolutely gorgeous! There is an incredible amount of craftmanship that goes into these pieces of art, so that's why they cost $15/each, and let me tell you that they are SO worth it! 

They can make them ANY color you want.....so you guys out there. IF you want to do something special for a SPECIAL lady, get some Chocolate roses made here or at their new Ballentyne location. 

And their TRUFFLES and BON BONs. OMG!!! They are incredible! Sure they have your standard hand-made Truffles and Bon Bons, BUT they also have some experimental flavors and unique chocolate combinations that will tickle your taste buds for sure. Like their White Chocolate Cardomom with Orange Zest that is really unique. I believe they won some award for this one.

But to me, I just LOVE their dark chocolate Truffles. I'm a chocoholic so I go for the gusto!

And everyone in the store is super nice, knowledgeable and patient. They have lots of choices in the shop including other "gourmet" chocolates that are brought in from other high quality suppliers. 

All in all this is really a fantastic shop that provides you with premium chocolates at reasonable prices given the quality of the product.

HIGHLY recommended!. One of the best Thai places I've been to. Love that they use Thai peppers to spice up your food instead of the dry spices.. Great old school, cheap breakfast place.  Small standard menu you can't really go wrong on, hit up the cinnamon raisin toast too.. It's been a while since I've been to the Omelet House but the memories from my recent visits bring to mind a tasty breakfast experience. For the early birds (like me) it's important to note that they aren't open super early (7:00 AM) but if you're hungry it's probably worth the wait. The dining area is made comfortable by the homey diner decor and I've always been pleased with the service. 

All three of my visits consisted of similar orders (omelets/homemade chips) so unfortunately I cant speak with much variety but that should also show how much I enjoyed the omelets. First and foremost the portions are HUGE, there is no way you will leave hungry. I've had the Popeye, .38 Special, and both the Porky and Petunia Pig omelets with the homemade potato chips and never finished my meal in one sitting. My Popeye was a little under seasoned but the other two I had no issues with. I usually get sourdough toast (dry) with my breakfast but I've had the pumpkin bread once and it was a pleasant alteration from my norm. Nice and moist with good flavor and not too sweet.

This Omelet House is definitely a breakfast spot I'd recommend.. If these things are PokeBalls then I'm Ash Kechem because I WILL catch them all. 

The place is small and kind of hidden but very nice and clean on the inside. I tried a lemon flavored paleta and loved it. Not too sweet or tarty but perfect. I also tried some of my girlfriends Aroz Con Leche which was also really tasty.  

I haven't tried all yet but I will be back!. Good place for a guy to get his haircut. Been there several times with a different stylist each time and while my hair can be most difficult they've all done a good job. Knock on wood.. there are a lot of italian restaurants in town, but none are as good for the price.  we love the angel hair pasta with meatballs.  great comfort food.  we also have them pack sandwiches for us when we're picnicking or enjoying jazz in the park.  try it for lunch or dinner.  you won't be disappointed.. Just outstanding craft beer. I honestly can't say enough good things about this place. 

All of their employees are, at minimum, level 1 Cicerones. So, you get an education along with your beer. The El Jefe and the Mint Condition were big highlights for me. 

Do not hesitate to visit this brewery. It's worth the trip to Freemont just to visit Banger.. 2nd time here ... Awesome service ... The Brussels sprouts side had a touch of honey and was amazing !!! The trio of sauces made the steak. I have eaten at many steak houses in Vegas ... This is now officially my favorite. I'm always impressed when i eat a sandwich and think - even though the ingredients are listed on the  wall, there's no way I could ever put them together in a combination that would be this good... It's baffaling really... House made tea and lemonade also spectacular - cafe americano was quite lovely as well. Avoid the 11-2 Lunch rush - we got there at 3 and still had a 15 minute wait, but well worth it.. Dinner for 2, beers, good sized portions,excellent menu, excellent food, good drinks, $40 including tip. Can't wait to go back. Awesome great food service drinks. I forgot what I had but this is our family fav mexican food place around. I switch between Room 112 and Enso for uptown sushi. Room 112 is smaller than Enso but has a great menu. I think the prices are better than Enso and the spicy tuna is more to my liking than others. If you go, get there before noon or you will be waiting!. My wife and I stopped in for lunch on a recent visit to Charlotte.  We had the Fried Green Tomatoes and Parmesan Potato Poppers as an appetizer.  The tomatoes were fried to perfection and were served with a horseradish dill sauce.  The potato poppers, which I do not recall ever eating anything like them, were delicious!!  These were served with a choice of horseradish dill or parmesan peppercorn sauce.

My wife ordered the Chicken & Dumplings with a side of Smoky Lima Beans, and I ordered the Cajun Meatloaf & Mashed Potatoes with a side of Collard Greens.  The chicken & dumplings were plentiful, a really big bowl.  They were very tasty.

The meatloaf was spicy and came served with a brown gravy, which was more of a redish color than brown.  It was very tender and delicious, one of the better meatloaf's I've every had!!

Our waitress was very good, kept a good check on us.

i would recommend Dish!. Had to find a new place when Golden Star on Bell rd. closed. My family and I have eaten here 4 or 5  times.

The staff is friendly and courteous, the restaurant is clean.

The food is served quick and is always hot and fresh. The Orange Chicken is the best I have ever tasted anywhere. My wife and I usually enjoy the Shrimp w/vegetables and our kids split a large Orange Chicken. I must admit the I find myself sneaking pieces of the chicken throughout the meal. The crab puffs are good but the egg rolls are not really impressive.. Our child recently started at LSP and it is FANTASTIC! We have tried many different daycare facilities and this is BY FAR the best! They truly care about each child and getting daily notes about his day telling us what he did, ate, and what kind of day he had is priceless...this is the best money we have ever spent! We HIGHLY recommend LSP to any parent who wants nurturing for their child. It is NOT daycare...it is sooo much more! Glad we found them!. Tick Tock, TIck tock... and no I'm not talking about my alarm clock. I am talking about my ticker. that's right, my own personal ticker!  I just went in for my annual physical and to my surprise my EKG came back abnormal.  I then proceeded to get chest x-rays and additional blood work done.  After consulting with several medical experts, I called up tri-city cardiology and scheduled the next necessary test which was an echo cardiogram/ultrasound for my heart.  They got me in right away and were extremely professional and polite on the phone.  They even had an automated call back so you didn't have to wait in line on the phone to make an appointment. Obviously they are highly recommended.  I had the privilege of working with Dr. Berkowitz who reviewed the ultrasound and other basic tests and he was a complete gentleman.  He was well informed of what was causing my "irregular heart test" and made me feel at ease.  Fortunately, I am going to live ladies and gentleman and feel great. In fact there is nothing wrong with me (as far as my heart goes)!  Anyhow, I would highly highly recommend this group of cardiologists and their support team. They put me at ease, my doctor was extremely knowledgeable and I wouldn't hesitate to go back in the future.  What a positive experience.

ZAck. Strangely enough I don't think I have ever gotten a pizza from here. When I visit I go for the Philly cheese steak. Although they are missing the authentic bread of Steakout or Pop's, it is a very good sandwich. For a quick, casual lunch or dinner, this is one of my wife and my favorite spots in Henderson.. A nice and friendly place to have a quick bite. All the food was delicious and reasonably priced. More of a relaxing atmosphere, and the service is not necessarily attentive so if you need anything just ask.. Pretty good food and a fun place to come with the kids to let them run around

It can get really busy on the weekends so come early or be prepared to wait. The Top 3 Reasons that made me quit my two other gyms and join Mountainside:

1. Towel Service - this may seem petty, but ain't nobody got time to carry around a damp towel in their car all day. For early morning exercisers, this is a big step up from most other gyms. Full bath towels and small exercise towels available for every visit. 

2. Workout Equipment - a large assortment of free weights, sophisticated machines, kettlebells, foam rollers and the TRX system with racks. You'll find dedicated spin class and yoga rooms, and depending on the location, basketball courts and boxing rings.

3. Locker Rooms - big and clean, with ample room to change clothes, do a dance, or whatever. I really like that they've got both a sauna and a steam room.

Short of paying top dollar for a resort style gym, Mountainside impressed me enough to quit both LA Fitness and Gold's, where I had active simultaneous memberships. I am very pleased with my switch. They even offer a discount if you turn in your previous gym's key-ring pass. Check them out!. Food was great but music was very loud. We had tapas and they were all good. Margaritas were tasty too. But music was so loud it was hard to carry on a conversation. If that tone down the music for diners I'd give 5 stars.. This is a great neighborhood bar in old town. Granted the place itself is nothing special, they don't even have space for beer on tap. But the quality of their service and their food is outstanding and the variety of bottled beers caters to all tastes. Most importantly, it's impossible to go to Karsens without having a good conversation at the bar. I particularly recommend this place for people who are alone and want to socialize.. If iI had known that the official title was "Gallagher's Food and Fun" I would have been in here a lot more often when I lived up the street. 

As it happened, I would come in from time to time to watch the Suns, especially during playoff time, when this place really gets jumpin. 

For all other intensive purposes, Gallagher's is a reasonably priced, solid sports bar. The food is good but not outstanding, and the staff is friendly but will show you the door in a hurry if you give them problems. 

If you're in the area and looking to munch on some wings and a beer or two, it's definitely worth a pass through.. Ok. Health Scale goes out the window. We're Talking about dessert!  Custard is so much yummier than ice cream. If you've never had it it's time for a new experience. I love custard!. This fabulous boutique was one of our favorites during our trip to Montreal. Great labels/designers. INCREDIBLY helpful staff (thanks for the tips Meghan!) and lovely space. Great for guys and gals. A must check out.. great concept, great people, great fun.  worth the short trip from the strip!. I went here to buy some tires. The first time I got two Dunlop tires and planned to return and buy two more. Later I returned and got two and left. However I realized that I got the wrong version (they were similar but different). When I came back the next day to return them, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately they only had one of the tire I needed. However, while handling the return/exchange the associate also found another store which had the tire in stock. Overall, great service and friendly Staff... At least in automotive.. I thought it was really cool that they are open 24 hours here.  It was about 11:20 p.m. when my brother and (now) sister-in-law stopped in to get their license.  They had three windows open and the process took about 10 minutes.  The clerks were very friendly.. Confirmed: the banana nut bread was AMAZING!  Buttered it up and inhaled it in about 2 seconds flat..........ok a bit of an exaggeration, lets call it 20 seconds.  Had one of their scrambles and it was pretty darn good too.  Would have given 5 stars, but the one thing missing from this place...........is character.  Like alot of other really good breakfast places, it is located in a strip mall.  Food is still great, location not so much.. Now THIS is good Caribbean food.  We wandered in a little after noon, and the place was empty... Four tables, and the nice lady who runs the place.  I could tell right away that this was going to be authentic.

I ordered the curry goat, and washed it down with a bottle of Kola Champagne.  It was just like old times, when I was offered curry goat by a Jamaican woman I knew in New York:
"Would you like some curry goat?"
"I don't particularly care for goat."
"Have you had curry goat?"
"No."
"You're having some curry goat."
Yes, curry goat is delicious.  This curry goat definitely met expectations, with a hearty flavor, and very tender.  It had the texture of a good pot roast.  And it had some potatoes mixed in, which taste great when soaked in curry goat juice.

The plate also came with some rice, some of the most delicious plantains I've had, as well as a green salad I could have done without, but ultimately appreciated because I really should eat my vegetables.

No, they're not the fastest place, but it's really like eating home-cooked Caribbean food.  And you don't go eat at someone's house and expect their service to be the most efficient, do you?

The essence of this place was perfectly captured by my coworker, who after I mentioned it might be added to the rotation, said, "F@#k the rotation, I'm eating here every day!". If they closed this place down, I think I might have to stop my annual visits to Vegas. Quote me on that.  I WILL STOP VISITING VEGAS IF THEY CLOSE DOWN THE ROYALE.  

 Let me clarify for the sake of my review, that I have never stayed in the hotel. I usually stay at the Mirage, or the Wynn, but if and when I decide to gamble, I definitely go to The Royale. This is the "dive bar" of casinos on the Strip, and whenever I give out Vegas advice to people, Casino Royale is usually at the top of the list, despite the ever present dive bar stench. It's a heady aroma of stale beer, the sickening sweet odor emanating from the attached Ben and Jerry's, cigarette smoke, and lost dreams. Now that I've probably scared you away from sitting down next to me at the Blackjack table, let me give you 5 reasons to go here if you are in Vegas-

1) Let's say you like to gamble, but you carry a low bankroll. $5 Blackjack and $3 Roulette, and friendly dealers. Enough said. 

2) You are walking down the Strip, and you want a brew.   $1 Michelob and Michelob Lights (makes me feel like I am back in the '70's). Also, $1 frozen Margaritas, and 75 cent Coor's Light draft (you think if I brought my Stone Balloon mug they'd fill it up for a quarter?). Those Michelob bottles are ice cold too, and for years I have been served by very friendly bartenders. Especially the dude with the stash. That guy hustles like you've never seen. 

3) $1.99 foot long hot dog. Perfect for the Vegas munchies especially if you've had 72 of those $1 Michelobs. 

4) The ridiculous faux game of skill, that the MC outside is always hawking to pedestrians walking by out front. It's a slot machine that stops each wheel when you press a button. The prizes vary, but you can win coupons for things like, $50 or $100 Free Play on certain slot machines that only pay out if you hit $1000, 2 for 1 Michelobs (so good), and match play coupons for Blackjack, and Roulette. 

5) The location. I can't imagine what the real estate is worth even in this economy. It's in between Harrah's and the Venetian, and directly across the street from the Mirage. I don't know who owns it, but I feel like I am supporting the little guy, without having to go downtown or off the Strip. Also, I am sucker for places like this, and have actually had some great luck gambling here. Yeah, its scuzzy, and smells, and gets a bit loud, wait, am I describing my friends or a casino? Whatever, just go and drink one for me.. Good food and drinks. I have had the shrimp that looks like what you would get served in san pedro there and tacos de pescado.. . There customer service is spectacular.  Answer all my question. They really do stand behind there products.  My dog is a picky eater. They have all sorts of sample pack to try. Best yet dog foods made in Wisconsin. Glad I went. Keep up the great work.. Living in Las Vegas and always being around food has taught me a thing or two about eating out. I was a patron of Andres downtown, loved the small feel and personal touch offered so the first time I went to Andres at the Monte Carlo I wasn't sure what to expect. Upon making your way through the casino you find yourself at the end to the left you see the sign for Andres with a hostess booth and a classy bar. Just past the hostess booth to your right is the entrance to the dining room, if you go straight ahead you see stairs. I turn right and the doors open to a small yet beautiful and intimate room, with no more than 15-20 tables. 

The food is most excellent and I have never been disappointed with any of the dishes. I try to mix it up and get something different every time. 

Upstairs, another bar, cigar lounge, more seating, and the restrooms. ;). Second tripwas better than the first.  Taco's are worth the trip.. It was unbelievable how amazing my oranch chicken and fried rice was to perfection. I mean seriously she Chef speaks no English so you know your getting genuine Asian Cuisine. I come here about once a week and will keep coming. Thanks Asian Island you guys are the best!. Great job Bobby Flay! Goat cheese queso, house burger and house bloody Mary the meal was complete all the way through. If you're looking to spend a little more than usual on lunch, please check out Mesa. Worth the money and the wait if there's a line.. The newest store with the nicest staff. Nothing but helpful and friendly people, great prices, selection and location. Alyssa made my returns and purchases a breeze. Welcome to the hood!. Our first time dining here and we will return again.  Our waitress, Danielle, greeted us cheerfully, brought drinks, took our order and followed up with just the right amount of attentiveness.  We ordered the flat bread 1/2 off Wednesday specials.  I had the BBQ topping minus the onions.  The sauce might have been a bit more tasty but the flat bread was really good.  The lunch time crowd was modest but everyone seemed to be served with a smile and the food came out in a reasonable time period.

The decor is quite interesting and is a nice change from the often sterile atmosphere of many a grill.  Give the place a try.. As a traveler and boba drinker, I have been to many places. Cafe Teaze is the first of its kind in Las Vegas. The atmosphere is great, delicious drinks and great tasting food at a reasonable price! The staff is very polite, helpful & gorgeous. I would recommend this place to people looking for a place to hang out, drink tea and experience something new.. If u haven't eaten here you're missing out.  If you have, I don't know why you're reading this review instead of eating pizza right now.  This place has amazing dough. Amazing sauce amazing toppings. Yum yum yum. If you don't mind going H.A.M. on the price of some pizza this is the place for you. 

Only thing close in town is five 50 @ Aria. After a great night at the Hostile Grape in the M Resort, we needed to eat! I was with a group of friends and we were low maintenance. Somewhere in the M that offered great food at an affordable price was alright in our books. This place was conveniently open at the moment so the decision was made!

Speaking of convenience, this joint is directly above the Hostile. Such an easy decision! The restaurant is completely open and part of the casino. In fact, the open vibe makes for the the dramatic affect. Large floor to ceiling windows offer a lot of lighting during the day and great valley views at night. There are multiple level seating for a variety of guests. When we visited this place they are just about to close, so the service, although cordial, was a little bit rushed. Our server was very patient and nice enough to offer split checks for the table. 

For my late night dinner, I decided on the Imperial burger for $13.  A burger made to order, topped with stout braised short ribs, mushrooms, Gruyere cheese and caramelized onions. This burger was served with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and pickle spears on the side. You also have the option to add fries for another $5. They have different flavors and toppings, however, I just chose the salt and pepper fries. Man, what an amazing burger! The temperature I chose was medium rare and it was perfectly cooked! The burger was seasoned very well. The short rib was tender and  shredded over the top and offered a sweet element. I loved the smokey taste of the Gruyere which to me, helped to marry all the flavors. This burger was delicious! The fresh fries were also a treat. You could tell they were homemade. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the fries were also seasoned lightly. Great side dish as well!

This burger joint was the perfect way to end our Friday night. It was exactly what we were hoping for: great food at an affordable price. The M Resort has really hit it on the mark with this restaurant. Couple with the Hostile, these are two great reasons to keep coming back! Thank you so much Anthony's, great food which made for a great night!. A very welcome addition to Central Scottsdale, Scottsdale Beer Company so far has proven to be awesome!

I've been there twice since their soft opening on January 3, and I must say I am very impressed.

To put it this way, with independent restaurants that have no existing brand or footprint to have as support, it is up to the owner/developer to create something that works, and that won't fall victim to the statistic of the ever-so-prevalent failed restaurants/bars.  

I think the owners/developers of Scottsdale Beer Company have it right, and I wish them much success.  

When trying out new restaurants over the years, I can tell that sometimes it takes a good amount of time for many places to smooth out the wrinkles and overcome the glitches that can inevitably happen with a new operation.

Well, after these two visits, my experience was absolutely stellar from start to finish.  I have no criticism whatsoever! 

Overall, I found Scottsdale Beer Company to...

...have excellent, attentive service from every employee encountered.  And it wasn't just solid service - everyone went above and beyond to see that the food, drinks, and overall experience was top notch.  You could tell that not only did they hire the right people, that they must have been well-trained to really care about their customers.

...have very tasty food!  The fish and chips were amazing, the blackened fish sandwich scrumptious, and the desserts very good.  My friends seemed to really enjoy their selections too.  Extra points for very nice presentation too, with nice dinnerware, etc.

...good beer!  Granted, their brewery is not at full speed ahead yet, but their guest beers were really nice choices for all tastes.  In most bars around the area, it seems IPAs predominate the "craft beer" taps.  Nothing against IPAs, but they are not my personal favorites.  I tend to gravitate toward Belgian-style beers, porters, stouts, bocks, etc.  In their guest beer list (which changes daily), they had a really nice Belgian quad and Russian imperial porter, both of which were top notch.

...a really nice atmosphere.  It is apparent from all the TVs throughout, that this would be a great place to watch a game.  Additionally, even if it were packed, there is enough spaced to where it wouldn't feel crowded.  The decor has clean lines and feels urban and industrial, which I like.  There was even an artist there chalking up nice designs on their really large chalkboards.  Nice music in the background, but just at the right volume to where everyone can still hear each other.  On nice 75 degree days like today, I would guess the "garage door" style windows they had lining one wall to the outdoor patio could really make the place have an amazing open, airy feel to take advantage of the great Scottsdale weather.

...was impeccably clean.  Granted, it is brand new, but sometimes that doesn't mean anything to some restaurants.  The bathrooms were super clean, as well as everywhere else.

Bottom line, it is not only apparent that the owners here seem to really care about hopefully turning this place into a cash cow success, but they also really seem to care about delivering a fantastic experience to their patrons on all levels (which is the key to that cash cow success!).

I hope that they can keep consistency, and that many subsequent reviews from other Yelpers can exclaim about a great time as well!  Best wishes to Scottsdale Beer Company.  I look forward to returning!. Been to Dona Kay multiple times. Loving it everytime. Great food, great people, great atmosphere. Definitely going back!. I went to the Boulevard Mall today for the first time. The place ain't bad. Everyone says that the Eastside is the bad part of town, but I had no problems. 

I wear Issey Miyake, and it's kind of hard to find the exact cologne I wear. I first went to Macy's but waited a couple of minutes and didn't get any service. After noticing that the workers were just slacking off and ignoring me, I decided that Macy's didn't deserve my business and they could f*ck off.

While I was leaving the mall, I saw "Luxury Perfumes" and noticed that they had just about every  type of Issey Miyake cologne. The girl working there was real friendly and went out of her way to find the exact cologne I was looking for. She literally sprayed me head to toe with over 10 different variations of Issey Miyake. Eventually, we found the one I was looking for and it only cost $63.00. Stuff from Japan is usually far more expensive than that. 

I'm gonna give this place 5-stars all on account of the fact that the girl working here works so hard to make sure every customer leaves satisfied. That kind of work ethic is rare these days, especially in LV.. Reading reviews after eating my sub has me puzzled. The staff is extremely friendly and gave me suggestions having never been here. When I walked in management team of about 7 was having a meeting so it seems they are genuinely interested in making their chain/store better.

I ordered the California Club Mikes Way with no tomato & it was very good. I can't believe other sandwich shops are in business with chains like these. Meat, cheese, lettuce, avacado, etc. all tasted very fresh. I also got a free cookie having it been my first time here :)

One minor complaint is the location of the store. The plaza looks a little run down & could detract from their business.

I would suggest it & would like to see one of these chains in the East Bay. They'd do good business.. Told hostess that i would like to sit on the bar b4 i get a table...hostess  very friendly ( i like to check out the place b4 i order...Bar tender name Nora was very friendly & nice to all counter customers ....

I'ved been to this place a dozen of times &  If you like Mexican Food, This is a Place to Go!!!....Very good, tasty and they have Fresh Tortilla... Service was excellent waitress( Evelyn ) very knowleagable on menu....Great Service all around !!. This is an odd location for amazing thai food. If you don't like it too hot stick with a 1 or maybe a 2 on the hot scale. 3 to 5 might kill you!. very good not off the chart, excellent service, reservation are very prompt. Good food. Got a coupon in the mail and rolled on over. I was hesitant because of a few bad reviews, but the price was right.
Very clean facility with a friendly staff. They even checked my breaks for free. I asked about the bad reviews and they let me know that they were under new management w/ a completely new crew. Nice work!. I just realized I am about to turn the odometer over to 200 reviews!  I feel that Twist is an appropriate selection for this milestone because it was one of the most unique, memorable and enjoyable dining experiences of my life.

I arrived early to enjoy a drink at the bar and ease into my evening.  The moment I walked in I knew this was a special place.  The staff greeted me warmly, as if I was a regular customer and offered me a seat immediately.  I decided to stick to the plan and sit at the bar for a drink first.  As I chatted with the very friendly bartender, I sipped a glass of Louis Roederer Brut and soaked in the beauty of this modern, intimate space.

I was soon escorted to my windowside table.  There is something quite humorous about sitting in such an elegant, sophisticated place and looking out over the sea of neon and confusion that is Vegas.  I barely needed to look at the menu because I knew I wanted to try the tasting menu,  also called Pierre Gagnaire's Spirit. Being a completely politically incorrect glutton I added the Foie Gras Degustation.  More on that later.

At most restaurants, bread is an afterthought.  Not true at Twist.  A server brought out three excellent selections.   A Wheat, Raisin and Walnut, a Country Rye, and a French Ciabatta.  They came with two butters. An unsalted butter from Normandy and one blended with seaweed.  This bread service is second only to the amazing Bread Cart at Restaurant Savoy.

My actual meal started with an "amuse" that consisted of six little bites.  My two favorites were the Salad of Cuttlefish, Haricot Vert, Red Bell Pepper and Celeriac and the Tuna Chantilly with Homemade Rice Crackers.

1st Course
SHELLFISH & RED BEET
Red Beet Carpaccio, Campari, Shellfish Salad "Baltard Market" Soja glazed smoked Eel.

From my first bite I knew I was in for an interesting, confusing, thought provoking evening. The following statement can be applied to all of the courses I had at Twist: I've never experienced this flavor combination before. 

2nd Course
SEA AND EARTH
Santa-Barbara Prawns, Spicy Grapefruit Syrup, Ginger-Potato Salad, Poached Duck Foie Gras, Iberico Ham, Scallop Mousseline, Baby Greens, Eggplant Tuille, Black & Blue Carrot Gelée, Squid Ink Gnocchetti, Seaweed. 

This course, as with most, was actually several small bites presented at once. Each one was fantastic in its own right and also worked together with the others.  

3rd Course
BLACK COD
Grilled Fillet, Poached in Citrus Butter, Molasses-White Balsamic Glaze, Mache, Manchégo Cheese, Asparagus Ice Cream, Green Apple, Paris Mushroom.

One of my favorite courses of the evening. I placed the "ice cream" over the Cod and it turned into a sauce as it melted.  My waiter said he was glad to see me playing with my food.

4th Course
SONOMA VALLEY FOIE GRAS DÉGUSTATION
Terrine, Dried Figs, Toasted Ginger Bread
Custard, Green Lentils, Grilled Zucchini
Seared, Sweet and Sour Duck Glaze, Fruit Marmalade
Croquette, Trevicchio Coulis, Red Onions

This is the singlemost decadent, over the top course I have ever experienced. Each of the small dishes were wonderful.  I found my self rotating between each one, enjoying the different textures and tastes.  My favorites were the Custard and the Seared.

5th Course
HIBISCUS
Hibiscus Gelée, Mascarpone Cream, Malabar Pepper Braised Turnip, Rosé Champagne-Lime Granité.

After the rich Foie course I was happy to see this light palate cleansing course.  Which, like everything else, was unique and different. 

6th Course
GRILLED PRIME SIRLOIN
Stewed Celery-Rhubarb, Pinot Noir Jus, Preserved Shallot. Broccoli Salad, Egg "Mimosa", Red Cabbage Gelée, Bolognaise, Grilled Zucchini, Beef Carpaccio, Black Olive Tapenade.

A perfect piece of beef surrounded by unique and different sides. Have I said that before?

Dessert
Quince Gelée, Bavaroise, Chartreuse Parfait
Nelson Sablé, Meringue, Citrus Sorbet
Cachaça Granité, Cucumber Marmelade, Green Apple
Fruit Biscuit, Seasonal Coulis
Ganache, Ginger, Chocolate Ice Cream

I expected the meal to come to an amazing end and I was not disappointed.  My favorites were the Fruit Biscuit and the Granite. I finished my evening with a gift from the Chef, a plate of Meringues and Cookies.

My experience at Twist was one I will never forget.  I still find myself thinking about it months later.  Twist is a must try for any adventurous food lover.  Hopefully, it won't be a once in a lifetime thing.. Everyone is right, you feel welcome the second you walk in the door.

On to the food... it is really good. I had the Cali burger and it was about as good as it gets. Avocado, grilled onions, and swiss. Two things really stand out here at Da Burger Shack:

1. The buns. They are somewhere between croissant and burger bun. A little flakey, very tender, but hold up to a big burger. Nice!

2. The meat. I don't know how they did it, but they managed to cook a burger to done-ness, and it was still juicy. Now, it was not just oozing, juice. But it was still juicy. Bravo!

I added fries and a drink for a ridiculously small sum. The fries were good, I'm just not a huge fan of the crinkly cut fries. But no complaints. In the drink department, they have many choices. I think there were four choices for lemonades, and two or three teas. I had the "fruit" tea and it was excellent. My sons had the pomegranate lemonade served smoothie style, and loved it.

One note, if you are used to salty food, they don't salt much at Da Burger Shack. THANK  YOU! I don't like salt, and you can add salt to your taste.. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas and it has been that way going on 10 years.  Its got a real neighborhood feel too it.  Food is always fresh and service is super polite and prompt.  I just love to go there after work and take off my shoes and lounge around on the pillows.  I recommend the chicken teriyaki, tempura shrimp and veggies and Japanese sandwiches.. I finally had a Fez burger!  meh.  I went away less than amazed but it was my own fault.  I ordered what was popular rather than what I thought would appeal to my palate.  I had a Fez burger with a side of sweet potato fries.  Both the pears and the bbq sauce were sweet as was the cinnamon on the fries.  For me it was just too much sweet in one dinner.  What I will order next time is a different burger and I was informed I could order the sweet potato fries with just the dipping sauce without the sugar/cinnamon dusting.  And those fries are not the thin soggy ones I had had elsewhere, they are nice and crisp on the outside and stand up quite well on their own.  The burger came out a perfect medium and I did not ask to have it less the cilantro, which I don't care for, so I could have the burger in it's normal form.  I did take the cilantro off the second half.  I happen to like burgers on ciabatta bread so that was fine. 

This visit was sort of spur of the moment.  I had found out where I was meeting folks for a couple of drinks that evening did not serve food and I decided food was in order first.  As I was driving across town on Indian School it didn't take me long to realize how close I would be to Fez!  I got there during the last 1/2 hour of happy hour and the parking lot was packed and I started wondering if I was going to be able to sit anywhere.  I was greeted by Thomas, the GM, almost immediately and he asked what kind of atmosphere I wanted and I explained I was just looking to grab a quick burger on the way to someplace.  He found me a spot in a quiet corner that was perfect.  I had my water right away and my server showed up quickly and took my order.  The wait for the food was reasonable, especially just finishing up happy hour.  My server stopped by on a regular basis and Thomas came by just as I was finishing to hear any comments I had.

I went away happy I had chosen Fez for dinner.. Been eating here for 5 years.  Breakfast and lunch are to kill for. Dinner is so-so,soup has too much salt, and my ankles and hands puff up the next day. The French toast is the bomb....only order the 4 slices. ..portion is very large,and best I've ever eaten world wide. They serve more pancakes than french toast. The selection of eggs Benedict is large,at least 4 different selections. Irish eggs Benedict is corned beef hash ...one of my favorites, German eggs Benedict is potato pancakes on English muffin and topped with the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. 5 stars*****. Cakes and pie and made all day and night long. Always fresh.  Death by dessert  without a doubt. Service is super except Saturday and Sunday mornings between 11-2. Seems like all the church goers head right there. Very similar to New York diners. Been to all 3 locations, this one is a little better.. Great food as always just make sure you go after 6:30pm or before 5 because the "Sun City rush" is insane.  The ribs were amazing.... It's good...for what it is. I had the number 1, the number 7 and the Hallacas, (spelling)? The Hallacas (sp) was delicious, I'm not a fan of raisins and olives so that was my only complaint about it and that it came pre-made so I couldn't get them removed. However, despite my distaste for raisins and olives, it still came out pretty good. The breading they used for the Arepas though was outstanding, I actually could not get enough of that which is why I loved the #1 but also the #7. The #7 was a little more creamier than I thought but the breading had me finish the whole thing. The only real negative about the place as other people have mentioned is that if you go during the summer be prepared to sweat while you eat or at least wait for your food to be finished. However, it's a trade off since melting like Frosty the Snowman will always be tolerable if I can watch a priest, stripper, crackhead, retirees, and a man dressed as Catwoman walk by. (Yes, I typed that correctly, a man dressed as Catwoman, entertaining to say the least) This corner never fails to disappoint.. Love this place. But you guys need wifi for us diners who dine alone.   :). Went here for a birthday dinner and ordered a personal size pizza which was very tasty. Definitely a romantic/date night setting.. If you are in Montreal, don't miss this little hole in the wall. Best dumplings I have eaten.. Brought my girlfriend here and we had an amazing breakfast. The pancakes were the best I've had since I was a kid. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone I know.. Bravo! Clap clap clap. People usually choose between Mineo's and Aiello's in Pittsburgh, and I'm a Mineo's fan! Why? Simple: EXTRA CHEESE. The pizzas are essentially the same to my amateur palate, but Mineo's dumps EXTRA CHEESE onto your pie. The crust is also far superior to Aiello's. Mineo's crust is flavorful, chewy and not dry. The sauce is a little sweet (edge to Aiello's on this one) and I think they must get the cheese from the same seller, because both are deliciously salty, but Mineo's just puts on more. YUM. VOTE MINEO'S AS BEST ZA IN PITTSBURGH :). Tenderloin avocado salad and the Whisky Chicken sandwich are great! So glad we decided to stop in tonight. Our server Bree did a bang up job! We'll see you again soon!. Eating here as a last taste of Vegas before flying home, we only had time for the pre-theater menu.  The restaurant is beautiful, deep black and red, with a decor exclusively created from grains and vegetables in wonderful accents.

The food was delicious, especially the asparagus soup and creme brulee - so light!  The service was impeccable, and the bar seats and open kitchen gave a fun view of the chefs at work.. The herbs with olive oil and bread are amazing!!  Can't go wrong with chicken parm!. This my favorite pub in Phoenix! Good beer selections. Good food (the shepard's pie is amaze-balls, the Irish nachos are epic, and the frickles are delish). They have good live music / entertainment during the evenings. This is a great place to go during the day to hang out with friends, watch a game, have a quiet beer, or have an awesome night out partying. The weekend nights are a raging blast! The staff does a great job handling it all!. Located near Charlotte University City Area. We discovered Cook Out late one night after attending a concert at the nearby Verizon Wireless Amphitheater. It was after midnight on a Saturday night and as I drove by I noticed that Cook Out was really, really busy, that's often a good sign so I flipped a u-turn on Tryon St. and we pulled in to one of two drive-thru windows, since there was no indoor area.

I ordered a "Huge Burger" and upgraded to "Cheddar Style". It turned out to be an excellent choice. A half pound double cheese burger with bacon and grilled onions. It was an excellent burger featuring 2 smaller but thick and tasty patties delivered piping hot. I was surprised that the cheese was a sauce, I believe a good real cheddar would be better, but I still enjoyed it. I also sampled the Hush Puppies, a corn fritter inspired finger food, the Hush Puppies were very good. But the highlight of the late night meal was the "Fancy" strawberry/banana shake, it was just awesome!

I'd recommend Cook Out to good friends as one of my favorite reasonably priced fast food restaurants, especially for late night munchies.. Affordable. Great atmosphere. Bring your own wine. Been there for lunch and dinner. Great family restaurant. Highly recommend large groups looking for a great time.. What a gem!!!! I tried this place for the first time yesterday, and we ended up going back again today!!! The Chicken Schwarma sandwiches are awesome. The hummus is great, and the Chicken Tahook with garlic sauce is going to be the death of me (in a good way)  The food is in expensive (we paid 15 bucks for a chicken tahook plate (great chicken skewers served with pickles, hummus, pita and garlic sauce) a chicken schwarma sandwich, a small lamb meat pie, small cheese pie and a large spinach pie. Needless to say I"m speaking from a bread coma right now, but it's well worth it!! Do yourself a favor, this place is great!. We had an incredible experience celebrating my wife's 50th Birthday at Del Frisco's with family and friends. She loved every aspect of the night to include the venue, food and staff.  If you have never seen the Wine Cellar on the lower level of Del Frisco's ...let me tell you ....it is an absolutely gorgeous setting.  We preset a menu, from which guests could choose their meals. They were all pleased with their food, including lemon cake for dessert.

What really set the night apart was the staff. Natalie the event planner was great with offering suggestions that fit our style and budget...never trying to push one item over another.  Bobby the service lead for our event expertly guided the staff throughout the night. The whole service team was friendly, engaging and responsive to our guests' needs and requests.  We were happy that all of our guests felt like VIPs throughout the evening.

I would definitely recommend Del Frisco's for an exceptional private event.. Very fresh, high quality, good prices. Got the cali tartare roll and tried the chicken teriyaki. Both were delicious. They use real crab in their rolls. AZ VIP and more importantly Dave have always provided the highest level of service in the transportation industry not only in Scottsdale, but anywhere I have traveled.  In the eight + years I have been using them Dave has gone out of his way on multiple occasions to accommodate me and my needs.  AZ VIP is the first call I make when I need a car in the Phoenix area.. Adorable location tucked away in a little cove of shops just south of 5th avenue (if you see the wine bar on the corner, you're on the right track).    Enormous selection of premium loose leaf teas available for individual pot brewed to your liking in the shop, or available by weight for home consumption.  High quality tea accoutrements are sold as well.  Service was quite good.. The place doesn't look like much, but the food is simply amazing. Especially the Greek Pride and green eggs and ham. A must try one of the best sushi places!!!!!  There fish quality is the same and suhsimon and goyemon, we usually go to.  The selection is larger than than other places.  Plating and presentation is very modern.  Service was great and super fast.  We will be back.. One of the newer clubs on the strip located at the Mirage!
If you park in the self-parking lot,  it is conveniently located RIGHT when you get out of the escalators.

My friends had good relations with the promoters here so for our large group of 20 something people, we were comped 2 tables with a bottle at each table. People say this club is small, but what's the point of having a super-sized club? All that does is scatters everyone so  you don't get to meet new people. Here, you have the luxury of the dance floor, your table, the bathrooms, and bars, all within convenient walking proximity so that you don't have to tire your feet out so much. There's also cocktail waitresses walking around giving free shots so be sure to take advantage of that but remember to also leave a tip for courtesy!

The only con about this place is that because our group's tables were separated on the opposite ends of the clubs, we are in a medium size booth that is shared with 2 tables in the booth. Nice waitresses and service. 

Overall, small but I like it. But I can't really agree that this club is 1 of a kind lol.. Solid cocktails, solid atmosphere. I really enjoyed the Great Odin's Raven cocktail. Definitely head this direction if you are downtown.. Been there several time, didn't knew they open a breakfast restaurant in that location. The staff are amazing and very great service. The interior is beautiful with the colours makes you smile. The variety of breakfast and lunch are amazing. Good price and great ambiance.. This was the funniest inner active show I have ever seen.   It was full of audience participation, mystery, great food, and we were even left with a free souvenir. If you are visiting Las Vegas and want an experience that you will never forget THIS IS It!. Food was great! Pita is amazing... Prices are a little high for lunch and the area/parking is not great.. Excellent Italian food for a very reasonable price.  The menu is a collection of simple classics, but the execution is what sets a place like Riccio's apart from the Italian chains.  Terrific service too.  We will be back.. Awhile back two friends and I tried this place as a late-night option.  We were disappointed that they closed at midnight, but the vibe was quite nice, the service excellent, and the music selection was great.  I'm not really into flavored beers much, so I had a pint of the Fresh Squeezed IPA brewed by Deschutes.  It was good so I had another. (I didn't like the sample brought of something else, but the server was good that way to offer a taste.)  My friends were less enthused about their beer selections, but seated at a table we could converse easily in that place.  'Didn't try the food.  The beer selection rotates, so once in awhile it might be worth it to drop in again.... The show was very entertaining.
Great Beatles songs of course.
I found myself wanting more acrobatics.
We sat in 209 row N, great seats.
Probably no bad seats but we were glad we avoided the first 3 rows next to stage.. Get place to hang out on Sunday morning. The staff was super friendly and the Bloody Marys were delicious. Got the BBQ Bacon Burger and a Strawberry Shake. Amazing burger and an awesome shake. Love this place.. Buffet doesn't look like it will be tasty- but all of it is very good. Plus the Garlic Nan bread is the bomb. A real sandwich shop in The Northwest! We stopped by for lunch with high expectations - after reading all of the Yelps. So the bar was set high - and I am happy to say Eddie D's lived up to it's rep! 

They have a pretty good sized menu - We ordered a Pauly walnuts and a Chicago style roast beef. The bread was excellent. Had some body but it wasn't too tough - just right. The roast beef was extra tender. The Aujus with the roast beef sandwich was excellent! 

They definitely use high quality meats and ingredients here. 

They brought out a birthday cake for someone that was eating there. I guess it was a friend or family member. They offered us a piece of cake - very convivial indeed! 

2 sandwiches, 2 chips, 2 drinks was about $25 - a weee pricey...but it was quality food so I would say it was fair!. Let it be known that I am a huge Star Trek fan.  When I was asked earlier this year if I would be interested in going to ST Con 2012, I jumped all over that opportunity.  I sure as hell couldn't convince my parents in the early - mid 90's to drive me to Vegas to meet my favorite actors.  

I have been waiting 20 long years for the opportunity to meet and take pictures with the cast.  There are many elements to ST Con.  You need to keep to your planned itinerary.  Each room you enter needs a current wrist band, which is checked by  "security" personnel.  There is a main room where Q&A's, concerts, etc. can be had.  

There also is a merchandise and photo-op room.  The merchandise is expensive, but where else could you find such a large archive of ST memorabilia.  The merchandise room also holds cast members offering great conversation and autographs/photo-ops for a minimal fee.

  The official photo-ops are pretty damn expensive.  You spend less than 10 seconds taking the picture and you get a small printout the next day.  Mine cost $100 bucks for my buddy and I to have our picture taken with Kate and Robert, but the norm is around 50 bucks.  

I will definitely head back to a Creation convention and ST Con, but next time with more $$$ and a command uniform.. I have entrusted all my cars to Ron and the crew at Accurate. They are always dead on with the diagnosis and care about the customers wallet as well. I have had engine replacement done, transmission, drive shafts, and more. Always prompt and courteous, I recommend them to all my friends that need a good, reliable mechanic.. Had lunch at Maggiano's in the Fashion Show mall. It was a nice setting with an outdoor area. We sat indoors, but we had a great view of the Palazzo hotel. Overall a gorgeous window view.

Ordered the veal scaloppine piccata style and an Arnold Palmer. The veal scallopine was flavorful, especially with the pickled capers that had almost a tangy sensation. There was also spinach placed at the bottom of the veal. It was a light bed of spinach and I felt that I could have benefited with a bit more. The dish came with a side of angel hair. As for the drink, it was just your typical Arnold Palmer, half iced tea half lemonade.

Our server seemed really versed with the various menu items and the ingredients. At first I thought it was only our server and his personality that made him a great host, but after listening in another table it seems all the servers are well-trained and sociable. I applaud the servers for their knowledge and service.

Overall it was a good experience, but not a restaurant of choice since it's a chain. When I am in Vegas, I prefer to dine in locations that are exclusive Vegas restaurants. I feel as though that would add to the experience versus eating at a chain that is readily accessible in my hometown.. Presentation was great, food is great. Price is high but welcome to Vegas. I recommend the onion soup. If you order a baked potato get a smaller steak it a big potato. You can share side dishes with one other person that big. In all very good.. I like hotdogs.  Keeping it real.  What I like about this place in particular is the variety of hot dogs.  Just check out the menu.  The billionaire dog will catch your attention, but the cashier steered me towards the "Funghi" ... Which turned out to be a hot dog topped with mushrooms and truffle mayo and Gruyere cheese.  Reminded me of a pizza.

Unfortunately, they don't have a very large seating area so it's a little hard to get seated and eat.

I suspect one of the hot dogs I ate may have put me in a certain amount of gastrointestinal distress, so I'm gonna have to dock a star for that.  But only one star, because doesn't that come with the territory for any hot dog?  Like I said ... Keeping it real!!!. We had 2 great meals of ahi tuna and blackened talapia . Service & drinks were excellent. It was connected to a golf course & a hotel. We ate in the lounge which was very comfortable and nicely decorated. It was 5 miles west of Casa Grande . We will definitely go back.. My wife and I each ordered a regular size with an extra dipping sauce. This turned out to be more food then I thought, almost enough for a full meal.

The fries were seasoned very well with seasoned salt and came out in just a few minutes. Most of the fries were well cooked but there was an undercooked one or two in my cone. I had the mango and the teriyaki sauces. Both of the sauces were thick white sauces. They both tasted good, but they didn't taste like mango or teriyaki. My wife and I couldn't even agree which was which. The sauces were labeled on top and the one label appeared smudged. I'm curious if we possible got one wrong sauce.  The two sauces my wife got were better, but I don't remember what they were.

The decor was simple, but nice. The tables with the custom holes for your fries are fun and I always enjoy window seating on State, which there is plenty of. 

It's worth the trip and something refreshingly new to town.. I used Pro Check when I moved to Scottsdale. I used a Realtor to rent out a house and since I was unsure of what I was getting into, the landlord allowed me get the home inspected to make sure there were no issues. 

The person who lived in the home before me died many years ago, and the house was vacant...I wanted to make sure nothing weird was going on.

They showed up on time, were pretty thorough, and were pretty friendly. It's not as as exciting as some of my other reviews, but then again, getting your house inspected isn't as exciting as grabbing a bite to eat, now is it?. After a particularly irritating morning, I wrote a WTF flame email to the boss.  Like a good geek, I hit delete instead of send.  My coworkers suggested I leave for a long lunch and get over it.   They suggested Fired Pie.   

A carb coma sounded helpful so I headed over.   Was pleasantly surprised to find thin crust pizza with all the toppings you want.   I tried the chicken pesto with some sun dried tomatoes.   Pretty good pizza that I could have shared or saved some, but didn't.  

Nice comfort food without the carb coma.   As good as Prozac and I'm still employed.. I have been coming to Crisp on and off for a few years and have always been impressed with the quality of meals.  Recently I venture away from the salad menu and started with the wraps.  Very very good.  It's not what I would consider cheap but you do get filled up and sometimes leftovers on the wraps.
The location is cool - they have inside and outside seating.  The service is fast and friendly - you place order - pay and then they bring directly to your table.  The wraps take longer than salads.
Only complaints - parking can be an issue and the noise level of the salad bar work is excessive in my opinion.  They constantly beat the pans and yell orders to back - I get it ... But it's not relaxing.  
That being said I give the food 5 stars.
The ambiance 3
Service a 5 
Which is around a 4 plus.
It's good food.. Get an egg on it.  Yummy.  That it's all.

Really... Just saw that Yelp decided that my review is too short.  What more do you want, people?  It's yummy.  And, put a damn egg on it.

Sheesh.. Tried this new venue and found it to be excellent. Tenders were full of flavor and juicy. Staff is well trained and decor is superb. We will be making this place a regular stop. New favorite spot for quick and healthy food. The best eggwhite burrito and protein shake.  eat here 5 times a week, and I notice that the drive thru line is getting longer.  no longer a secret, the word is out about Dlish.  

have not tried the dinner menu, but will soon.  Some great dishes.. Went for lunch on a Monday with very low expectations but was wowed by the ambience and good food. Fantastic.. Hands down a great place to go 
Egg drop soup wonderful
Lady behind counter was exquisite!!!!!!!!!!
Go back in a heartbeat!!!!!. Great restaurant that deserves a better location!  But don't ever go too far away!  Best little Italian gem on n. Tatum.. Went there for lunch.  Using my free birthday sub coupon.  I used to go to Togo's in California.  I ordered a pastrami sub.  Taking me back to the old days.  The sub was very tasteful and the bread was soft.  I will continue to come back.. Great service, fresh and amazing food all for a great price.  What a gem. Hands down. Best BBQ in Montreal. Ambience, food, service, price, bars, neighbourhood... Well done guys!!. My review is for my experience on 04/26/13.  I was in Phoenix to celebrate my 50th birthday in my birth town and decided to have lunch at Alice Cooper'stown. Overall I had an awesome experience.

 I like how the women get into the theme, with cutoff denim shorts, black tanks and tees and AC eye makeup. Everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful but I want to make a special shout out to Susie. She took outstanding care of me. I decided to go with the tuna casserole based on her suggestion/recommendation...it was wonderful: creamy, great flavor, not fishy smelling or tasting. Onion rings would have been a great side (hint hint). I wasn't familiar with Kilt Lifter and she gave me a sample with my Hefe. It was so good I had two full glasses. Susie was attentive without being overbearing AND invited me to walk around to check out the memorabilia. Good waitress/bartender she is, she gave me a covered cup of water to keep me hydrated.

I especially liked the decor - a combination of music and sports memorabilia with lots of Alice Cooper influence.  The music totally ROCKED.  The restaurant also has a nice selection of tshirts and sweatshirts for sale. Maybe a bit overpriced but hey! they're in business to make money.

Here's a tip: go at lunch. I'm sure the dinner crowd is exactly that - a crowd. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'm definitely going back. Thanks Susie for taking care of me!!. With its finely appointed decor resembling a pub straight out of Dublin, the Skeptical Chymist is a visual funhouse, offering sanctuary to the pub-goer looking for something different. 

A large chalkboard behind the bar lists a wide variety of handcrafted brews with alcohol contents ranging from five, to the much higher ten percent range typically found in double IPA's. I'm pleasantly surprised with each visit to see the constantly changing offerings. 

Their happy hour menu features five dollar flatbreads that are absolutely scrumptious. But the piece de resistance is their corned beef and cabbage; a true delight with its perfectly cooked cabbage and  generous portion of corned beef slathered in a mustard onion demi-glace. 

Kudos to our server who was quick to forewarn how the dish comes with a 'gravy', for had she not done so, I'm certain I would have been repulsed upon seeing my corned beef smothered in a brown gravy. 
At first, we were both confused, our thoughts swimming around the idea of how gravy could add anything to corned beef. But this gravy is different. 
They call it gravy, but it's an onion based demi glace with a slight hint of deli mustard which if you can believe, accents the corned beef into a culinary triumph.

One IPA, and a plate of corned beef for lunch and I found myself flat on the couch an hour later, sleeping Sunday afternoon away like a newborn, as Sundays are meant to be.

During the week, the Chymist is a fun retreat from work, with its all ages crowd, cigar-friendly patio, and extremely fair happy hour prices.
The Chymist is a great place to unwind, or, have a fine meal that in no way resembles typical bar food. 
 
I should probably mention how I've yet to find an unfriendly server or slow service. 
That's not to say the service is somewhat slower when packed, but if you're there to pound brews instead of enjoying the moment, you'll likely disagree with this review.

Overall, nice job SC management.. Wow !  Tout à fait excellent. Très bel endroit. Ambiance chic / décontractée. Chaude recommandation !. 4 people were all very happy.  Lots of mixed drinks, good food, mac and cheese is amazing, and a reasonable selection of various micro beer choices.. This was a chance to spend time with a great customer and everything was excellent.

Thanks for taking such good care of us and making for a very enjoyable dinner.. What a pure pleasure! Gorgeous setting, beautifully re-done, probably THE BEST hotel experience EVER! And I've stayed with "all of them"  EVERYWHERE!!  

The gym, the pool, the staff, EVEN THE COFFEE is a total winner!

And how 'bout that bathroom!!

Can't wait to go back. This is quickly becoming one of my favorite coffee shops in Pittsburgh. Comfortable and friendly place to spend an afternoon. I haven't met a latte here I didn't like, and as Adam K. wrote adding a flavor to your drink is a great idea. Also, their mochas are definitely worth a try: rich, and just sweet enough. Drinks are moderately priced as compared to what you might pay elsewhere. As Alexis B. wrote, you might not get as large a portion for your money as you'd like, but the quality makes it well worth a weekly trip in my book. That being said, my mug is almost always filled to the brim -- appreciated, but getting back to your seat without spilling requires a bit of finagling, especially with a line of customers to navigate around. It's a shame to mess up the latte art, too! 

On that note, a word about the staff: very friendly and always ready to clarify your questions or to make a suggestion. I remember one experience in particular, when a barista spilled a bit of my mocha as he was making it. Considering that we had been talking while he was working and that the mug was essentially full, I didn't mind all that much, but after I'd sat down he brought be a complimentary refill. I'd call that pretty decent customer service.

This place has almost always been pretty full when I've been there, and I wouldn't say its for cramped space or a lack of seats either. On the other hand one of the small niceties that first attracted me to commonplace was the fact that the name isn't just that -- customers are subtly encouraged to get acquainted with one another. To the far left side of the bar next to the "share a table, I dare you" sign are a couple placards ("table share is go", for example) that add a nice touch. I like having my own island in a public space as much as the next person, but for me the placards are an opening to conversations with some fellow patrons.. The Cambria is really nice and I have always enjoyed staying here.  The lobby area is spacious and open and the restaurant/bar area is well laid out.  Pool is small but nice and clean and I find the people who work here nice and inviting.  Rooms are suites complete with two flat panel TV
S, microwave and frig.  Beds are comfortable and housekeeping is timely and complete.  Wi-fi was slow at times especially using my Apple TV.  Parking is a bit of a pain at times but all in all this a nice property.  Breakfast buffet is average but satisfying.. I had the  Mi Quan the last time I was here.  Several Yelpers said it was good so I had to try it.  They were right, it was very good.  The beef broth was rich and flavorful.  I also have had the chicken too and loved it.   Their Pho Ga is also very good.  I liked it better than their regular Pho.   The vermicelli was also tasty.  They will make it with chicken if you ask.  I wish I could find a place that grilled the meat over a live flame though.  The prices are very good for what you get.  

They recently remodeled the place and that was why it was closed briefly.  They took away the karaoke stage and made more room for tables.  They were still working on the other side of the restaurant but it was hidden from view so I don't know what was going on there yet... ADOBO FRIED RICE OMELETTE! Yum!

This is a local favorite somewhat off the strip, but their adobo fried rice omelette is worth coming here for after a night or early morning partying on the strip. They have a karaoke bar attached next door for all you drunkard songbirds. 

Definitely a local hotspot after hours. And the two siblings that work there are hella cool too!. Erika was so nice and handled our large rowdy table of 12 like a boss!  The beer list and menu rocked. I'm still salivating over those pork sliders and Mac n cheese.. I just finished eating at this Korean restaurant and it was delicious! The moment I walked in it was very clean and eye opening. It is centrally located so it is perfect for anyone looking for a good BBQ place. Even though there were only two servers tonight they did a pretty good job overall. It started to get packed as the evening went on so I knew that this place was good. I tried a lot of things actually: prime kalbi, bulgogi, pork belly, oysters, miso soup, and even dessert. I wish I could have tried everything but I will save that for the next time I will be there. I even have a feeling that the owner/manager was out and about seating customers, smiling, and making people feel comfortable and right at home. To top it off, they have a projector screen on the wall to provide a little entertainment while you are cooking or enjoying your food. My server, Kristin, was very nice, polite, and outgoing. She really took care of me, always asked if everything was okay, and making sure I was never thirsty. How can you get better than that? I would recommend Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining to anyone who wishes to have great food, great service, and very reasonable prices.. Wow!!! Been here twice now. First time was my wife and myself, second time 7 of us in the family. Couldn't wait to show the others what we had found. For a total of 9 different , custom made pizzas. Every person said theirs was delicious. Perfectly cooked, just the right size for one person (maybe one slice too big!).. played a round here with my lifelong buddies.   in tip-top shape as expected.   too bad my game is in sad shape or I would have enjoyed it more.. The staff is very nice and knowledgable :) I have a mail box here and I love how this post office stays open 24-7. I found that to be a huge plus!. Had a fantastic time here this afternoon. It was lucky that we arrived right before the lunch rush! Oren was super friendly and handed out samples of the delicious hot links while we were waiting. I ordered a platter with the pulled pork and beef brisket. The pork was scrumptious, but the brisket was my favorite -- tender and juicy. Naked BBQ doesn't cover its meats, so the food didn't come slathered in sauce; I added some sweet sauce and vinegar as desired (they also have spicy and mustard varieties). The cornbread muffin and maple bacon donut were a perfect dessert to finish the meal. Ambience is laid back and decor is rustic without being corny. Great neighborhood eatery. Will definitely be back soon!. In a nutshell, DO IT!  I've been to plenty of buffets in Vegas and I was really surprised with the great quality and the vast variety of food of the Bacchanal Buffet.  Make sure you recon the buffet areas first and prioritize the locations that have the food that you want.  Don't forget to hit the high value targets (seafood, sashimi, crab legs, steak, prime rib, desserts, etc.).  I was surprised that when I went back for seconds, the kitchen had swapped some of the menu items for other great looking food, so it was hard to keep track of all the different stations that I wanted to go to.  My group ate heartily and we all agreed this is one of the best buffets to go to while in Vegas.  We didn't even have to battle the other patrons for the monster Alaskan crab legs or for the other expensive seafood items.  Even with a graduated price scale that correlates to time of day and day of the week, the most expensive time slot (weekend dinners) is well worth the price and experience.. Omg! 24 hour delivery! This is a great idea. I love to come here for the poutines! They are just amazing, especially the smoke meat poutine, it's to die for.

The restaurant looks like a mom and pop place with the checkered red and with tables. The pizza is great has well and not expensive. Sometimes service is slow because bar/club hoppers go here at 2-5am to eat. It does get intense but that's how you know it's great food,. I love supporting individual owners and chefs. James sure does it right! Jerk chicken, beef with kimchi, basic beef with cheese...all good, all the time, every time.. Fern is a lovely little restaurant with an intimate and charming atmosphere. The atmosphere was planned very well, right down to the silverware. There is also a nice little patio area with a roof.

All their food is vegetarian and most can be made vegan by request. They have a rather small menu, however the items on there have all be delicious every time. They also have a decent beer and wine selection.

The wait staff are very nice people. They are not only attentive but personable as well. Fern is a lovely place to visit or go for a date.. The staff is always friendly and chipper in the morning.  Bagel and Iced Tea always done to perfection.  Wish it had longer hours.. We had a great time at Gina'a Bistro. Ricardo the owner was also our server since we ate very early at 4pm and no one was there yet. He is from Italy and did a great job taking care of us on every level. We all started with a house salad which was fresh and had a nice hint of garlic in the dressing. My inlaws and wife had the salmon steak with shrimp for their entree. They all commented how wonderful the flavors were. I tasted a bit of my wife's dish and it had a fresh ocean like flavor in the sauce, perfectly done. I had my old favorite chicken parm which was outstanding. You can tell the chef knows what he is doing as the chicken breasts were thin and tenderized so they just melted in your mouth with an excellent tomato sauce. 

For dessert we had tiramisu which was so light and decadent with a hint of amaretto. Mom had the cannoli which I got a taste of and it was excellent. This place is a hidden gem in the dessert. Highly recommended.. What egg shortage?  I think every single menu entree had a minimum of 4 eggs.  Come with an appetite because the breakfast portions are huge.  I usually come after skating at the ice rink around the corner and it always hits the spot.  Great value for great tasting quality food, esp with a groupon deal.  Roman took great care of us, checking in on us several times even though it was peak brunch time.. The food here was great!  A lot of options on the menu (some might even say overwhelming) but everything we got was delicious.

Went with the Chicken Curry, Bombay Aloo, and Dall.  Their Naan is delicious!. What a fantastic little spot in old Montreal. This was suggested to us by our lawyer. And not knowing if she was a foodie or not I was hesitant. Well DAMN! Just the Caprese Salad alone insured my return. Perfect balance of cheese and tomato versus the tangy dressing... just perfect. Followed by dipping some bread in to soak in the left over dressing in the bowl. I had the lasagna - for some reason I just wanted one - and it was very very good but no where near the Coq au Vin my girlfriend had which was just amazing, the chicken was served with delicious pasta sauced only with the drippings from the Coq au Vin and served with grilled veggies. And the pastries are from one of the best pastry shops in Montreal...if not Québec, Alati's in Little Italy.

The service needs a little finesse considering the type of clientele that eats there but it doesn't seem to bother the patrons that left no chair free, the place was packed and for a good reason. The food is simply awesome. For a trattoria, they make pretty upscale grub and that's fine with me.. I used to like this place, but Wolfley's has now become Majerle's.... Food is good but way understaffed at lunchtime. Celebrated my sis in law's birthday here and we had a very good experience. I had been craving for laksa, and this place serve them so we thought of giving them a try. Iam very pleased to have tried this place. Their laksa is very good! Comparable to those i have had in singapore. We also got some stir fry noodles and they were awesome. In short, this place has good food and good ambience. I secretly asked Gina(their staff that day) if i can buy a dessert and have them put a candle on top of it for my sister in law and she said she would do it for free! Awesome! She's very sweet. The dessert we got was a sorbet topped with fruits and it was the bomb. They even sang happy birthday to my sister in law. If ever im in vegas again, im definitely coming back.. If it Winghart's is not the best burger place in Pittsburgh it is certainly very competitive. The service has been extremely friendly and helpful each time I have been there. It feels a little less corporate than BRGR. I got the feeling that the people who work there really like working there. Probably because all three times they brought it up how it is such a great place to work. It's cool to see a place where people like what they do.. We had a great meal. The restaurant excelled in all categories I.e. ambience, service, food, and location.. Came here last night and I have heard a lot about this place! I am a huge fan of open table and last night I was looking to make a reservation and did just that once I saw that at the specific timeframe I was looking for was awarding 1,000 pts! Once arrived were were greeted by at first the bartender and then the host finally arrived and seated us! The service was great! The ambiance of the place is definitely a bit dark/romantic I guess? But I literally had to use the light on my phone to read the menu! Ordered the hot wings for an appetizer and the Salmon dish for the main dish! The food was nothing short of amazing! I can alway appreciate a Well prepared Salmon dish! I will return one of these days so I can see how good the steaks are! Oh and the last word cocktail was very refreshing ;-). You can't beat a Saturday brunch with outstanding food and a view of the Strip.. This place was awesome great job on cleaning and waxing the car. Chris did a great job from beginning to end!. This is a great location for Dalia's organization, the staff there is fantastic always really friendly and remember my name and my Golden doodle "Baxter" name also, and they all act like it is "Not my fault" that they work there, but their privilege to help us who bring our things into them for cleaning.
Thanks Dalia for having such a GREAT CREW AT THIS LOCATION.
Larry C. Went for a late afternoon matinee. The theatre is kind of small so if your looking to sit far away from people, you better hope nobody shows up for your movie. The sound system is great and that is a plus in drowning out people trying to figure out what to order halfway through the flick. You should sat as far as you can from the entrance near the other side of the wall so the servers don't disturb you 100% of the time. I didn't use the button because if you get into the movie early, they will just come over and take your order. I got a draft beer for about 5 bucks and change after tax and I sat in the non office chair seats. Nobody sat in those, so I'm not sure why they are still there. Still old fashioned and want dinner and a movie, but will try some coconut fingers next time at least for the novelty factor.. A Sunnyslope landmark and I am not exaggerating. This place has been here for as long as I can remember and the service has remained top notch. I have bought and sold a few bikes here over the years and have never been done wrong. Bought a bike today and was impressed with the fact that the guy didn't even try to up sell me at all. He gave me suggestions based off what I said I was looking for,let me try a few bikes out in the parking lot and when I chose my new ride proceeded to make adjustments to the handle bars and seat which magically made the bike fit me like a glove. This is truly a great place to buy a bike, support local businesses and honest businesses by buying here.. I would give the food a 4 star and the service seems to be slipping. The specials have some stipulations and never meet up with the sales pitch. The food is still very good and if you don't mind spending the money it is worth it.. I drove by this place a few times when it was still a "coming soon"... and I'm glad I finally stopped in!  

Refuge's exposed brick walls and finished concrete floors provide a cool modern look in a chill, comfortable, and relaxing environment.

The barristas/staff all seem friendly and knowledgeable and it's actually a fairly bustling place for having been open a relatively short period of time.

For food, I have only tried the prosciutto bruschetta... and for $3 it was good, but small (two pieces), but it definitely hit the spot!

Cupcakes are the standard make-at-home size, but only $2.  I will be sure to try them.  Today's special cupcake was a gingerbread cupcake with crushed ginger and raisins... and it was a larger size, but still only $2!

Wifi + espresso + cheap eats = me coming back again and again!. This is the closest Roberto's to my office and it's fairly similar to every other Roberto's in town. It's not the nicest one in terms of decor, but I doubt you go to Roberto's for the interior decorating. The menu and pricing is exactly the same as every Roberto's in Vegas. The one thing to note is that there is no bathroom available to customers. For a dine in restaurant, that's quite odd. You may need to wash your hands before eating, but you won't be able to here. And considering this is Mexican food, you may need to hit up the bathroom immediately after eating, but you won't be able to here.. Wow what a change! I went in for lunch today for the first time in over a year, come to find out the entire place had recently been remodeled. It looks great! Much more inviting and pleasant! 

The bartender; a white male, probably in his twenties was very attentive and fast. Also suggested what they call "wing bar". Unlimited wings at lunch time for 11 bucks! Sounded good to me, and the wings turned out well. It also featured salad and soup. 

Service was great, food was good, so I'll definitely be back!. I have been to Vegas many times and I would usually go to "The Gun Store". However, I saw this place advertised and decided to give it a try. I took my office so I decided to splurge and get the VIP package. I was truly impressed as soon as we entered. This facility is very spacious, clean, and the staff is very friendly. The VIP range is great!!! There is a lot of room and they truly make sure you are comfortable. Our range master was fantastic. I was the only guy with four women. He was extremely professional and made sure everyone was first safe and then felt comfortable about the firearms we shot. My wife even fired the shot gun.  If you have never shot before this is the place to go. I definitely got more for my dollar at this facility compared to the Gun Store, I will definitely be going back!!!. What a great find! Flew in for business and ashamed to say my GPS was taking me to Fuddruckers in Waterfront. Little did I know that when I got there it was out of business with no sign it had ever been there. So, I parked and started to walk around the shops and ran across BURGATORY. Man on man am I ashamed to have ever looked for the F place. BURGATORY is the bomb! I ordered the bison, cooked pink with buffalo gouda, lettuce tomatoes, red onions and side of creamy horseradish. It was heaven on a bun. Got a side of the fries and cole slaw. Everything was fantastic and I'm already looking forward to my next trip to Pittsburgh.. First time here andc the food was awesome.   Honey walnut shrimp, pad thai, and peppersteak were delicious.  Steak was tender.  Everything was very flavorful.  A little pricy but the quality was worth it.. Amazing offering of authentic Thai dishes, great service, nice ambience.  Checkout the Crazy Crab Puffs and Spicy Catfish-Mmmmmm!. nice place, good pricing.. To keep this simple. At Saborr you get your money worths. Great portions at cheap prices. Great staff plus military discount.. I travel to Las Vegas often for work related events - my time often centered in the Strip area for meals, drinks etc.  I read about the Downtown project in Wired & wanted to have some time in this district.  I selected 'Park' for dinner - I found it an amazing refuge.   It was personal, reasonably priced, chill environment - it seemed to represent the best of old (downtown) and new Vegas.  I  highly recommend this place for dinner/drinks - and believe this area is worthwhile to escape the 'too much' strip.. Great local hole in the wall. Staff is always friendly. I'm not huge on their sea food but their carne asada is amazing! I usually stop in for a breakfast burrito or breakfast dish (which are all very reasonably priced) or grab the 9 carne asada taco platter and save some for leftovers. Make sure you try out their salsas when you go in. For me at least, the salsa is what makes the food. Been going here regularly for over 6 years. I have yet to take someone there that didn't want to go back.. Formerly Mama Fu's, the Improper Pig throws it's hat in the ring filled with many hats regarding BBQ in Charlotte. 

Cool atmosphere, great service. Owner came by and made sure everything was good. 

Food - wife loved her pulled chicken with sweet potato hash and coleslaw. I liked, hot loved, my pulled pork, but really enjoyed the creamy man-and-cheese and sweet potato waffle fries. They killed it on the sides. Also came with a jalapeño corn bread slice. They also have 6 different sauces so I poured it on.

Will be back, I want to try that pulled chicken my wife is raving about. I did improper things to that macaroni though.. The storefront and location are unassuming but walk in to find a sleek and modern setup. You won't find any of the typical labels here. Want Nike, Ray-Ban, Prada, Gucci? This isn't your store. Instead, you'll be shown several incredibly sexy, unique brands with different frames and materials to match your face shape, fashion interests, and budget (although tbh, the prices can get quite high for several options).  

Even better than the selection, the team here is fantastic. I've been having regular eye exams and swapping out new rims/contacts for over 20 years. Brian and Dr. Angela truly make the experience. They are patient and offer their honest opinion on how different frames suit you. I really appreciate their no-pressure customer service and they were not annoyed with me trying on every frame in the store. Such a relief when compared to some other offices obviously just trying to maximize profits.

Definitely check them out for your ocular needs. I didn't even need new glasses...I recently did Lasik (not perfectly corrected, still some astigmatism) but still had vision credit from my insurance to use up. Glad I did so here!. Good Thai place. I've had better but this is definitely worth going if you're in the area.. My girlfriend and I booked a two hour trail ride yesterday. Debbie took use out into the White Tank Mt. foothills. She was a wonderful guide. Sparkles and Traveler were great horses to ride. The ride was interesting, fun and extremely enjoyable. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to see the desert from a different perspective.. My friend and I stopped in for 2 slices and breadsticks w/ sauce.  FYI - The marinara sauce for breadsticks has hot sauce in it.

Great selection of flavor combinations.  Not too much cheese or other condiments on each slice. Perfectly cooked, where even the noodles on a slice were perfectly cooked just past al-dente.

The State Street location also comes with a lot of interior ambiance.. Excellent neighborhood spot with outstanding food, large portions and reasonable price. The staff make you feel special and I have not made a bad menu choice. Try the wings with sauce on the side or the Monday night fried chicken. Lunch or dinner, Wallys receives 5 stars from me.. We had a group of folks who had a reservation here. We were seated quickly on the patio and got some amazing seats. This steakhouse has excellent menu items and I would recommend it to others. I had classic steak which was amazing. The fries are excellent and to top it off the chocolate mousse was yummy.. Stopped in for a refresher and do a quick check out thinking I may return for food next day. Stayed for the evening.

I sat at the bar and had 1/2 dozen oysters & the Quebec cheese plate. Different combo for sure, especially considering it was accompanied with a double Hendrik's gin martini. Long story .,

All very good!

The oysters were fresh and delicious and came with a sauce that was original and delightful. The cheese plate was meant for sharing so I got to gorge a little. Very nice selection with fresh firm seedless red grapes on the vine and some greens with apple slices and a chutney. The chutney was very good too. If you do order this combo spill a trace of the oyster sauce on the greens. Great spot. They made no mistakes and the Brie was exceptional.. Not sure why this place has been getting a bad rep... We have been cing since they opened up last year and are always pleased. I'm sure it may have taken a bit to get a new store working smoothly buy we're happy to finally have one near us in NW Mesa.. Wonderful. I was here at a company dinner. Kudos to the kitchen for puiling off a fantastic meal for over 100 people. It was pretty much a fixed menu, we got to select our entree (meat or fish) and dessert.
We were all served the lobster pie. It was great and after the lobster pot pie and salad I was content. I then had halibut which was perfectly cooked and fantastic.
Closed the night with the famous root beer float.
Nice dining room and great service. I look forward to returning and then will have the opportunity to sample more of the menu!. The decor, staff and food all "on fleek". The breakfast biscuit is unreal and the red velvet waffle and chicken was dope. Must stop in.. I come here fairly often with my family when we're hungry for good italian food. I've tried a lot of the dishes - specials, pastas, pizzas, etc. though being a simple guy I do end up getting the chicken parm a good percentage of the time. Always tasty, super cheesy, with a nice sauce. The staff is friendly and remembers you, dine in service is nice and they're good about carry-out orders and always make sure you walk out with a side of bread with your order too. My Mom, who uses penne bolognese as her dish standard for comparing italian restaurants likes Nick's the best in the area. A good spot for sure, wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a friend.. This is probably my favorite place to go to do 80% of my drinking in champaign. It's chill and out of the way but interesting people show up. 

The ownership knows what their doing as well as service is always quick to serve and quick to help. 

How awesome is it to feel a good party mood yet ALSO be able to talk to someone!?. I feel very welcomed and enjoy the service every time I visit. My friend who requires a Gluten Free diet also loves it. 

The food is excellent and choices are plenty!. Great pizza and wings place! Everytime I come here, its always good food. Love Balboa!. If you live out here in Phoenix there are a number of good BBQ places, many of which have a strongly Southern focus on BBQ pork, specifically ribs and pulled pork with the meat served already mixed with or covered in sauce. Texas BBQ, at least from my own personal experience (born in Texas and raised there till I was twelve and moved to Hawaii, which has a very different type of BBQ), is generally dry rubbed and smoked and any sauce is put on after you get your meal, at your discretion, and of course, thanks to the bountiful supply of cattle in the early years of the state there is a strong focus on beef BBQ and in addition, thanks to the many German settlers, it is also known for some great smoked sausage (in fact, if you find yourself in Corpus Christie take a drive out and go to Orange Grove, a small town, at least when I was there 20 years ago that is very German and wow, the sausage, but that is another story).

Well, this place, based on the BBQ brisket (always my ultimate test of Texas BBQ) makes some great BBQ and even better, it has the bare bones approach to cost that is standard in many little Texas BBQ joints and many great food hole in the wall places in general. It's not in, to say the least, the fancy part of town, all transactions are done in cash so leave your credit card at home, and the meal is provided on an empty soda crate bottom sort of thing with a piece of butcher paper on it and then the sliced meat of your choice is on another piece of butcher paper and when they ask how many slices of bread you want, and you reply, they reach into the drawer below the cash register, rip open a loaf of sliced Wonder Bread (or the equivalent) and give you that to make the traditional folded sandwich of sliced meat and BBQ sauce on bread. You can also get a sandwich special but I'm a traditionalist, I'll make my own.

In addition, I have an obsession with potato salad at BBQ places (once again, an offshoot of the German influence, I would think, on Texas BBQ cuisine and boy, the potato salad here is classic potato salad. Oh, and to drink, if you are off work, they do have Shiner Bock, in the bottle, along with a number of other beers and if you look up the Shiner brewery website, you will once again, see the strong German influence and one thing that I don't think is German, but definitely Texas, Country Music on the sound track.

Now, for those looking for a luxury experience, you may need to go to Joe's BBQ, which two of my 3 dining companions said they liked better (the whole slices of Wonder Bread did not excite them, but one of the people, along with me, was sold on this place....it is VERY authentic Texas hole-in-the-wall BBQ and it does that well and if you are looking for something other than the no-frills approach to the BBQ experience, then some other place may be more to your liking.. I have always had good service and good to excellent food at any Zipps location.  BUT if you want a burger that is absolutely delicious and cooked just right this is the place!! My favorite burger is the green chili cheese burger which comes with 2 beef patties and is guaranteed to be so juicy that it will drip down the front of your shirt (happens to me all the time!!!!) 

And, if you are chicken wing "aficionado" you can go mild to smoking hot but also try their dry wings (my choice). 

The place can get a little noisy particularly in the evenings and some of their locations are worse than others. I don't think acoustics is big priority when they set up their restaurants so if you don't mind hearing all of the conversations that are going on at the same time or are half deaf (that what my wife says) then it won't bother you!! 
           
So ....... in conclusion, at least 4-stars and if you want to dribble hamburger juice down the front of your shirt, this is the place!!!. I found out about this place through friends.  Frankly I don't like gambling, but I love the buffets.  Now with this club I can just go play my heart out then go eat good food!! Yay!  The staff are friendly and the coaches are real pros with scary smashes.  The ceiling is high enough for even the pros to do high clears!  They recently added tournament quality mats too!  If I'm waiting I can chill in the break room and play with their PS3.  I love this place ha ha!. ... as always, 5 stars if the place would stand up anywhere. It would. 

Firstly, I'm overjoyed it survived these past few years. Secondly, on a regular Saturday night 8:30-ish, it was 40% full - and in-line with it's 2 street-facing co-tenants. That's hopefully enough to ensure survival. These 3 delightful restaurant/bars have carved out a wonderful second life for the industrial building they're housed in and provide a luxury of urbanity to this burg. 

We had to scoot in for a quick small supper before going to a comedy show a friend was in. Small check quickly and un-resentfully served - thank you gracious server! 

There was a single man drinking a coke and eating a bowl of pasta at the bar while diligently reading his book. It was clear he felt abundantly welcomed. That tableau epitomizes the civilized urbane establishment this place is. 

The pasta carbonara remains true after two years to the unremittingly high standard set for me by a Queens neighborhood Italian joint decades ago - and Pasta Bar remains the only other place I've ever ordered it more than once. For that, and so much more, I'm eternally grateful.. I highly recommend this place if you are hungry for a traditional slice of fantastic piZza!   We came in on a whim from gambling and we were delighted!  The manager Amanda even let us taste the meatballs because she highly recommended them and oh my god do they rock!  This is the place where great nights end!  The bartender Kate is exceptional!   You should only come in when she is in!  Don't even try to fight it!. The restaurant looked promising when we sat down. The terrase looked cute and was really energetic. The menu was expansive and they had a special "Menu du jour" with an extra selection of plates. 

I went with a simple spaghetti pomodoro and my dining parter went for the Tortellinni a la gigi. The  food came to us quickly which was great! 

The portion was the perfect size and had lovely garnishes on them. Overall the food was really good. Classic Italian fare - flavourful but not really memorable. The dining experience was good and I would recommend the resto!. This is a nice place for lunch. The whole table shared a lot of food. We had a variety of foods, from different styles of fried rice and noodles to wonton soup and crispy shrimp rolls. Everything was very tasty. Although the food was great, I would of liked it to be a little cheaper as I felt I was overpaying for my lunch.. I had my vegas moment here.  We had 9:30 reservations at Mon Ami Gabi, and we arrived at 9pm and were able to immediatly be seated outside on the patio with a table against the railing and were able to both sit so wer could watch the amazing views of the strip and the bellagio water show.  Our waiter, Chris, was there and attentive with a warm bagguette and a carrot salad that my girlfriend loved, I only got one bite.  Next Chris suggested a bottle of wine which was perfect.  We started with Duck Confit, which was amazing the tastes and textures were unbelievable.  We both ordered steaks which were perfect.  Here you can order the cut of meat then any of the sauces you want, these steaks were great.  and the frittes cannot be described you need to have these.

We were not rushed through our meal, nor did we wait on any of the courses, Chris kept our wine glasses full and was very nice.  We savored our meal for 2 hours as we watched the bellagio water show 5 or 6 times, and the river of people on the sidewalk would be worth it to watch anytime.  

This is hands down my favorite resturaunt on the strip, it is perfect

oh and it was a little windy last night but the angles of the building and the heaters made it just fine to wear a short sleeved shirt.. My first experience with Cornish Pasty Company was over at a friends house, she had ordered the not done ones that you bake at home...I did not have very high expectations, I was thinking something like hot pocket quality...boy was I wrong! Even baking them at home they were fantastic! I had to go and see what it was like in the actual restaurant! I have been many times.. Amazing.. Simply fantastic. Not a huge menu, but it is quite diverse with both raw fish and traditional Italian cuisine. 

You can order each item as an entree or combine several (3 for $30, 4 for $40...yes, you get the idea). My date and I ordered three each, and the chef prepared them one at a time, allowing us to enjoy each dish. It really gave us an opportunity to eat at casual pace without the tastes of each dish interfering with one another. 

The veal and the risotto were phenomenal!

Not a big desert connoisseur, but if available, try the cake soaked in olive oil.  Great ending to a great meal.. Quaint sushi restaurant in Vegas.  Good food and great customer service!  Don't forget to ask for Annabel!!. Excellent steakhouse. The butcher's cut is one of the tastiest steaks I have ever had. Highly recommend this place!. Pamela's is kingly diner food. When I'm back in the Burgh, this one of my favorite spots. 

- Atmosphere and decor is a cool, '50s Americana-style
- Great diner breakfast: pancakes, french toast, bacon, coffee, etc
- Line can be long on the weekend, which is a testament to how good it is
- Been here dozens of times, never had an issue with the staff. Emaied the store with some questions. ... got a quick friendly response, from Adam, with good advice.

Never had anything repaired. 
Seems very service oriented. 

I've bookmarked the for future use.. I found Marshall's in 2005 though the "mechanics file" section of the "car talk" website.  I have never been disappointed with their work - ultimate professionals, timely and when you can't be without your car they will do a rental for you - right on site (though they run low on rentals when it's 'snow bird' season).  No weird pressure or up-sells - just honest business.  That said, they're busy - so an appointment always helps.. Great food and beer!!. great place! I'm so glad I found it... I had rice with stuffed zucchini and meat balls, it was delicious and even though I ate there by myself the food was enough even for two people.
The place is nice and clean and you feel like eating at home.
definitely going back for some fricassee next time, the traditional tunisian sandwich i bet it's really good.. Good food, lots to pick from on buffet.  Great for the kids.. I had Bianca for make up and Daileny for hair and they were fab!!! Bianca worked her magic n covered my face wax incident! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! fab girls!!! They gave the look I loved n my makeup stayed on alllllll night!!! I have oily skin n Bianca n daileny did a great job!. I really enjoy eating here. Staff is super friendly and it's very clean. The food is good.  I would recommend to anyone.. For a convenience store / gas station I think they have the service and product right.  Kwik Trip always excels in customer service and quality of fresh food.  Their employees earn more that their counterparts at their competitors, have better benefits and are treated well by management if they perform.

I will often shop with a social conscious and Kwik Trip is a difficult choice for me.  I do not  agree with the right wing views of their owners but they have earned my respect for how well they treat their employees.. Use your GPS to find this place.  Once you find it you will not be disappointed.. I have a 18 x 12 door my opener broke! I called 3 other companies and no one would look at it because it was large and a comercial opener. Dave came out and had no problem repairing it .Excellent work. Honest. Fair prices. Friendly. I will use Dave for all my  garage door needs and will not hesitate to refer him to my friends.. This place tops the other Chick-fil-A restaurants I've been to. The service here is very polite and keeps any eye out if you need any drink refills. The presentation of the meal was superb and timely.. So good!

We go here whenever we're in the area, and hungry. So twice!

Both times have been great!

The first time we got this weird cantaloupe with prosciutto and chocolate mint with chia seeds, I can't find it on their menu because I think it was some special. If you see it on the menu get it. I wouldn't lie to you, internet person.

For the main dish(es) we had French toast (which was good) and a quiche (which was good), the second time we went we all had pizza (which was bad, just kidding, it was good.)

Also their house-made sodas are nifty, and they grow their own ingredients ON THEIR ROOF!. Good service and excellent food, even at an off-hour. Comfortable and lots of screens for watching a game or event.. Food: 4/5
Service: 3/5
Cleanliness: 4/5
Decor & Style: 3/5

The best part about this place is that you can eat Dim Sum anytime of the day! Overall good typical Dim Sum place with lots of space.. Had our finale dinner here last night it was outstanding! Reid our server was spot on with knowledge of dishes.We split a delightful  ceaser salad,I had fettuccine alfredo,and it was the best I ever had,handmade pasta AL dente perfection with a light refreshing  sauce...husband had lobster gnocchi it was very good but a little to soft.Cocktails were excellent. ..Manhattan up! Dessert was incredible, I had the Black Forest  cherry cake,outstanding. Husband had Cheesecake  with Cannoli and pistachio gelato...to die for .Service was impeccable, wonderful  ambience.A happy  way to finish our trip!. I started taking my vehicles to NAR after reading all of the great reviews here on Yelp. I have to agree with the 5 star rating. Randy, the owner, has been in the shop handling customer service every time I've been there and I have to agree that he is honest and works hard to get your car back on the road as quickly as possible. His prices are very reasonable.  His price for an oil change is great and he won't try to hit you up for an up-sell unless it's something that is really necessary to the well functioning of your vehicle. One word of advice, though, the waiting room is tiny, so don't plan on waiting too long for your work to be done if you are claustrophobic.. By far my favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh. From giant custom sandwiches to hulking burgers to salads bigger than you can imagine, this place has what your hunger needs. Not to mention the fantastic beer selection..... Ok, so I cocked up right at the start of my holiday!
I clicked collect my rental from LAX not Las Vegas!
However the area manager came to my rescue & fixed it all and saved the day
I can't say thanks enough & I've really enjoyed driving up & the strip in a Dodge Challenger!!
 THANK YOU FOX!!. 2nd time back very good food and service. Love the to start out with the egg rolls. Can't go wrong w /Orange chicken and chow mien.. Just so there is no confusion on here there was a post about Zzeeks pizza stating that the servers make a very low minimum hourly wage and depend on there tips to make there income. This is not true and is false the servers are very happy here and very well taken care of. This is a family owned business not an applebees. This is not a sit down and be served on restraunt u come in order and it's brought to u. The servers, cooks, dish washers all make the same amount hourly wage and were not referring to $4 hour i won't say what it is but i will say it's more than double that amount so next time u go to post something please make sure u have ur facts straight. Also all the tips do get divided between all the servers to make it fair because they all make the same amount so it's to make it fair. It wouldn't be fair to be working on a very slow night and help people that do not tip and make nothing instead it's devided between all servers so they earn more. I will leave it at this there are plenty of nights when it's only the managers and or owners working with no staff and they get tipped and instead of keeping them they go straight to the servers, even when the servers aren't working. The night manager is here until 3 sometimes 4am and they still make sure the servers get all the tips. Employees are happy here, the owners are great and everybody is WELL taken care of. So please make sure facts are straight before u make post on the worldwide internet when u have no clue what your talking about. Zzeeks u guys are amazing and it's so nice to have an actual pizza joint in the east valley where u can go drink have some great food and have fun. Thank you. Maybe it was the low expectations, and the ambiance isn't much, but the food was surprisingly good here. We had some kind of sushi rolls involving spicy tuna and shrimp (forget the names, probably "Embarrasing name roll" or "Screaming Vegas Regret Roll" or something) that was quite fresh and the beef bento box. The beef was surpisingly tender, the whole box was tops (sorry)! Even Hash House A go go can't beat this place when it comes to IP restaurants (we ate there once and the staff was totally apathetic, the service on life support).. Great concept, great customer service, great car! No hidden and jacked uo fees either! I love using silvercar for my car rental needs!. Good place to grab Sushi in the Shadyside area.. I saw the "Blues Traveler" concert here and had a great time.  I am no audiophille, but it was very good sounds, big screen monitors got us up close to the group, and I had an awesome view of the concert.  Granted I had great seats which was four rows from the floor.  

A quick note...the MGM Grand security personnel was kind of rude, but I think that was because they are union and they are on a time schedule and they herded us out like cattle as soon as the concert was over.  "Dang guys...slow down...the concert ended 5 minutes ago!"

I would definitely consider seeing another event here at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.. I've been here 3-4 times for breakfast now, and I wish it were around the corner from me.

Two words:  hash browns.  These are the best hash browns I've ever had.  Now I know what you're thinking:  who cares about hash browns, right?  WRONG.  These hash browns were perfect.  There ought to be a picture of them in wikipedia or something.  

I've had their egg sliders and huevos rancheros.  Highly recommend both.

Oh yeah, two and half more words:  free wi-fi.  In Vegas.  I challenge you to find another free wi-fi place on the strip.  Well, besides the ice cream place on the Wynn.  Another free wi-fi place on the strip outside of the Wynn.. I read the other reviews and was hesitant to go there, but after Jacksons put a dent in my new truck and wouldn't take responsibility for it, I took the leap. The place is a bit dingy and really needs a face lift, but otherwise I felt they were friendly, quick and did a really great job.. This whole day was a blur, but I walked there on a Sunday after we got about a foot of snow - I'm glad I made the trek! I knew I wanted breakfast and it was about 3pm, so a place that serves it all day is certainly the place for me! I went 'Merican Style for eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast. Bassett Street Brunch Club is a place that instead of giving you little jam packets for your toast, gives you a jar of fresh jam (not used to seeing that - but makes the spread that much better).

I sat up at the bar for my meal and found both bartenders to be friendly and attentive. From what I could tell, sitting in the booths looked cozy and comfortable. Looking around at what other patrons ordered has me excited to come back and try other options on the menu.

I also enjoyed the decor, very appealing to the eye and has a classic/retro feel. I could see catching a sports game there too, they have plenty of flat screens (technically not fitting in that retro theme, but hey, can't hurt to have a touch of modern).. Fine swine. The owners here are so welcoming.  As a dentist, I have never appreciated drinks that have a lot of sugar in them.  I'm a huge fan of unsweetened ice teas with boba.  A little bit of lychee or a bit of lychee syrup never hurt anyone though!  But anyway, on spring mountain, sometimes it's hard to communicate that I just want a weeeeee bit of lychee syrup in my drink, there is usually a language barrier.  The order usually comes out wrong.

I had the same expectations coming here.  But I was really surprised about the results.  While the owner was making my drink, she asked me to take a sip to see if it was too sweet or not sweet enough.  Such a nice gesture.  I felt like a kid though, because she was holding the straw as I was leaning in to sip it.  It still makes me laugh thinking about it.

So anyway, try this order... unsweetened black tea with boba and fresh lychee, and if that is not available, just a touch of lychee syrup for sweetness.  Perfection in a cup!!. My friends and I spent a darling afternoon here. At first it looks like a slightly upscale hole in the wall, but the decor is quite magnificent for its sub par location. If you're looking for a cheap place for crowds of people, this is definitely it. The more people you are, the less expensive the food. 15 dollar lobster? sign me up! The service is great and the staff is really polite and friendly. I would definitely recommend this place for groups of locals or travelers from far off lands.. We really enjoy this place. It's located upstairs in the El Pedregal complex, south of The Boulders. It is not your typical Mexican restaurant, but worth a try. Be prepared to pay for chips as they are not included. We selected the fajitas and the carne asada. Both were outstanding. Overall a fun place. PF Chang lite.  Jo Jo's is a good place for fusionish Chinese. The pan seared shimp dumpling appetizers are great.  The Asparagus Twin Twist is real good.  All entrees are under $15, so it's not too pricey.  There's outdoor eating too...if you like watching the Rea Rd traffice roll by.. Surprisingly good. Never had a piece of soy with so much flavor. I highly recommend.. We hired Carpet Monkeys to shampoo our carpets, and they did a great job this morning.  Rick, the owner, does every job himself.  Rick was willing to do work for us in a high rise, even though he had to deal with the HOA and drag his equipment up through the building.  The other carpet cleaners I talked to either wanted to charge more for doing high rise work, or would not take the job.

Rick showed up on time, was friendly and professional, did an excellent job, and charges extremely fair prices.  We suspect our landlord never cleaned our white carpets before, and they looked good as new when Rick was done!. As I'm usually the deciding factor in restaurants to dine at, I let my boyfriend pick a place that he wanted to check out.. How shocked was I that this new venue with a great libations menu would blow my socks off! Known for their seafood, with touches of different cultures such as Japanese, Korean, American, and many more this place is a must for a great bite that's also open late. My favorite dish is known as the amberjack crudo. I could eat two orders on my own. This is a wild Japanese yellowtail topped with an orange jalapeño ponzu salsa. This dish makes my mouth water just writing about it. Their spicy tuna tartare is served fresh to order and accompanied busy house made waffle fries. At first I was skeptical of a French fry as a tartare accompany but this hit the spot and gave a perfect mixture of salt, freshness and an impact of flavors. Make sure to check this place out you will not regret it!. It's a Saturday, and the lock to my house wont open.  I called Alcatraz who was open.  They arrived 30 minutes early, and quickly fix my problem, for what I consider a reasonable rate. I recommend this company for on-call situations, and I am very satisfied.. First off, anyone describing this as a dive bar has ipso facto never been in an actual dive bar.  Cmon folks, lets be a bit more discriminating in our choice of words.

The place looks like a dive from outside.  Squat, rectangular, in a giant shopping center parking lot, no windows.  Sign on the door that it is a private club.  It looks like a sketchy place to enter.

However once you get inside it is fine.  A smallish but generic bar, with a crappy internet juke box and a bar with no draft beers. However, neither in level of cleanliness nor in clientele is it a dive.  I have been there a number of times with my wife, and will be back again. Why?  The free billiard tables, of course!  That plus the cool little wood seats along the wall by the pool hall section.  We have never had trouble getting a table, and have found the clientele to be quite friendly and welcoming to newcomers to the city.. Not a huge steakhouse guy but for some reason or another I think I've been to every one in Vegas at some point.   What made Botero so special was not only a great piece of cow, but even moreso all of the supporting cast.  

The Crudo sampler was amazing, better than many seafood restaurants.  The Hamachi 'tartar' was basically spicy tuna crispy rice but with Hamachi, but really well done.  Dungeness agnolotti was really solid, althought the crab didn't shine through.  Sides were out of this world with pork belly + lentils, yams that tasted like candy, etc.  

My NY strip chimichurri style was perfect, a great cut if you like your steak with some spice.  Service was great as well.. Friendly atmosphere,great yogurt and reasonable pricing. What more could you wish for?. Why stay at the other hotels on the strip when you can stay here and experience excellence in every way??  I have been to Las Vegas over
20 times and this is by far the best hotel on the strip. The rooms are gorgeous with very modern everything ( so much so it takes a while to figure out the automated curtains, etc ). Room service twice a day, amazing bathroom, six delicious chocolates on each pillow every night. The restaurants were all good, the casino was great. The Cosmopolitan next door has a great bar that the younger people in our group enjoyed very much. We walked everywhere we needed to go from the Aria.. Got the double Ice Cream and man it was a lot of ice cream, so incredibly good.  Ironically no dark chocolate ice cream choice so I went with a double of Espresso Chip and Chocolate.  Dang, super good but too much ice cream for one person.  Should have gone with the single.

GREAT Addition to The LINQ entertainment district.. My favorite dive in vegas!  Only 1 block off the strip.  They have ridiculous prices, video poker, a killer jukebox, hot bartender, and a freakin LIQUOR store on premises. 

I bought rounds for 4 people, and spent less than 20 bucks.

2 dollars will get  you a Busch and a shot of cheap bourbon.

3 dollars will get you chilli cheese fries

4 dollars will get you a shot of Jack and a Busch

5 dollars will get you a patron shot ( if you like that garbage)

I LOVE YOU STAGE DOOR.

i dont need to leave Las Vegas broke anymore  =). Casa Fuente Cigars gets all five stars from me because it is truly a five star experience. The intimate location has a friendly and knowledgeable staff that will make you feel welcome as soon as you break the plane of the rich smokey paradise that awaits. Once inside you forget you're in the dry arid desert of Las Vegas.  The place feels and smells of a humid quaint bar youd find along side the road in the jungles of South America. You have the option to sit at a table or the bar where the available libations only add to an already exemplary experience. The robust humidor houses Arturo Fuente's finest.  There is a stick for every ocassion. From the house cigars, which are great and affordable smokes, to 90 dollar sticks for that special someone or event, there's something for everyone from the beginner to the total aficionado. You can grab a couple sticks to go or stick around to enjoy the aged, flavorful leafs. 

Whether you're an experienced cigar smoker or a beginner toying with the idea to embark upon a relaxing and enjoyable new hobby, I would recommend you stop by Casa Fuente located in the newest arm of the forum shops at Caesars Palace. Step in, grab a stick and light that bad boy up, and relax for a while while you enjoy the ombiance the great staff and patrons provide.. Very nice gentleman who directed me to another watch repair place to have some minor work done on a new Seiko I'd purchased. The only reason he didn't do the work is due to not stocking the parts.. We needed a break from wandering around all day and every piece of our body was killing us. We thought we'd seen a massage place somewhere in the Miracle Mile shops and finally settled on this place. They have the Aqua Massagers water massage tables. I've done them before and loved them so wanted to try it again. All the tables were full when we got there so they had us sit in these massage chairs to wait (for free). They had these awesome iSqueez calf and feet massagers that felt amazing. 

After that we got in the Aqua chambers and it felt great too. Definitely a relaxing end to our vacation. The water was relatively hot and that was the only piece that was uncomfortable. I'd have rather it be real cold, myself. 

The chick running the shop was a little pushy trying to sell us stuff at the end, but she took the No after about 4 or 5 times and gave us our total. I was so relaxed afterward that it was great!. I dont usually go to chain restaurants but my roomie was craving these veggie faux chicken wings (which i sampled and were pretty decent. I agreed to join her and must say was fairly impressed with the Lobster & Asparagus burger (natural meat, cooked perfectly medium rare). Even more so i was impressed by the attention paid to us by Emily the waitress. This nice young lady was on task! She made a great wine recommendation, subbed out the fries for steamed veggies, and what a great meal! Also picked at the fries my roomie ordered and wished i could have had a bit more restraint on them, cuz they were great, but not in my diet!. Met a couple of friends in Las Vegas for the weekend and they wanted to try this restaurant after listening to me rave about it last year . . . what can I say . . . another great experience.

This time however . . . we tried the sushi to start the meal . . . be had the blue fin tuna roll, sea urchin, and fresh water eel . . . all were unbelievable.  We also ordered the Crispy Brussel Sprout . . . and as last year . . . made this my favorite vegetable . . . again.

The main course for me was Niku Berry . . . the flavors . . . the presentation . . . man do I wish they had a restaurant like this near me.  For desert it was the Kamni-O . . . for a brief minute . . . I thought I was Elvis and died and went to heaven.

Another great dinner at Yonaka Modern Japanese . . . I will be back . . . again and again and again.. Nice, new, big grocery store on the corner of Durango and Warm Springs. Their seafood selection is impressive. A lot like Whole Foods but cheaper. Prices seem to be on par or cheaper with Vons and Smith's but they have a wider variety of quality produce. I've got one gripe about the deli. At Smith's they'll ask you how you want your meat cut and give you the first slice to taste. Here, I asked the lady to slice it thin. She sliced off the amount I requested and stuck it in the bag w/out showing me. Got back to my place and saw that it wasn't sliced thin at all. Disappointing but not that big of a deal I guess. I was also looking for creme fraiche but they didn't have any so I had to head down to Fresh & Easy to pick some up. Still, they seem to have stuff that other big box stores (like Vons or Albertson's) don't have.

I read in the local paper ("The Southwest View") that this place is a real mom-n-pop operation. It's run by Bill and Helen Glazier, a formerly-retired couple who owned a few other grocery stores in Philly. The article said they have plans to open a Glazier's in Henderson in the summer of 2010.. whooop whoooop whoooop whoooop whooooop!

Fat Tuesdays= fat smiles & weak liver!

The drink combos and flavors are sooo good- whooop whoooop!

Bring the empty cup back and get a discount on your next refill...kind of like a Starbucks! But they ain't serving coffee here!

whoooop whooooop. When buying a second hand bike, the one thing you want to be assured of is quality.  Such bikes can be rusty, slow and not especially good - the last thing you want to be doing is buying a bike with dodgy brakes and in risk of breaking.  Thankfully, there is a solution; Bike Station sells not only cheap, but also high quality bikes (they'll also recycle any unwanted bike you have but don't want) - in this respect they cannot be faulted.  After my last second hand bike fell apart after just a few months use I was about to give up on second hand bikes, but the quality here is first class and still very good value.  

Upon arriving at Bike Station, you'll see a sign in the street pointing you into a small car park.  Here, in what is really just a glorified garage you'll find Bike Station.  On Saturdays (Fridays for kids bikes) from 10:30 till 4:30 you can buy second hand bikes and on Wednesdays 4pm till 8pm and Saturdays 12pm to 4pm you can hire a work stand for £4 to fix your own bike.  Throughout all these three times you can also buy second hand parts.  

In short, this place is well worth a visit, whether you are a bike lover wanting to mend your bike or someone who just wants a second hand bike that won't break.  The service here is excellent and the quality cannot be faulted - if only all second hand bike sellers were this good I wouldn't have spent money on a bike that's now broken.. Some of the nicest coffee to match some of the nicest atmosphere I've experienced at a shop like this. The experience is only amplified by the friendly folk they employ.. I really enjoy this location, it's really huge.  Service is fast and consistent.  Like all other Paradise locations, there's a great variety of menu items.

The only real downside to this location is that parking is simply awful during the lunch rush in the middle of the week.. Jaleo is excellent. 

Service - our waiter, Patrick, was all class and a cool guy. He created a nice flow with our dishes and kept our waters full and cocktails coming. He knew the menu well and this is one of those restaurants where that's important, cuz you're going to be ordering around 3 dishes per person. 

Food - I really liked the tapas style and we ordered - bacalao, piquillo peppers, chicken and mushroom paella, a sharp smokey cheese plate, scallops, and the Iberica Bellota Jamon. The paella was the best I've had outside of Spain and my grandma's house. My buddy and I almost wanted more, addictive stuff. The Jamon was crazy good. Those 2 dishes really stood out, as some of the tastiest things I've eaten in a while. The rest of the meal was solid, tasty and well executed. We finished with french toast topped with vanilla ice cream and apples. It was a delicious, please order it. 

Drinks - this place has the best gin and tonics you'll ever have, they have 5 different ones and the Citrico was my favorite. Order them, trust me. Also the coffee was really really good, my buddy, whose not a coffee guy, loved it. It comes out in a french press with hour glass type timers to let you know when it's ready, and it tells you when it's reached light/medium/dark roast. 

Price - worth it. 

Environment - it's a pretty fancy place, but feels fun and not stuffy. It's well decorated, as is every little detail in the Cosmopolitan, that place is so sexy. Perfect for dates. 

Go here, it's delicious.. I go for the Thai iced coffee which is the best I've had. I will eventually try some other things especially when it warms up. They make each order individually. Some times there's a wait, but trust me it's worth the wait. Quality takes time. They ask me if I prefer more or less sweet, or more or less milky. Even when you order something and it's not to your liking, they will make sure you're happy with your drink. I saw a lady who had ordered the shave ice and the fresh guava that they use did not infuse all the way into the ice, so they added more for her. My wife tried the halo halo and was surprised that they make everything in house from scratch that they add to it, and she thought that it was great.. What a great hidden gem! 

Cupcakes are so delicious and their smaller desserts are so delicate and tasty that I couldn't just eat one! 

All the textures, and flavors really mesh well with each other. I found that their cheesecake bites are just DIVINE! This Definitely became my new spot! 

Just moving here from LA where they have a crazy amazing and innovative culinary scene, I've had some amazing desserts and some really bad ones. This is by far one of THE BEST places I've hit. 

And for the gentleman that mentioned that they probably had their friends review this place and that the prices should be cheaper; you sound bitter and cheap. Maybe you should have gotten your $1.50 cupcake from albertsons bud. 

This is a very good SOLID bakery. I can not wait to go back!. I loved this off strip dive Casino!. As the other reviews have said this food is amazing despite the shock of driving into the gentlemen's  club parking lot.. I ate here with my family last night. The food is excellent, service was great and the place is beautiful.  Recommend this to anyone who want to get there Pho on!!!. did i not write a review already? well, since we are now the proud owners of 4 baby chicks, tempe feed and tack will/has been our new go-to spot for all things fowl!

i have not had a negative experience. at least one person on staff accosts me and asks if i need any help with anything. usually i just describe "my chickens are 3 weeks old" and they immediately go to get what i need. they stock giant blocks of bedding and feed all at a very reasonable price. 

along with countless other items, you can't go wrong with these folks. and for dog food buyers, you are all set with tempe feed and tack. 

i hope to establish a long relationship with these folks.. I went here on Sunday (8/3), and I've forgotten the waitress's name, but she was a young blonde girl. Anyway, I had a fantastic time at this restaurant.

Waitress - I think she was the best waitress I've ever had, so I really wish I remembered her name! Incredibly polite, really funny and charming, returned to check on us multiple times, brought out new waters without having to be asked, etc.

Anyway, on to the food. The bread and olive oil she brought out at the beginning was good. Nothing spectacular, but certainly good. I ordered a caprese appetizer, and while it was smaller than I was anticipating, it was delicious, delicious, delicious. They used some of the best basil I've ever tasted. For my salad I chose the "creamy parmasan" dressing, which was really disappointing. It had an almost fishy aftertaste, which I wasn't expecting, so next time I would choose something different. And then for dinner I ordered the "tag pic pac." It was also really good. The portions were really generous for that, and I had some leftovers to take home.

Five stars for service, four stars for food. I'm rounding down to 4 stars, rather than up to 5 stars, however, because our table was kind of dirty when we were seated.. This place is really great, has many kind of pastries and a lot of collections. I would recommend this place to all those who has good taste for pastries and coffee/ tea. I really like this place.. Traveling alone the temptation is always there to simply grab something fast and head back to the hotel.  I confess I was using yelp to find a quick solution when I came across Aroma.  I recently had a great experience at a top rated Indian restaurant in London, so I  decided to give this restaurant a try.  Am I glad I did!!

The menu is large and the waitress/owner gave me some help.  EVERYTHING I had was outstanding.  The service was also great.  I was pleased to see that on a Wednesday night they were busy. I cannot recommend this place enough.  I will definitely go back.. I have had my cars serviced by Henry and his crew for about 10 years or more.  Only things that need fixing are fixed and at reasonable prices.  Service is prompt and punctual.  Henry has a lot experience in the automotive area.  I recommend his services whenever I can.. Where's the button for 6 stars?

I relocated to Las Vegas at the beginning of the year and needed a new dentist.  I saw two others before I found Dr. Catalano, and I'm grateful I did.  I wasn't impressed with the other's practices, skills, or "chair"-side manners.  With Dr. Catalano's office I got all three: a professional, well run practice, professional (yet delicate) skills, and chairside manners to boot.  Everyone, from the assistant Onnie, and the hygienist Cassie, and Tabatha helming the wheel at the front office, to Dr. Catalano herself, everyone there has just the right mixture of perfect job skills and perfect people skills.  You feel a sense of having made the right choice soon after visiting.  I love 'em.. Great place nice food and wonderful tequila selection, ask for Erin at the bar for the best service.. It's usually a hit or miss with this particular terribles and I'm only speaking on the car wash portion! Out of all the locations I like this one the best because I know the car wash manager she is so great! Im telling you great customer service will have you drive past other location to basically go out of your way just to get them! I always experience very good service and my car washes have been the best out of the other locations!. If something's not right and you're not satisfied they will take care of it and make it right!. I've been here about 6 or 7 times in the last year. I went again last night, and as always had a good experience.

The food is very good. The burgers are delicious. The nightly specials might not be the cheapest, but you get a generous portion for your money.  Last night, I had a Ranch Chicken Sandwich, and it was great. It came with a heap of fries, and I had leftovers.

The service is also great. A very friendly bunch. There is always this older lady working at the bar, and she is an absolute hoot! She's friendly, funny and and reason enough to go back. The cooks also come and ask you how your food was. Really great service.

And yeah, it might suck that they don't have 30 beer taps like every other bar in Madison, but bottled beer is good enough for me.. I have used Green Valley Shoe Repair & Luggage 2 for a few repair jobs I needed on shoes and a wallet.  They always provide quality work at very reasonable prices.  Would not hesitate to use these guys again as they always do a great job.. Food id very good but sometime a long wait
to get in.. Got a pretty tasty iced latte. Location is nice and central, with a very chill atmosphere.. To start, this is not a high class, white linen restaurant. Maciano's is a local, small, friendly restaurant that serves excellent Italian cuisine in a quiet, serene little quaint atmosphere. We have stopped here many different times, usually on our way home, to grab a bite. There's usually one waitress on duty, who also serves as the hostess. Our last drop-in was on our way back from a two-week romp around the country. Driving home after a long flight is always a dreaded experience, but seeing that your favorite little Italian place is open mitigates the angst a bit. Stopped in, had a few beers, a great meal, and then went home and slept like a hibernating bear.
The only reason we don't give a five star is that their delivery pizza could use some work. Its just a bit too greasy, a bit flat and undercooked bread wise, and the prices could be a bit more competitive. 

That being said, if you do go, please enjoy the bread bits they make and serve as an appetizer, for free, with every meal. They are hot, little pieces of parmesan heaven. Couple that with a couple Peroni's, and your meal is delightfully ruined. However, it definitely tastes great heated up the next day. ;). Perfectly executed old-school french bistro. Classy and sophisticated but not stuffy. Clearly popular as the place was quite crowded by the time we left. Reservations probably required.  We arrived early with younger kids and they were perfectly polite and friendly. Would probably be harder with children later in the evening, but that's true anywhere.

Raw oysters and celery rouemalade for starters. Oysters were salty and fresh. Roumalade was light and almost creamy (though no cream in it.) Duck confit salad, duck "steak" with figues, a hanger steak frites, and country vegetable soup for main courses. All done to a tee and couldn't be improved. The steak frites was truly standout for an old standby. And the duck with figs rich and flavorful for a winter night.  Soup was a thinner broth based one, in a classic french style. Not super hearty but flavorful. Desserts were a dense dark chocolate torte and an exquisite ile flotant with the whipped egg whites covered in a dome of crystalized caramel. Both exceptional!

A demi of red Languedoc wine complemented it all quite well and was reasonably priced. Well worth a visit for french bistro food done as it should be.. I can see why people are just packing it in here. A great place for visitors and locals.

Wonderful atmosphere. Quality wines and great gnoshing dishes. There is a friendly, knowledgeable staff to advise folks about there options. Top notch bruschetta with a great combination of fresh ingredients. Brie and apple, dates with pistachios being my favorites.

Make reservations because the beautiful crowd is huge. 

Best deal ever, happy hour - $5 wine by glass is the best deal before 5pm. foods are really great, environment are neat and organize. server are very friendly and approachable. the nilaga is the best for me! i will come back here for sure!. Some friends of ours brought us to this place a few days ago.  The food was amazing.  We ordered the Phoenix platter for four people, which gave a salad, appetizer, soup, and about four or five different meals....all of which, awesome.  The food was delicious and fast.  The prawn rolls were my favorite.  Looking forward to going back and trying other things.  My friends who brought us here told us that they have tried nearly everything on the menu and haven't had anything bad there....it's all been great.. My first time visiting this place and it was a great experience. We didn't have reservations, but the host was getting ready to seat 4 people to a table and that they would be freeing up 4 people from the bar, so BAM, we got seated at the bar in about 2 minutes. Branden was the bartender/waiter and was an absolute crack up. The food was fresh, drinks were great, and there is no reason not to go back.. My favorite place to buy groceries!  Love the selection and most of the prices!. Came back around Sunday at lunchtime for a friend's birthday.  Things have improved since my last visit, though the tap list still needs a little work.  They have a brunch menu on the weekends where you can get $10 and $12 dishes that include one 10 ounce draft.  I decided to get one of their $12 dishes, the Mother Bunch Benedict with biscuits, turkey, bacon, green chili hollandaise, arugula, tomatoes, and a couple of poached eggs.  Came with a side of home fries.  Really satisfying dish.  The biscuits might've been slightly on the dry side, but everything else worked beautifully.  For my beer I got the Mother Bunch Cara Cara Wit (basically their in house Belgian).  Very refreshing and light, which was what I was looking for.  Unfortunately they ran out of two other in house brews from their tap list so yet again they didn't keep their tap list up to date.  I'll say it again, they need to do a better job of updating their chalk board and they should update their tap list daily on their website & menus rather than advertise an everyday tap list that doesn't necessarily reflect whats available.  So dock a star for that.  But again, they've really upped their game on the food menu and the beer I was able to get was top notch.  So close to microbrewery perfection.  Keep on improving Mother Bunch!. As Noel M stated, I would give them more stars if possible.

I've been to places that are friendly, the few times I have been here, they were always friendly and happy.  Always clean, and a pleasant atmosphere, and for me it's local.  

Kinda reminds me (my age) like Andy Griffith and Mayberry, small town, always a smile, and always welcome.

This business will go far, I think it's family owned, and it's the kind of business you want in your neighborhood.. LOVE this place. The  grounds are expansive and lots to do.  If you want information about anything Vegas, ask for Thaddeus at the Concierge Desk. He's the man.. YUM.

best green curry I've ever had!

Thai iced tea free with check in!  

Service was great!

Authentic, tasty, and quick!  Girlfriend loved it too.  I will definitely be back when I'm in vegas again.. This may be the best room in Vegas.  The food is pretty good too.  I had the John Dory with roasted veg. and veal jus.  It was very good. Service is awesome as is everything else about this place.  Bring a bankroll though.  They're not afraid to charge a price.. I've been to a few of the valley Zipps and this one is probably my favorite. Went there last night with a handful of friends. The service was great. Our server was really attentive and had a good sense of humor. And when she was too busy to drop off our drinks, another server was coming by with them. Top notch.

And I had the pleasure of destroying a basket of chicken skewers! Dang those are so good! They're different than most chicken strips/fingers in that they're not overly battered. For a strip of fried chicken, they're surprisingly light.

Decor is pretty nice, brick walls all around. Partition between bar area and sit-down area. And it's nice that there's a good mix of people. This location is a bit of a drive from my house but I will definitely stop in again when in the area.. Fret of all I'm not a big fan of tours but we were in Vegas and had a free day to visit Hoover dam. Decided to do tour instead of rent car when found a deal on travelzoo. Picked us up at 845 for a 1030 tour which made it a little bit longer than expected. We were bussed to a hub locale where we were ticketed and drove on to dam. Driver very knowledgeable and engaging. Hoover tour was great and plenty of time to do tour and get back to bus. Next stop was a buffet lunch at railroad crossing casino. Buffet was so so, but good salad bar and filling. Next stop was chocolate factory which was not running much today at this time on a Sunday. Got back to hotel before 6 and got a lot info for rest of stay in Vegas. Would recommend and would do another tour with these folks.. Awesome most amazing desert shop I have seen in a while.  Went for some birthday gifts for my wife and came away with a bag full.  I really love the cake pops and the cupcakes were off the chart!  Very nice staff and they took very good care of me!  Recommended to any chocolate sweat treat lovers!!. The food here is really great... if you like authentic Thai food!!!  Suggestions include... Mint Chicken (Chopped Chicken Chili Mint), Shrimp Pad Thai, Tom Kha Ghai Soup, Beef Satay.. Tapas are amazing with a lot of variety to choose from. The scallops, oxtail, and risotto is amazing. Good service and amazing food.. Excellent sandwiches...wish they have a place in LA. If you are looking for a quick bite...stop by PH for a sandwich.. I love Aloha Specialties.  Not necessarily for the quality of food, though it is good.  I love Specialties for what it implies:  when I'm eating at Specialties, it means that I'm in Vegas!  I always get the Portuguese sausage, scrambled eggs, and rice with a side order of chicken teri.  Maybe a spam musubi to go.. Came here based on other reviews. 

Staff was very attentive and service was great. The space was quite clean and nicely appointed. 

We had the Chicken Shawarma wrap (#1) and the Beef Shawarma plate  (#4).  All food was fresh with good flavor.  The pickled beets were a nice side that came with the main dishes.  

A filling, good flavored meal at a reasonable price.   I happily recommend.. First I should disclose that cycling is my great addiction! When traveling without my own bike, I always fit a ride or two into my itinerary using rental bikes. 
I rented a bike from Outback Adventures while in Scottsdale, Arizona last week. When considering the rates, quality of equipment, ease of rental, general policies, and customer relations...I've got to rate this shop the best I have ever encountered! 
I return to Scottsdale every year for Spring Training. I'm so glad that I discovered this place...planning on many future rentals.. Rebel pizza is a must kick it up a notch with bacon! The Victor and hamslaw sandwich are a must have. The bread is on point nice and warm with just the right amount of crunch! Both pack a mouth full of flavor multiple layers of flavors. You won't see all the original menu items from the original shop on on Desert inn & Arville. But a great way to shake up the menu. This location is family friendly kids are able to come in this location. Great chicken wings and fingers. For a new twist try the Italian wings or fingers. They also serve local beer a great way to support local companies. OMG, does any more need to be said about this place???

Vegan, they have two kinds of Vegan Cheese.  Vegetarian, they can accommodate that as well.  Gluten-Free pizza crust, WOW.  Vegan DESERT, YES.

The food is awesome, the people are awesome and if you have not tried this place, you are missing out!!!

Check online, they have nightly specials, you can order online and pick it up, or you can go in and they will treat you like royalty.

We love this place and will go back often.. I'm in walking distance from this location and it is always well stocked with available, clean cars....unless there is a MAJOR event in town.  I remember when it was north of Fry's on Cave Creek.  Love it

Charles G. A nice selection of stores right next to the Farmer's Market, includes a nice Levi's store and a Lego outlet, just to name a few. Good place to go to enjoy some air conditioning and escape the crowds after visiting the market across the road.. I have been here many times and it has impressed me (almost) every time!! They are unique, the staff is extremely friendly, and the food is pretty good! 
Their breakfast dishes fit better together than the lunch menu, but I've enjoyed both.
I went many time without ANY troubles however...

The most previous visit threw me off quite a bit. They seemed to have changed the style a bit. You used to walk in and order from the counter (which has a large menu above it) and grab your soda and pick a seat. The last time we visited, they sat us down restaurant style and had a server take care of this. You can tell these poor employees were NOT trained to be servers. They were scared, skipping steps, making mistakes and causing the visit to take a very long time. Half of one of our orders was dropped on the table and we got a "sorry" with no return or offer to get us another waffle. They have a wonderful fountain machine with countless options, but I was only offered standard pepsi products by my server. I was still served plastic utensils with my food in a cardboard container yet they expect you to tip now? Im sorry but this transition to a "service" restaurant was not smooth. It was all very confusing and left a terrible taste in my mouth. I don't want to be harsh on my rating since I've had so many wonderful experiences, but I will be dropping it to 1 star if this becomes regular.. I live at Veterans village they saved my life from being a homeless veteran they are a bunch of very caring, loving people they care about the Veterans who live at veterans village if it wasn't for veterans village I would have been a homeless vet. May God bless all the staff and veterans who live there at 1150 S. Las vegas blvd. Went here last night with a party of 5 at about 7pm.  I've never seen the place so uncrowded before.  It was great.  Didn't have to wait 30 mins for a table.  Parking still sucked though.

I got my usual.  The green chili burger without the bun but instead of fries I got the Caesar.  The salad was just eh and I should have ordered the corn instead.  Next time.  Anyway, the burger was very good.  I still have no idea why it just doesn't come with ketchup on the side and you have to ask for it instead.

The service pretty much sucked.  Our waiter wasn't very attentive and 2 out of the 5 orders were screwed up.  The manager came by to say sorry and said the 2 meals were comped.  That was nice.  The waiter also gave us a piece of the red velvet cake which was also very nice because the red velvet cake is excellent and some of the best around.

** Update 5/16/10 **

I received a "compliment" about my review above.  It said, "F*ck you douche bag".  Not sure who it was but I politely said I don't swing that way and thanks for the offer.  The guy probably works there and just has a Yelp account to send random emails.  Anyway,  I am flattered.. Afghan place owned by an afghan person very nice
and warm person with descent quality Persian 
/ afghan food which is almost the same they have
Good food with descent price as well if you are in 
Vegas and you do not want to go to fancy dinner or lunch
this is a place to go. Great donuts, friendly staff especially Tony! Wife and I pickup donuts at least three times a week.. Came for lunch, not a bad price at around $5 for the wrap I had- southwestern chicken wrap. Jay say Au bar- smells a little dirty and the bar looks cluttered. Terrible location for the bar in the restaurant by the way- but they bought the building as is. 
The wrap was very good. Opted for chips and salsa side. Salsa was good and tasted fresh (I wonder if they made it? ). Never understood why multi-color tortilla chips are used ever- these were red, white and blue. 
I'll probably come back in an evening to try the fried oysters out.. Other than perhaps the Cine Capri, this theater doesn't really offer anything that you can't find at any other Harkins.  Having said that; If you're going to head out to the movies, there's no reason to pass over this theater.  it's a big, clean multiplex, which attracts a big crowd, but manages to never really feel too packed.  The auditoriums have stadium seating, plus good picture quality and a nice sound system.

Enjoy your show!. Coffee is very good. Duck Confit is aiite. Sausage and eggs were good. Bloody Mary too.. What a great place. This facility is the total package. From trainers to dietitians, whether you're training for a fight or just trying to get ripped, this is the place. This facility also has a great lifting area. 
In association with Syndicate, Dominate Your Game works hard to facilitate your training and make sure you're on track to achieve your goals. Their saying says it all, "Because someone has to lose."
It's also nice to see the occasional UFC fighter sparing in the cage.. Second year in a row here: New Years Day detox.  To our dismay when we arrived New Year Day they said that the new policy was that non-guests cannot come in on the holiday days (although they did before).  I had called the day before to the concierge who said that we could come in.  So they were nice enough to let us in due to the conflict of information.  Unfortunately they also ramped up the price to $75 from $45, but what can you do, they are very pricey.  
The spa itself is unparalleled for anything I have been to: multiple rooms that are nicely maintained and decorated, multiple types of rooms and temperatures.  The Arctic room was a favorite since that room cooled you off to normal temp (it snows in there!) in between steams in the Hyacinth, mildly steamy, and dry saunas.  There is an elevated pool mid-temp and then a big Roman Bath room with hot, cold, and medium tubs.  Very decadent and when you leave you feel such an amazing sense of calm and relaxation that is not found elsewhere.  If you have money to burn you can add the other spa services but it is simply too much for my soul.
Four stars due to the restrictive policies, extreme cost, and the creepy funeral director type character that keeps prowling and staring in every room (presumably to stave off any illicit activity). I haven't been to a dentist in a while, the entire staff experience for my first was great.  My experience with Dr. Tom was exceptional. I would recommend this dentist without any hesitation.. This place is still my "go to" place for Asia specialty food. It has slipped quite a bit from its former glory - it is still a decent place to go.

I especially like the vegetable section where they have "$1.00 bag vegetable" special - not a typo, it is a "one dollar bag vegetable". It appears whenever a new shipment comes in,  they wrap the older item in a see thru plastic bag trying to make a quick sale. For the most part, it is still very fresh. I am over weight, I eat plenty of vegetables, This is a blessing for me.

This place no longer stocks a full array of Asian items, fortunately for me, it still have all the items I needed at a reasonable price.

There is two little restaurant inside the market. The Vietnamese restaurant is OK, not great but OK. decent food, decent price.
There is a small sandwich shop. Not sure if its Vietnamese? Korean? or whatever. I was disappointed.  (food, price, service .. yea...all that). Very good food! Fast delivery!. Phoenix Sky Harbor has gotten so much better in the past few years.  All of the great restaurants inside are awesome!  All local places that will give you a great taste of what the valley has to offer.  The tram system is making things much better to get from the economy parking lot.  It still lacks some improvements to terminal 4, but it's on the right track.  The flow of the airport is very seamless and you can't get lost.  Nice job to those in charge of making this airport a great stopping destination for travelers.. Really really good bloody Mary's along really good food and service.  Border Bowl with a fresh tortilla. The best!. Traveled 4.5 hours to see a baseball game and luckly we found Rockerij. I would travel back 4.5 hours just for the food. The service was amazing as well.. Love this place! Nice rooms, great views. This was the first time we have stayed here and will stay again for sure. Not overpriced for what you get. We were very surprised at the quality for the price. Staff is great. 

Casino is nice and honestly pretty quiet compared to the rest. The bars in the casino are nice and pretty much around the same price as other places. Most have great happy hour prices on food and drinks. 

Restaurants are all pretty good but, The Pub is amazing and is great for watching sports! Also has great food and a great happy hour setup! Diablo's Cantina is on the corner of the resort and we go there every time we go to Vegas so, obviously it's great as well.  

They have a nice walkway that has some good shops and a tram that takes you from MC to Aria to Bellagio. 

Only complaint I have is the WiFi is pretty much only the first two floors (that's what the sign says) Which won't  bother most people since they're not in the room much anyways. But, for the cyber junkies it wouldn't be very good I guess. I was fine with it coming and going from our room. We were on the 22nd floor so we didn't expect super great WiFi anyways. 

Keep up the great work and I'm sure we will see you again soon!!. All I remember was that the service was exceptional and the food was amazeballs.

Located on the 3rd floor of Mandarin Oriental, you can either self park at Aria or do the valet for Mandarin Oriental. 

Decided to hit up the the brunch for a birthday with friendsies. We got there on time (of course there had to be a reservation to be made). Sat down and was greeted promptly by our server. I asked for water and the watermelon juice. Yum!

As part of their brunch, you get one entree. I decided to order the Makhani. BUT entree didn't come until later. Buffet food first!!!

They have almost everything Asian you could think off. Sushi, noodles, BBQ pork, crab claws, oysters, you name it. They even have different types of meat and cheese for you non seafood eaters. LOL. They also have a salad and fruit bar (I didn't check it out cause I wasn't there to be healthy). The dessert bar was in the other room. 

Overall, 5/5 for everything.. Just unbelievable flavors, iced today's chipotle carmel doughnut, the classic bacon  maple, and a repeat favorite cronut.  People at this shop make it personal making it even greater and comfortable.. Best theater seating ever. I love movies and I love comfort. Ever since they remodeled the seating. This theater can't be beat. All they are missing are key food choices like hot dogs. My kids beg to go here.. A must visit anytime your anywhere near Scottsdale! The wait can be long, but, find a place at the bar and enjoy the wait!!

You can't miss If you try the roasted chicken and rib combo. Also gotta get an artichoke....its fire roasted!!U. This place has been here since 1960. A really good restaurant,with really good food. On this trip we got Pizza and wings to go. You call in and they have it  ready in 15 to 29 min. The pizza crust is really great. I always love their Pizza. It is one of the best  in the valley. We got 2 types of wings hot and BBQ. Both were fabulous! There is not a lot of parking in the lot because, it is so popular. So you may have to park on the side street but, all worth it.. I like shopping at thrift stores for one main reason, treasure hunting. You never know what you might end up finding. I did end up purchasing quite a few cheap items for my Halloween costume here. I found an inexpensive cowboy hat, vest, plastic guns with holsters and a sheriff's badge. I even found a few things for my next year's costumes so I won't be doing anymore last minute shopping.. I stayed here and my overall experience was a good one.  I had the king suite which was very spacious and met my expectations.  The price was stellar and the restaurants, gift shops, were good as well.  

The fitness center could use some upgrading as it is very small and cannot accommodate multiple people exercising one muscle group.  

The top of the tower view is great and there's a restaurant that slowly rotates so you can view the whole city.  I didn't go on any of the rides ( no death wish yet) but they look really cool.  Maybe next time I will do the bungee jump.

Only thing i didn't like about the Stratosphere is the housekeeping workers didn't return my souvenirs which was key chains and magnets.  Not even worth $20 but hey, @#$% rolls down hill right?. The gelato at Caf Gelato is the best on the strip. Even better than the one at the Miracle Mile shops (I forget the name). I helped myself to a scoop of watermelon and coconut. These are two great combinations. You can taste the watermelon chunks and even the coconut flakes. The service is excellent, the prices are very reasonable, and the seating area is clean and relaxing. After a long day of gambling and walking, I like to end my night at Caf Gelato and eat my worries away.

Highly Recommended. Awesome food. My girl friend and I had the baked special and the fried special great food, love the Asian influence on the fried Strips creamy wasabi well enough said, staff was great, friendly, and fast. All food was fresh and cooked right there. Overall great place to go.. I do not often go out to Coffee, but at times you just need to. In the Summer I only drink it in the morning.  Even then it makes me too hot.
So I thought I would give a nice iced coffee a try since it was mid day. I like these things sweet. so I love that Starbucks had raw Sugar. 
I like heavy cream and Raw Sugar, so that is what I like and they have it!
Friendly staff, nice clean place.. Nice French wine and food that is actually fresh and prepared to order. If you are coming for dinner make a reservation.. Al is awesome. Friendly, great convo, educated me on some cooking techniques. And then there is the meat. Phenomenal meats. 
I like to smoke a nice pork shoulder. He's got some extremely tasty pig in there!. Tried Redbeards today for the first time. The place was pretty busy but I was able find a seat at the bar. The bartender seemed friendly and energetic when he greater me. I was happy to learn that they serve raspberry ice tea and decided on the Ballpark Burger with a side salad after reviewing the menu. 

While waiting for my burger I took in the atmosphere. Six TVs lined the walls behind the bar; all on mute playing sports stations or TNT. The walls adorn Pittsburgh sports art. Contrasting that was the dim, almost too dim, lighting. It's hard to tell whether they're going for a sports bar or contemporary romantic feel. Of course I notice how well stocked the bar was and what a nice selection of craft beers that they have on tap. 

Oddly enough, my burger came out before the salad. No real issue for me but I think it does reflect a small hiccup in the kitchen. This was easily forgiven though by the quality of burger that was served. It was dense and juicy without making the bun all soggy. The bacon on it was thick and chewy, not that cheap, thin stuff that some places try pass off to cut cost with. The burger was topped with provolone cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato and pickle. Well worth the $11.00 they charge for it. 

The salad that I had afterwards was mostly lettuce with two slices of cucumber, two slices of onion, two cherry tomatoes and two pepperoncini's. In the corner of the dish there was some sliced up black olives... I had to wonder that if you were to put the slices of olives back together, would they combine to make of two whole olives? The southwest dressing that I got with it had a nice zest to it and everything on the salad was super fresh.

Despite some of its idiosyncrasies, Redbeards gets a big thumbs up from me. I felt I got a good value for the meal that I enjoyed and I wouldn't hesitate to suggesting it as a meeting place for the next ball game or show that I go to in the Cultural District.. What's to say about a place that always has a line of people outside waiting to get in? Not really much except that the food has got to be good! I got the chorizo burrito and it was out of this world, I had heard this place was good but when you actually go there the first time and all your high expectations are met, well that makes this place outstanding! Aside from the food this place has a very local atmosphere which I love and let me tell you that the service rocked and all the great looking female servers are another great plus! Go there on a Saturday or Sunday morning and expect to wait to be seated but it's highly worth it!. WTFriggz!!! Actually, this place is obnoxious if you go alone for your first time... like Vegas. 

Cool shit on the walls, old school Pac-Man or is it Centipede?? Now you get to stand in line like you're getting ready to ride Goliath at Magic Mountain. Today I gave my order to the head-cook. No! You don't pay yet, go over there and stand in line again... Ok, now you pay before you wait yet again for your lunch to be called out, first name basis. Your deliciousness comes served on a pizza tray. Why? Im sure Valley Pizza is looking for these.

Awww-shit! They have Barq's Cream Soda!!!

Ya know when you sat down to watch Alien vs. Predator and said to yourself "Man! This is going to be awesome!'  Then the feeling you get when the credits roll. Hamburger Works is nothing like that.. WOW!! This place is great.  I took out my girlfriend here on a date recommended by another friend.  We are glad we listened.  The best tip I could give that was given to me, if you and your date are not big eaters save the money and order one plate.  Its that big.  They are a little pricey so it doesn't make sense to order separate plates just to have more than half of each thrown away :( The food was delicious, we really liked the food and the atmosphere.. I recently moved in across the street from Joe's, and have been walking over every Saturday morning. I get the border omelet and potatoes everytime, so I can't speak for anything else on the menu, but it's good for what it is. Joe usually stops by the tables and talks to everyone which I really like. The guy knows how to run a business. Coffee is good too.. They say you don't know what you've got till it's gone...how true about the Pyramid Cafe... For as many years as I can remember, I've made it a point to eat at least one meal at the Pyramid Cafe at the Luxor.  The fact that it WAS open 24 hours a day, plus they had some delicious food (the Monte Cristo was excellent, and loved their Halibut Fish & Chips).  

However, I just got back from a business trip in Vegas and stayed at the Luxor.  Signs on the Pyramid Cafe anounced that they were only open for breakfast, closed at 11am.  I'm honestly shocked and disapponted by the new hours, one less 24 hour dining option that had way better food than Denny's or any fast food joints.  I'm just hoping this was a temporary/seasonal thing, being that I was in Vegas during the "off season".  I really missed the Pyramid Cafe this time, would've loved to eat there again, but couldn't make it there during their new, limited hours.  Please go back to 24/7!!!  I want my Monte Cristo and Halibut Fish and Chips!. Acclaimed celebrity chef Nobu Matsuhisa has a restaurant in every continent. 
 There are two high end sushi joints here in Vegas. This location not as swanky as the one in Caesars Palace  nevertheless is a signature restaurant for the Hard Rock Hotel and a little more casual than 35 Steaks next door.
The elegant dining room with Bamboo thrown in the ceiling and minimal décor in a Zen sort of way it's warm and inviting. 
To start the yellowtail sashimi was superb, delicate sensuous .The crispy tempura rock shrimp drenched in a yuzu spicy sauce over salad greens was tangibly addicting. The picture of the Black Cod in miso should be posted as the Wikipedia definition of umami simple, savory and sweet accented by a pickled ginger shoot. The sushi was ordinary but respectable fresh. A nice little green tea ice cream for dessert to complete the Nobu experience. The staff were friendly professional rock stars.
If you want to feel like a baller the groupon deal is the way to go and you be treated to a nice multi-course adventure by one of Japan's best chef. 
Kampai.. This is a great place to take out town guest. The food and atmosphere is great. Prices are above average but matches the quality of food. Best BBQ in Phoenix. We were here because of Diners Drive Ins and Dives Tv show. My wife and I pulled up to the parking lot and it seemed kind of edgy but we went in and so glad we did. It wasn't very crowded so we sat right down. We were greated by a nice waitress and she gave her recomendations. We went with the Guinea pie which is a white pizza with home made meatballs and ricotta cheese and a garlic sauce. We also tried the suicide fries which had a habenero sauce with three kinds of peppers. Oh my gosh was it hot but addicting. The carnitas tacos were good too. We live in California but i can see us making a spontaneous road trip to eat at this place sometime in the near future.. Here's my personal experiences....

Always book online directly from the Car Rental company....you can always cancel or modify your reservations afterwards.  You might not be able to do that through a third-party website (ie. hotwire, priceline, etc.).

Shopped around online and finally decided to book a sub-compact from Dollar Rent a Car.  Used my Amex because it had additional auto insurance coverage so I didn't need to purchase any insurance from Dollar.   Joined their Dollar Express membership online by providing my drivers license and added a credit card to my profile.  This allows me to avoid the line-ups and go directly to the garage to pick up the car.

Once I got off the plane and picked up my luggage, I hopped onto the Car Rental shuttle bus (signs are outside the terminal).  I waited 2 minutes before the bus arrived and it took an additional 10 minutes to get to the McCarran Rental Car Center.

Tipped the bus driver, headed inside the Center and went straight downstairs to the Dollar garage to present my Dollar Express card (which I got in the mail before the trip) along with a photo ID.  It took 2 minutes to print out the contract and get it signed.   You then go to the sub-compact section to select and inspect the vehicle you want yourself.  Keys are in the ignition...you just start it up and drive to the exit to present your signed contract along with a photo ID.

Attached my garmin GPS that I brought from home and I am done with the whole rental matter.   The whole thing took about 30 minutes after getting off the plane.  If I was not an Express customer, it would have taken another 45 minutes or more.  

Parking is free everywhere on the strip.  I only paid parking when I went to Fremont street.  It always bugged me that I had to pay 22-25 bucks round trip taxi for an "In-N-Out Burger" craving.  Also I would always wait 15-25 minutes to get a taxi back to the strip when I went to chinatown for a meal.  I had a pho craving at 2am one night and a rented car resolved all these issues.

Returning the Car:  Make sure you fill-up the night before returning the car. The Rental center is open 24/7....just follow the "return car" signs and find your rental company.  Park it and give your contract to the attendant.  He is able to print out your invoice with a portable handheld machine.   This took 1 minute.  Hopped on a shuttle bus outside and headed to the airport (make sure you know which terminal) which took another 11-12 minutes.   It was effortless...but you need to make sure you show up at least a hour or two before the flight.

This was the first time I rented a car and I plan to do this everytime.   I paid $275-$300 in taxi fees on my previous trip.  This car rental cost me $9 per day with unlimited milage (plus taxes) and I used up $13.50 in fuel.  It was definitely worth it and I would recommend it to all (unless you plan to drink a lot).

Hope this info helps.. For a neighborhood restaurant / bar, it is hard to beat Mac's. They serve really good food at a fair price. The people are nice and the atmosphere is comfortable.

I often visit for lunch, the burgers are hard to resist.

Some of their happy hour specials are hard to beat. Try the chicken quesadilla, I think it's a few bucks during HH and it is really good. 

Weekend breakfasts, tasty dinners, fun beer tastings and a good place to watch a game are a few more reasons to visit Mac's.

A true gem in Tempe.... Wow was I impressed with this clinic.
Didnt expect this type of facility for such a great price.
Then meet staff and Doctor and was blown away.
Now a member and will definately tell my friends 
Thanks for getting me back on track.
Literally. My husband gave this a 4 but I would give this a 3-1/2*. pros: more organized layout of food stations unlike Bellagio which was difficult to manoeuvre, great ambience unlike Bellagio's cheap interior, better quality food. My kids love the gelato, my husband loves the pizza which was very good, prime rib was good. I think overall quality and variety were good but nothing stands out for me. I liked the curry cauliflower, curry beans, salads were good but the meat dishes were not that good to me. Fish dishes were either overcooked, too salty or too sweet.. Saw this place on Triple D so I decided to give her try. My expectations were high and when I arrived I was shocked that on a Thursday morning the line was extra extra long. Had to wait patiently which when it comes to food I don't like. 

But needless to say the wait was worth it because when I got in there I was served quickly. I ordered the pork chop, eggs, and hash browns.  The pork chop there is fabulous and the toast and home made grape jelly was good. 

I would recommend this place for breakfast to anyone who is in the downtown area of Phoenix. Make sure to try the bacon too.. There is just not enough stars to give this place. This family owned business has the nicest and most down to earth staff I've met. They are friendly, courteous, and know how to treat a customer right. 

I went in to have them remove a flash hider on my barrel that the previous owner had lock tightened down hard. No amount of heat, pb blaster, and prying could have gotten that thing off without damaging the barrel. Since I did not have any "gun smithing" tools I decided to take it to them since I was in town. Well they gave it a shot and had to completely disassemble the upper receiver to get it together off. They even offered to install the new flash hider for me. When it came time to pay they said it was on the house!! Now I couldn't just let them spend 20 minutes of their time and labor and not tip them!!! 

I will definitely be a repeat customer after this experience. The shop itself is quite small and and the inventory is more for shotguns and rifles. Not too many tacticool products there. They do have a small inventory of handguns as well and their prices are more than competitive in comparison to other gun stores. 5 stars for excellent service!!!!. I'll admit the excitement was real when I came to Dilallo Burgers and I have to say after eating their burgers and onions rings, I was quite satisfied. Price tag was less than $9 and I ordered their trio which consisted of a standard burger, onion rings and soda. The burger was good but it's smaller than expected... the patty was seasoned well and the burger came together. Yummy. The onions rings were really good!

Overall, a decent place to have lunch.. Was looking for something refreshing for a nightcap on a hot Scottsdale night. You will not be disappointed. The sorbet was really tasty and refreshing.. Have you ever wanted the most amazingly perfect eyebrows?  All I can say is you MUST go visit Jackie at the Beauty Bar Salon!  She is amazing as a wax specialist AND as a hair stylist!  I have been going to her for about a year now for both my waxing and hair needs and she has been consistent with keeping me beautiful!  They are having a special for waxing and hair services right now -- call the salon NOW to book your appointment!  You will not be disappointed.. I've been to this pool hall many times. Its not just one of the best pool halls around its one of the best places around the SE valley to hang out. The staff is friendly, they always have specials going and the food from the pizza place next door is good too. Its also a great place to go in and watch a game on their HD tv's between a game of pool or darts. I can't wait to get back to AZ after my summer trip and stop in again to visit my friends and grab a cold one.. I always receive great customer service at this location, (unlike pretty much all of Southern California)

Associates in all the mens departments are helpful, picked up some great cole haan sneakers after returning some items in the rail department with a breeze. Store is bright and clean. Sales people don't attack. I usually am not a fan of thin pizza, but Settebello is amazing.  This traditional pizzeria is always a treat for my family.. This IS a gastropub!!!  

150 bottle selections including a huge number of difficult to find, limited edition and seasonal brews, 20+ international and microbrews on tap, multiple cask matured ales tapped on site all backed by one of the most interesting and diverse international wine list, 300+ selections strong and a more than decent malt list.   Now were talking!

And the food.  This isn't your usual fish and chips, sliders, and nachos.  This is pub fare at it's finest.  The bone marrow served with a bacon marmalade and coarse sea salt is so rich, unctuous, and just plain good eats once spread on some grilled bread.  The four inch long bones does a great job preventing the marrow from overcooking. Perfect.

Other must try plates include the grilled octopus, potted duck rillettes, veal sweetbreads with a refreshing green apple slaw, and the blow your mind great poutine (thin fries topped with duck confit and a cheese curd sauce).  Finally, the lump crab salad that is more crab than greens accompanied by a tempura avocado and supreme of grape fruit.  Well balanced and delicious.

Note:  the dishes are made to be paired with beer or wine.  They taste salty if eaten alone.

Prices are in line with other true gastropubs.  Beers average $10. Wines below typical Vegas resorts.  

Service is excellent.  Bartenders and servers are extremely knowledgeable.  Amazing considering how quickly the selection of brews change.

Highly recommended for a good time!. So what can I say about COB as I call it? Well, heavenly goodness and joy comes to mind. I am a bit of a fuddyduddy when I go there becuase I love to get the #13 sampler dish. It has a little taste of everything I love at COB's. I love their tortillas, honestly for those I would give up soda for a year just for a batch of those warm desirables. I love the atmosphere and the service has never disappointed me. Every birthday my friend asks me where she can take me and I told her she already knows the answer, COB's. Thanks for being a staple here in Phoenix, you bring joy to so many.. I used to eat at Lee's in SoCal. So it was a pleasant surprise to find on in Chandler when I visited.  This one is modeled just like the other ones. It's big and spacious.  Lots of Banh Mi choices.  I had the Special and it was delicious just as I remembered from SoCal.  They also have pre-made desserts too. Love Lee's!. Almost mad I've spent 3 years in the QC without trying this place. Excellent home cooked southern, cheap and smack dab in uptown  (across from mascara hof).. Great food, friendly staff, live music! Best part for me is they were an unlisted vegetarian vegan option! Tons of delicious options.. I've used this photographer for several family sessions. She has always been very professional, good to work with...and takes great pictures!. Ahhhhhmmmmaaazziing! I had the mexi-burger and it was probably the single best burger I have ever had. Perfectly juicy and crisp. The fries were also very good. and oh my the soda selection. I did the math and there is about 500 different sodas. A must go in my opinion.. My favorite spot for Filipino food. Love love love it. Tonight we are also trying the shrimp, and crawfish too. This is so much better than the other places we tried like boiling crab and about tied with hot and juicy. Shrimp Wednesday 6.99 lb, crawfish Monday 6.99 lb. Yayeeeeee. We are big fans of Aaron May, so anticipation was high as we made our reservation for a Friday night at Iruna. We had mourned the loss of Sol y Sombra, so we were excited to see the similarities and differences of one of our all time favorite Valley restaurants. 

Right off the bat, the service hit the mark. Seated promptly, our server was busy, but made a point of stopping by and telling us she'd be right with us. Not long after, drinks were ordered and delivered (big plus!), and we were being walked through the menu. 

I think, in the end, we split about 6 different plates. The Gambas ah Ajillo (shrimp) and the Scallops were our favorites. They were simply amazing. The lamb disappointed a bit, unfortunately (Erik has VERY high mutton expectations!), but the pork loin, chicken meatballs and the spinach with chick peas were all fantastic. 

While 6 plates seems like a lot, the portions are small and we left with the rare feeling of having tasted so many wonderful & different flavors, yet not feeling like complete hogs! 

We enjoyed the meal so much that were back just a few days later. With a friend in town for business, we needed a place in Old Town that was unique, fun and where our friend had never been. We received tons of compliments from him on the food and ambiance. Somehow we managed to maintain our reputation of being in tune with all that's hip and delicious in the Valley. Thanks, Iruna, for making us look so cool!. What I Ate:

Awesome Southern food for downtown.  The food was incredibly tasty and the interior is a old style diner.  The servers were helpful in picking the right foods.. I went back a second time and they have changed the way they make the Wellington.  It now only comes one way you cannot order it medium well or any other way.  Just thought it was funny after my initial review.  Still very good though!. My girlfriend and I decided to try this steakhouse the week it opened.  Although I've eaten at two other of Tom's restaurants, I was blown away by the quality of the food.  My steak was so juicy and cooked to perfection that I went into the kitchen to thank the chef personally for a wonderful meal.  If you are in the area, this place is a must go.  I highly recommend it!. Went here for dinner with two other people while on a business trip.  The food was actually pretty good.  It is located in a great area also, near a lot of interesting little shops.

I'm not sure what the classification of food would be... it's eclectic.  I had the following:
Blue Crab Appetizer - Crab and avocado basically.  The crab was tasty.
Scallops - Pretty Good scallops, not really a fan of the risotto.
Mushroom Pan Fry - Good.  I am a huge mushroom fan.  I really liked the mushrooms but the sauce was a little too much and possibly drained the tase of the mushrooms a little bit.

Their desserts are strange too.  I don't remember what it was called but it had the word lavender in it.  The ice cream was "Earl Grey" flavored and actually pretty good, but the pie/cake thing was meh.

Atmosphere is pretty much pitch black.  Prices are on the higher side but not too bad.  Parking will be impossible at dinner time.  You will have to valet it nearby for $5 plus tip.. My friends kept telling me this was the best buffet in Vegas so I had to try it since we only had time to go to one buffet. Honestly, it didn't live up to expectations but I contribute it to the fact that we came at 8PM on a Wednesday (there was no wait). What was good was good, but what was bad was because it wasn't fresh. There was so much food that I almost missed the back section around the corner. I had to make some tough decisions about which food to get. Since I like everything you can imagine my dilemma. The best stuff I had was the warm crab legs and oysters. Deserts were pretty good too. They had creme brûlée which was definitely a must try. Upon entering this buffet I thought I was entering an art exhibit, not a buffet. It's so beautiful. All in all, a good experience. If I were to come back again I would probably come for lunch cause dinner's over $50 which I can't really justify but I'm glad that we chose this buffet as the only one we got to go on this trip.. I thought I was having dinner in Europe! Beautiful! Delicious! We will return multiple and bring friends.. Jacob Palmer might not approve of the GAP, but I am a huge fan. This is one of the nicest GAP stores in Las Vegas. The selection of clothes is varied. The only issue is their sales area is heavily picked and tends to be slim. 

With summer winding down, most of the stores are in the midst of clearing out their inventory. The best part, we stay warm until the end of October. I like the ombre t-shirts and the colored skinny khakis.. New favorite!  The spicy tuna and jalapeño roll. Spicy and amazing!  

The Katana roll was also delicious. It had shrimp tempura with tuna and yellowtail on top.. I have to start out by saying WOW! I completely underestimated this place! I've been procrastinating coming to eat here for like ever! Only because just the thought of a salad bar sounds beyond boring! However after being talked into coming with one of my co workers for lunch I left extremely satisfied! They have an incredible good selection of salads and toppings to put on! And don't forget about the wide variety of soups to pair with those salads! I also found that the little breadsticks and or pizza things they had were good as well! Lastly the tiny little ice cream cones are adorable! Ha! I will most definitely return... I think this place was pretty good.  I'm an east coaster.  I usually cook my own shellfish when I get a craving for it but this time I felt like getting some in public.  The patio is smoking which for us smokers is a rare treat.  They had poker going on that night.  They basically took up the entire patio but they seemed like wonderful people (I love to play free Texas Hold Em but the wife was with me) they were polite and having fun.

The service was EXCELLENT.  Two bartenders on that night.  They seemed incredibly busy with the poker people but they always came and checked on us.  Never once did we feel ignored.  To be honest, it was the best service I've had in quite some time.  Extra bonus points seeing they running around for the poker people.

The food was outstanding.  I had crab cakes and they were AMAZING.  My wife had the talipa and it was tasty.  

Overall, this is my kind of place and I would come here again.  If time allows it, I'd love to come back to play poker.. This is my first time eating Venezuelan  food, and let me tell you I love it!! The arepas are super good and so are there juice drinks!. My fav spot for sushi. I'm a regular and tried just about everything. Very good food, and drinks are decent as well. Recommend the spicy tuna and philly roll.. Alright, enough political crap that I had to get off my chest.  Let's talk Vegas.

Only been to the Pick Taco once, but it was really good.  The Hard Rock has a fun presence and I'm looking forward to checking out their new poker room/lounge on my next visit.  The Pink Taco is worth the trip alone though.. First time I've ever stayed off the strip and it was a great experience! Honestly, I stayed at this hotel simply because I wanted to go to the top of the tower without having to pay $25 per ticket, and so I was on my way to Vegas, needed a place to stay right away, and killed 2 birds with one stone. 
Yes it's located far from the strip, but not too far that you can't walk, drive, or take a taxi! Come on people stop being lazy! The best thing was their wonderful customer service at the front desk, housekeepers, and at the casino. Since this was my first stay here, I wasn't aware if they had a renovation or anything, but the room was big, clean, fresh, had contemporary amenities, and the prices were very reasonable. And best of all the tower had AMAZING sights! A must 'do' if you're going to Vegas!
Unfortunately it is located in a very seedy, ghetto area of Las Vegas, but hey! you won't notice it if you don't care. I go to Vegas to have fun and that's what I had. Will I stay here again, definitely. I'm a fan!
Is it fun and safe for kids?, honestly I don't know because IMO Vegas is not for children, you people who bring your 5 year olds to run around in smoky casinos need to see a psychiatrist.
I also did not pay for any resort fees, but then again I booked it on Orbitz.com, so maybe they omitted that.

Oh, and Vidya K (a couple of comments below mine), drunk people in Vegas? SHOCKING!!!. I read through the other reviews and I have to say... I'm a little shocked. My experience was great! Both bartenders working were absolutely fantastic! The renovations are great and this place is much more updated and fun. The beer selection is great too which is always a plus in my book. Much better selection than the sister companies of PT's and Sierra Gold. Lots of TV's for sports fans and excellent food as well. Try the Jalapeño Sliders... They are superb. And they have excellent Tots! Need I say more?. Just for the record absolutely hands-down the best middle Eastern cuisine I've ever had still to date ! Me and a buddy AJ and his family went here couple years ago now ...damn good food omg it's really amazing.. Yes there is other places in town but after revisiting this place again it's just better I think. You have to check out the Kibbeh, Falafel, Chicken Shawarma, Kafta Kabobs....!!  They also have a few desserts but my favorite is Baklava. If your a coffee person try the real deal Turkish coffee .....You won't regret it you'll thank me later ...enjoy!!!!. This literally the best pizza I've ever had.  I did not know pizza could have such complex flavors. It was our Anniversary and our server was Cole and he was awesome.  Keep in mind it is real wood oven pizza so they can only cook 3 at a time so the foid does take a while to come iut but more then worth it.. I enjoy coming to this and other Z-Tejas locations for their great food, good margaritas and the awesome fun bar on the weekends. The reason for this review is the great customer service I received during a recent visit to the Mill Ave location. Our party encountered a small issue with the outside chairs having some moisture on them thus resulting in a small stain on one of the clothing items. The manager, Joel was very professional about this mishap, explained what had caused it and went above and beyond to take care of the awkward situation in a very professional manner. Mistakes happen but what matters is how this restaurant's staff handled the situation.. This is the my favorite Costco. It's less than 8 miles from my house and the staff are so nice. Most important, the fruits are fresh.

Not all store are dealing with customer the same way. I find that customers shop at this location are more polite than other location. The parking lot are a lot of bigger than other location.. My soon to be wife and I had our first date here, I won her over with pizza and had her take a slice of cheesecake home for her Mom, that's how you do it boys. 
While this location isn't quite as "jazzy" as the Old Town spot, it is still awesome and has, in my opinion, perfect pizza. Yep, I've eaten at pizza places all around NYC and the country in general, and Grimaldi's is my favorite. Coal-fired, thin crust perfection. Throw in a good mix of old jazz music and a good wine list and you have a recipe for awesomeness. My fave is the pesto pizza with ricotta and sausage... heaven. They have good salads too, but who cares? 
The Chandler Grimaldi's is fantastic, four stars for sure, but if you have the option, hit up the five star Old Town location in Scottsdale, but you can't lose either way.. This was part of our buffet pass. And honestly I would come to this buffet solely for breakfast. I would go to either planet Hollywood or rio for dinner if I had the world of buffets pass. Simply because the selection here is really small. The meat cutter for dinner is a great guy very comical. But I would stick to breakfast here because the creeps are amazing.. We were looked after by Paige who was fantastic. Oh the cocktails were great too! The gold leaf in the first drink of the night was a nice touch. The view of the strip coupled, live music with stunning drinks made for a fantastic evening, and we can't wait to go back tonight.. Hmm Mexican or Chinese food...ok both! Yep I did it again, found Chino Bandido where they combine both! Super good and sorry I didn't come up with that idea earlier. A must stop in Phoenix, AZ! Pollo Diablo and Jade Red Chicken with Fried Rice and Refried Beans would be a good start! www.ontheroadeats.com. Robuchon....what else is there really left to say.  Perfection.

The restaurant is as good as it is in any other city.  I make this compasion to the Robuchon in Macau!  

The bread cart makes you want to keep asking for more the caviar dish is sublime, the tasting menu does get a bit over the top.  I like to describe the menu like waves of cuisine crashing into your soul relelntlessly battering you into submission to remember each and every wave of divine french cuisine.  

I only regret going there on the first day of a 5 day trip but making the reservation for 8 pm (EST was 11pm), by the time we finished the meal it was around 11pm.   It was a little late for us and had to order some espresso to finish the entire tasting.  

Once again pricey but for the experience you should try this once, hell maybe even twice.  I would also suggest L'atelier because it is also a show but again worth every penny!  

Cheer and happy eats!

P.S.  if you have a reservation and are not staying at the MGM...THEY( Robuchon) will send a limo for you there and back....DEFINITELY a nice touch for Vegas this is  must!. Coming from San Francisco - I'm used to lots of good vegan food, so didn't expect much from Vegan. Finding some simple vegan options around Vegas is pretty easy - finding GOOD vegan options (much less an all-vegan place) was harder.

I just had breakfast, but it was one of the best tofu scrambles I've ever had. Great unique flavors, and the staff clearly take passion for their food, feedback from customers, and innovating new things.

I'll totally be back - a gem in the desert!. Steve showed up on time. Steve said it wouldn't be a problem for my dents. for reasonable price one other Dent shop said I would have to take to the body shop wasn't necessarily true. Thank you Steve job well done!!. My daughter's become obsessed, infatuated, really, with this Greenway. Her grandpa (my dad) gave her a bike for her birthday recently, so all she wants to do is take her bike to the Greenway. And she wants her dad to run alongside with her. So this past Saturday, in spite of the looming thunderstorm that threatened to ruin our day, me and my wife and our daughter went for a stroll/bike ride.

I promised my wife I wouldn't go for a run while we were there. I love running, but, lately, this seriously bad case of plantar faciitis has cruelly cramped my running style. I can't run long distances without feeling as if some vile scoundrel is taking a ballpeen hammer to my heels. Ye-ouch! Also, my wife doesn't like to run, because of her knees, and the last thing she wants is to see her husband run off and get his 4.5 miles while having to mind a willful and unruly 5-year-old while trying to get her own workout in. So, bad feet and all, I cede to her wishes and opt to power walk along side her, while our daughter pedals ahead of us. I don't care for power walking. Me, I want something with a bit more impact. But, promises are promises.

That promise lasted 1/4 of a mile. My daughter decides, no, INSISTS, that I run along side her. She's peddling fast, so she wants someone to be next to her so she doesn't get herself too far ahead, and have to turn her little head around and see where Mommy and Daddy are. I turn to my wife, and she gives me this, "Oh, FINE, GO ON, ABANDON ME!" look, and off I run.

Much to my delight, my feet are holding up well, thanks to a brand-new pair of New Balance 730 running shoes that are just the right fit for me. So much so that I've bought 2 pairs of these, one in a blue and yellow combination, the other in a red and grey combo. Put these shoes side by side, and I made this observation: one pair of shoes is Ohio State, the other Michigan. And I couldn't care any less about that blood rivalry, but the color schemes made me think of that. Why? Well, it's kind of obvious, no?

ANYWAY...so my feet are holding up well, and my daughter and I make the run/bike ride from the McMullen Creek entrance, off Johnston Road, to the edge of the Piper Glen shops off Rea Road, and back. All together, a good 4 mile trek. And Mom kept up with us quite nicely, so let's give her a hearty round of applause! Along the way, I pointed to a couple of turtles lounging on the path, much to my daughter's surprise. 

That same night, though...ugh, the proverbial water-boarding of my feet was taking place. I could barely walk. No joke. Utter agony. Of course, my wife shakes her head and tells me, quite perturbed, that someday I'll listen to her and give up running. Will I? Sure. When my feet are chopped off.

I can't wait for this coming Tuesday, when I go see my primary care physician for my annual physical, and convince him to give me a Cortisone shot. Yeah, I know, Cortisone...once you start, you can't stop. It's like crack. Yeah, well, my feet need some fixin'. 

Actually, this wasn't a review. It's a greenway, folks. Lush and green and well-kept, perfect for runners and bicyclists and pedestrians. I love this place, and so will you, even if you just want to go for a leisurely stroll, or if you want to walk your dog. 

Thank you, Charlotte and Mecklenburg County. Because the future belongs to greenways.. I'm sure, no one wants to have to have any kind of surgery, but IF you must, this is a great choice.
From the ease  of doing almost all your check in paperwork at home on the computer... To the amazing nurses in surgery prep, to the actual procedure and post op recovery...
My visit was as good as I could ask for.

Just do to nerves, I can't recall the staff members names very well, but I have to give the nurses there a BIG thank you!! They all were amazing, friendly, helpful and had great bedside manner.
It made my out-patient procedure much easier to deal with.
Thank you!!. We came back today. We were apprehensive but things went very well.  Everything was great: food, service, etc. a real effort was made to make up for a prior bad experience. We would have continued to have meals there but this was a very good experience!!. Took a tour of Vegas last night for a couple hours. Really nice driver. Fun to ride in a cab. I would use this company again.. Our favorite Mexican food place here in Phoenix. It's a New Mexico style place so if you are looking for traditional style this isn't your place. We always get the Pollo con Queso. The spiced cream cheese is amazing.  Hot and fresh chips with salsa.  The mild salsa is a bit too sweet for me but I love their hot. Service is usually excellent.. Catfish po boy - 5 stars.
Shrimp po boy - 4.5 stars.
Gator po boy - 1 star. 

As a big alligator fan I was horribly disappointed with the gator PoBoy.   The gator meat was soggy and possibly undercooked.  The catfish and shrimp were excellent and I'll be ordering the catfish PoBoy from now on.

Wait staff was very friendly!. This is embarrassing.

I decided to go on a Burger Binge to find the best burger at 3 places that are within blocks of each other on East Tropicana.
The Badger Cafe.
The Dispensary.
Sammy's LA Pastrami.

I know, I know....a little excessive. But someone had to do it, and it was very revealing.

The Badger Cafe has the best burger of the three, without question.
It's grilled not fried and the meat is fresh and flavorful. 
And it's cheap: $3.99 for a half-pound burger, or another dollar if you get it to take-out.

The Dispensary's burger is a close second....same price for a half-pounder, but $2 extra for take-out. This was the only burger of the three that came with fries, but unfortunately they were boring and limp.

The big disappointment was Sammy's. 
I like the place, and I especially like the guy who runs it. But this burger was really uninteresting and the only one I didn't finish. And it's twice the price of the other two.
The problem is the meat. It tastes like those pre-packaged patties you get at Costco...kinda thin and not flavorful at all. It's obvious these are not freshly-made patties and that makes the burger very ordinary.
However, Sammy's does have the best fries of the three of them: the Garlic Romano Fries are phenomenal, but cost extra.. If you're a fan of Oscar Goodman you'll love this place.  Traditional Las Vegas gourmet room with fantastic service, beautiful ambiance and wonderful vibe.  However, the food was not the best but nevertheless good quality and preparation.  The steak and prime rib are the way to go.  I did not care for the sides except the Caesar's salad.  This place has live entertainment and a great bar with a nice bar menu and wine list.  Overlooking the Fremont Street Experience you'll have a delightful time here.. Ever feel like donning a fedora and walking into an establishment where you could truly feel like Don Draper from Mad Men?  That is the Tornado Club Steak House.

My wife and I went there for the first time a few weeks ago on our anniversary.  While we waited for our table to be ready, we sat at the bar, which had the look and feel of a place that hadn't been touched since 1963.  Unlike a gross, greasy-spoon diner, this is not a bad thing.  It felt very classy and made for a great atmosphere.  

Now, my go to cocktail is a simple Jameson on the rocks.  At a place like this I was prepared to pay $8-9.  Not so.  Instead, a more reasonable $5 price.  Impressive!  They also have a wide variety of martinis that I wasn't brave enough to try this night, but hope to soon.

As for the food?  Let's put it this way:  My wife, a filet mignon connoisseur, found the Tornado Club Steak House's far tastier than the uppest-scale member's only dinner clubs in Chicago we've been invited to.  It was very well seasoned and cooked to my wife's exact specification.  I had the salmon, which I'll admit was probably the best salmon I've ever had.  Again, perfect seasonings and cooked perfectly.  I have never been to a place that had a side for dinner of shredded hash browns.  Not only was this a smart choice for a side, but they give you practically a pound of potatoes, all well-seasoned.  Plenty of leftovers that re-heated perfectly with the next day's breakfast.

Word of caution:  Make your reservations early.  Calling even a day or two in advance will get you a Saturday night reservation of either 5:30 or 8:30.  Being the parents of small children, 8:30 would near our bedtimes.   Also, the deliciousness isn't cheap.  Prepare for a hefty bill.  Not "oh my god I have to mortgage my house" expensive, but it's going to cost more than your average dinner at Chili's.  But fear not, you definitely get what you pay for.

I definitely look forward to donning my fedora next time I come in, even if but for a drink.. The store is easily accessed and always clean. The employees are friendly, no idea about helpful as I have never asked a question here. 

My first visit here some time ago was very disappointing. Nothing seemed fresh.

I did not give up though and have been back several times now and each time it is always a bit better than before. My only complaint of the vegetables these days is they seem to not have one of the products I need. Today was leeks, how can you not have leeks? Wal_mart neighborhood store on my way home had them. 

But I do love the bulk spices where I can spend 10 cents at a time and get what I need for the day. Also the bulk grains and beans are great. 

So overall this is a pretty nice store.. Wow. Eat here.

Steaks and frites are awesome.

We got to sit outside, on the strip, across from Bellagio. Very nice.. My wife and I have loved this place ever since we moved to Crafton over 5 years ago. It is the picture of a greasy spoon diner. Counter and table service. Big portions and decent prices. The waitresses have always been friendly and the owner/cook is nice as well. This place gets packed on the weekends, so be prepared to wait a little while at the door, but it's worth it! The Omelettes and Big Breakfast Burrito seem to be favorites of all the customers as well as myself. The home fried potatoes are a must side for any breakfast.. First off, this place has a nice organic vibe.  Second the staff was friendly a bit on the helpless side though, still new so no bad marks for that.  Third, great visibility to the coal oven (looks like a brick pizza oven on steroids)

Menu: all grass fed beef (definite +), Vege burger (brown rice and black bean) is a must next time.  Drinks: nice change from the norm, Boylan's Sparkling Beverages (sticking with the natural theme), nice touch, also they serve Gelato shakes (seems like half the customers ordered them).

Devour: kept it simple and ordered the Classic Coal Burger with side of mushrooms and a drink.

Price: $10

Next time: Yes, there will be a next time.  The burger was above average and I can taste the coal flame (yum).   Vege burger and sweet potato fries you mine next time.. Beautiful venue - plenty of free parking only a short walk away.

Not large inside, good vantage point from upper levels.. I was in town on business.  Friend (local) took me here and we had a great time. 

- Wowzers on the great tap beer selection---ESPECIALLY the happy hour prices (half off!)
- Great service
- Cool interior
- Started to get packed around 7pm
- Food is pretty good--certainly above average, but I would venture to say there's way better pulled
- Tabasco friend pickles are a WINNER!
- Be sure to take advantage of the free hush puppies and try ALL of the sauces they have to offer 
- Again, back to the beer - so great!!

Cool joint.  Glad we went.. Have everything you need for a party! It's the go to store.
Tasha and angel were great they helped me save 10%. Stayed here for the first time this past weekend. Went to Vegas on whim and PH offered the best price for what i was looking for. Centrally located on the strip which made it very easy to go around all the hot spots. Miracle Mile is very cool and Earl of Sandwich is open 24hrs. Room was not bad, but housekeeping could use a little help. Overall satisfied with our stay and will definitely come back.. WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!  I dined here for brunch for the first time and it was a true standout experience and one of the best memories I'll keep with me after this weekend. 

FOOD: I am not a huge fan of French Cuisine but this was good.  Great quality food and easy for anyone to eat if they aren't familiar with French food.  

SERVICE:  FANTASTIC. Our server was very respectful and the server assistant was very attentive and respectful to give us our space when we wanted it.  I think she read my lips one time when I said I needed more coffee because before I could turn my head to get someone's attention she came with the coffee and said  "I'm here!" I was so impressed!  From the host stand, to the servers, and back to the host stand, I had the best customer service in Vegas at The Eiffel Tower Restaurant.

AMBIANCE: It was the perfect balance of comfort and class.  I loved the windows and the decor. 

VIEW: INCREDIBLE. I was able to get a panoramic view of the Bellagio water show but also an unobstructed view of the strip.  With the decor and the views that it offers, it is a new MUST-DO destination on EVERY Vegas trip in the future.  

I will be coming to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant every time I visit now and am now open to staying at the hotel.  I haven't had dinner there but I definitely will next time!  I'm a raving fan!. If this is the place I think it is, then this is the place where I went to pre-school. 

I still remember Haddassah (she scared me with her gruff Israeli demeanor, but you knew she was the real deal), Lisa, Wendy, Alan (the director of the summer camp),  Cindy, and probably some other teachers if I thought about it longer.

OK, I admit it, Haddassah. I stole those dominoes that you asked me about. But they were awesome, they had pictures of Superman and Batman on them! 

So I went home with those dominoes and hid them under my shelf because I felt so much SHAME and GUILT. I never looked at those dominoes again. Now that's some good JEWISH education.. Great burgers.  The burger menu is a little odd so you may have to build your own.  Get that tator tots, they were bad ass!. Some of the best BBQ in the valley. Whole hog heaven was awesome and our server sawyer anticipated our needs perfectly.. What an awesome hotel with a great staff and quite laid back atmosphere. The ambiance of this hotel is second to nun. They have a free shuttle service to the Wynn and Caesars Palace witch is great and runs every 15mins. Also, right next to fashion show mall! This hotel doesn't have a casino so you don't have to deal with the loud night life of Vegas and can relax in a 5 star hotel and enjoy life but your steps from or a free shuttle ride away from one. The rooms are very clean, spacious and I would recommend the one bedroom suite. Full kitchen two full bathrooms king bed and pull out sofa. Make sure to book trump if coming to Vegas!. Returned for a quick lunch and got the classic gyro sandwich with fries.  Nice portion size.  Fries were not over cooked - done just right.  Extra yogurt sauce in a little plastic cup in the to-go box was a nice and welcome touch.

Have a selection of unusual drinks and I had a Jaritto (?) mango soda from Mexico.  Tasty - although my colleagues kept teasy me about drinking a beer!  You could tell it was Friday!

Also, I tried a few of the little plastic wrapped candies they have in bins near the front of the store.  The nougat with pistachio nuts in it was very good.  The one which is orange with a date center looked better but I was disappointed in the flavor intensity.  Still tasty though.. Best experience we had in purchasing a car. Our salesman, Robert Dyer and his manager, Martin Perez are exceptional people. They took care us and made the entire process a good experience. I would recommend this place to everyone I know.  One of the very few times where we didn't experience the "typical" car buying experience.. I visit Las Vegas three times or more per year, and ever time we have to stop and eat at Maggiano's. It reminds me of some of the old Italian Restaurants back East. It's Italian comfort food and the service is excellent. Last year my wife and I celebrated our 30th Wedding Anniversary and we booked our dinner at Maggiano's. The waiter was not only attentive, but engaging. He interacted so well with everybody from my 90year old mother to my 4 year old grandchildren. The food was great.. Holy yikes and wow!! New NODA facility up and running! Great location, same awesome beer! Much bigger tap room with a bright airy feel. Exposed brick, church pews, a big ass fan, giant covered outdoor space, two bars, same awesome beer, same awesome beer - did I mention same awesome beer? A real breath of fresh air for these guys! Great to see them expanding. This review is over because I have to go fill up my growler!. Ok I have to say this place is pretty good at first glance. I am not sure if this is a local chain or just local.  

It has a cool jungle feel that matches it's name. The menu is two sided half American half world flare. 

I was seated in the bar which can be hit or miss but I have to say the bartender was friendly and stayed on top of her tables. 

I ordered a White whiskey old fashioned that was strong and tasty. Not the best I have ever had but good none the less. 

Ordered pot roast with a side of extra veggies. I skipped lunch so I needed something extra ha. 

I would come here and recommend it. Nice people, fair prices and good drinks and food. I literally pass by this place every single day.  Always, was curious and a friend, said it was good. So what the hell. First and foremost, the menu is extensive. Every type of hot dog, made every way possible, with every topping you could ever imagine. Not only that, but they had burgers as well and sandwiches. They had you're mushroom burger, patty melts, and some creative burgers with ingredients I have never seen mixed together. Very original. I had the Pastrami Melt. Good old pastrami, grilled onions, mustard and swill on grilled rye. It was dead on, geat sandwich, very filling. For 5.99$ I was very satisfied. I had some of the italian fries. Those were good, I wish they put a little bit more of the garlic butter, and a little less parmesan cheese. That might just be me though, whenever butter is part of the equation, you better use a lot of it, or not at all. Go big or go home. I had a bite of the patty melt, my friend had. very delicious. This is small operation that obviously knows what they are doing and have a great thing going. I am a fan, and will go here more, the menu is so big, it entices you to come back and try the other stuff.. Only reason I'm giving it four is bc they forgot to bring me my order. people there were very nice.. If price/cost wasn't an object,  I would eat here all the time. My steak was fantastic, atmosphere was great, service was nice and attentive, and everything about this restaurant met expectations. However, I would be lucky if I go here again in the next two years. My wife and I had a $100 gift card and we still had to pay $30 more to cover our bill. The only thing I didn't like was how you have to order sides separately. Otherwise, we had a wonderful time.. Casey Moore's is an institution as ASU. Having attended ASU and frequenting the establishment during my four years it is the bar I hold all other bars against. 

I'm not going to bother writing an in-depth review because there are enough great review and very few bad reviews. I will say this Casey Moore's, unlike many of the bar around ASU, draws a diverse crowd. My art and design friends and my fraternity friends all came here regularly. It draws a bit older crowd as well, lots of alumni in the area still drop by. 

As a restaurant I would give Casey's 4 or 5 stars too. Hell, whenever my mom would come to visit me she wanted to eat lunch as Casey Moore's. If you are averse to being around a bunch of college students then perhaps this is not the place you should be drinking at but it is still worth a visit for lunch or dinner before the night crowd comes.. This is my first review, so as you can imagine, I really liked this place.  First off, it is cheap.  $11\Adult and $6\Kids (Over 4)

Second, some of it was top notch.  I am a huge Spareribs fan, and if you catch them bringing a fresh set out, the ribs there will compete with any I have had anywhere else.

Last but not least, is choice.  They have 3 rows of buffet and a cook to order section (It was okay but not the highlight).  My son is not a big foodie, so it is usually hard for us to go out anywhere but an Applebee's or equivilant and that gets boring.  This is not a straight chinese buffet.  They had nuggets, wings, onion rings and fries just to name a few options.  This means everyone in my family had something to eat and we all left happy.  And leaving happy is the most important thing when going out.. Smoky, meaty, authentic food.  Really amazing cuisine served up by a friendly staff.  I had the steak sandwich (rib eye) with potatoes.  There are only about 7 seats inside but also some tables on the outside.  The decor is nothing fancy, but the food is the real deal. I would give them 5 stars, but I had a half hour wait in line, then a 35 minute wait for my food.. Wow!  I would give 6 stars to Juan's Flaming Fajitas & Cantina if I could.
Thank you Yelp..never would have found them without you!

Best experience in any restaurant EVER no matter the cost, country or nationality!  From the moment we walked in at 3:15 in the afternoon we were treated like long time customers (that tip very good) It was truly amazing.  The hostess girl at the front desk was so sweet and so nice and our server super nice, helpful and FAST... my only caveat is to be careful with the roasted peppers that come with the chips and salsa...Very HOT! Whew! but I recovered fast...  We arrived in time for happy hour and were happy to see red wine for $4.50 a glass and decided to do 4 different happy hour treats from the special menu.  We do this from time to time at different restaurants as we eat our dinner early so we don't go to bed with a full stomach.

When the food came we were shocked at the size of the portions! they were huge and each came with very generous portions of avocado and sour cream.  We had the fajita nachos and fajita quesadillas, shrimp cerviche and something else I don't recall.  Every thing was delicious and full of meat.  The cerviche was delicious, cool, refreshing and with lots of shrimp and avocado in it.

The red wine was tasty and everyone (including both the manager and the hostess) came by to see if everything was OK, at which time we gave them a total thumbs up!

We ended up packing up enough for us to have a light lunch in a day or two.

I can't recommend this place highly enough.  Excellent experience!. One thing that has impressed me the most is that They do take customers reviews. Excellent job in food quality and service!!!. Ok, ok, you got me Mr John. Seems like when lunch time comes around, you just happen to have a location that is conveniently nearby. I have been to this location several times before you guys decided to close down to remodel and boy that seemed like forever. Now that you guys are open, I see that you made the place even better. I think out of all the other locations I have been to, this is definitely the biggest one.

As for the sandwiches, you cant really go wrong with any of them. Except maybe the veggie sandwich. Come on man! What kind of sandwich is that if you don't have any meat up in there? To me that sandwich does not exist except for when I mention that it doesn't exist in this review.

I basically have 4 sandwiches I order as a normal rotation. They are #8 Billy Club, #14 Bootlegger Club, #16 Club Lulu, and if I am really hungry, The JJ Gargantuan (it's so much meat that giving it a number was not gonna be enough).

Sure I can go on and on about what is in these sandwiches but I don't want to waste your time. Just stick to this rule of thumb: If you like ham, roast beef, turkey, and bacon, then any one of those that I mentioned will definitely satisfy you especially the JJ Gargantuan. This monster has salami, ham, capicola, roast beef, turkey and provolone topped off with onion, lettuce, tomato, and Italian dressing.

Pro tip: If you refer to their menu, there are freebies that you can have them put in your sandwich like onions, lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, sliced cucumber, hot peppers, dijon mustard, yellow mustard, oil, vinegar, and oregano. If your sandwich does not normally have these items, they will not put it in your sandwich unless you specifically tell them to. Same thing for freebies that are already in your sandwich. You can order extra of that item. Also don't be afraid to ask for different bread. They give you the standard white bread with all your sandwiches but you can ask for wheat or the traditional sliced bread.

Service will always be lightning quick because of a couple of factors. All the sandwiches they make are cold so there is no time wasted in cooking or heating anything up. Secondly, they have an assembly line type of set up so you have different people taking turns putting stuff in your sandwich.

The only thing that takes that one star away is that because they don't have any hot sandwiches like meatball or a cheesesteak. I love my usual sandwiches but sometimes I gotta have something hot and fresh off the grill. Until they make that happen, it will always be 4 stars from me.

Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #66. The hotel room was nice: It was a two-bed suite and it came with a table! It was very spacious, with a bathtub, shower, and a spacious bathroom as well :)

Poker and blackjack are better here than most other casinos from what I hear. I think they have relatively low minimum bets at Mandalay Bay if you are not looking to lose a ton of money (or win a ton if you're lucky).

There are plenty of places to eat and a nice Starbucks on the first floor!. Was a great place to go the morning after a hangover. The food is moderately better than your typical buffet but the deserts are what set the Carnival apart. the velvet cake (especially carrot) was amazing and the gelatto was great. I'll be sure to come back next time I'm in Las Vegas.. What can I say - it's Starbucks, the only thing missing here was the knowledge of my usual drink from the baristas at the East Blvd location!

This is not the Starbucks located at Checkpoint B - but this one is located going down towards Terminals D & E mixed in with all the shops.. I can't speak for a typical Wynn Las Vegas experience. I have never stayed in the main tower and dealt with the supposedly slow elevators and/or smaller sized rooms.

When I went, I stayed at a fairway villa at the country club in the two story wings that extend out from the tower. These rooms are amazing. At approximately 3000 sq ft, plus an additional 2000 sq ft of deck space, these are truly the most magical rooms I have seen in Vegas. Usually they go for 10,000+, but sometimes you can get a good deal!

And-- special tip: the first floor villas have private pools (but they aren't willing to give these out to just anyone, which unfortunately, I am-- I'm just anyone).. $2.50 Old Style and Bags.... What more can you ask for.. Great customer service and amazing prices!!!!

I walked in knowing exactly what I wanted to buy and the customer service that comes along with purchasing is beyond GREAT!. Best calzones in AZ.
Fantastic wine collection and a huge assortment of antipasto, cheeses, meats and Italian premium foods.
Will definitely be back to eat there and buy produce there also.
Fantastico!!. Yesterday I got my first tattoo with Ed. My girlfriend also got tattoos done with Rita and Ed recently and both were great. We aren't artists by any means, so they fancied up our designs and did an amazing job. Everyone there (including Jess, the other artist, and the receptionist) is very friendly and I'll definitely be going back.. The food was nothing short of phenomenal. The staff is nice, along with a great atmosphere and possibly the best happy hour menu around (3pm-close).. Late night high quality food. Been here several times and they dogma good job.. This place is great. I've lived in AZ for 10 years now, and this is probably the best mexican food I've had in the valley. El Bravo, I'd describe as a dive restaurant. It's one of those places where you walk in for the first time and wonder if you should turn right back around and walk out. Don't make that mistake. It's definitely not going to win any awards for decor/atmosphere, but if you want great mexican, this is the place to go.

The service has been very good to date, and the family is always friendly, as you can tell they appreciate their customers. Keep it up El Bravo!. OK HANDS DOWN.....In my opinion the pizza here is amazing. The Di Fara Pizza is by far the most flavorful pizza I have ever had. In addition to that.... the Mediterranean Salad that we started with is absolutely perfect. All in all, great service with great food.. The best! Now I really miss Home. The Chicago Mix is the Best!. excellent service. each time i've been there they have been really helpful and have given me discounts when asked. great place. Love this place! The employees are always so incredibly friendly. Especially our favorite blizzard wizard BREI!! She consistently makes the best blizzards, that always live up to the "upside down" test they do.. We had a great time watching Monday night football, food was great, I recommend the crab, it's awesome. If you bowl this place is for you!  Bowl-A-Vard Lanes was the last place my Dad and I spent quality time together (mid Jul-13).  He enjoyed bowling and pool in his younger days so it was the perfect place to take him.  He was amazed and impressed with their 40 bowling lanes.  I'd have a beer and bowl a round there any day.. How lucky I was to miraculously find Hog's Heaven BBQ when in all actuality I was driving to a BBQ competitor close to my house Shanes rib shack.  Long story short one of the owners of Shanes passed away so they sold it to Hog's Heaven.  I used to love Hog's Heaven at their old location in Aliante but their spot was hidden and wasn't garnering enough business to stay open.  Sad day when  it closed, euphoria when I stumbled upon their new location.  Like the old location, the new kitchen is staffed with the same masters of mesquite and likewise the same jazz and blues music from their old location comes bellowing out of this kitchen.  You can sit down to eat or grab and go.  The service is remarkably professional for counter ordering and the restaurant is clean.  Ribs are a must get-amazing flavor ask for extra sauce.  Pulled pork sandwich is good but the ribs are the star of this show.  Sides are hit and miss, it's almost worth while to save room for MORE ribs.  Tried the cornbread but it's not homemade and I love fried okra but like the cornbread they were not homemade.  There's only so many hours in the day and the folks at hog's heaven spend it wisely on their ribs.  When these folks have a firmer grasp of the needs of their new location I would love to see them make more of their items in house.  Maybe I should be happy they don't though or else I would have BBQ pulsing thru my veins and be one fat pig.  For the time being though, I am back in Hog's Heaven !. I was in need of a delicious meal to help me recover from Oktoberfest @tempe town lake.  A bagel sandwich seemed ideal so I searched yelp for everything bagels (cause I love everything bagels) and found this place.  Enthused and hazy from many beers the prior evening around noon I got the courage to leave my bed and make the journey to everything bagels.  I got their lox bagel sandwich on pumpernickel bread (The New Yorker) and iced americano and fresh squeezed orange juice.  Everything was great the lox was perfect the bagel was like a bagel should be not like that Einstein's BS, New York style FANTASTIC. The coffee was also good in fact I was going to give 4 stars but that rude woman who gave them 1 star because they don't have a cold brewed coffee is crazy, yes cold brewed coffee is delicious but coffee over ice is not terrible it was fine.  So to help boost their star rating they deserve I give 5 stars.  I will def be back again to try the other egg breakfast sandwiches, one more thing I got a Hawaiian bagel to go cause it sounded intriguing and it didn't let down it was like a kings Hawaiian roll in delicious bagel form!!!. After taking three weeks off this Summer to travel, I was worried about going back to the gym.  Greg knew just the right way to handle it.  He backed my weights off a little and then steadily brought me back up to where I was before, paying careful attention the whole time so my workout was neither too hard nor too easy.  It turned out to be a lot faster to get back into shape than I thought it would be -- thanks to the way Greg handled it.  Greg constantly changes what I'm doing so I don't get bored.  He and the entire ETS team are true pros, and are exceptionally nice and professional people as well.. This is a man's man hair salon.  From the overstuffed leather chairs to the flat panel TVs to the free beer you are welcomed with, this is all manly comfort.  Oh, by the way, my haircut and scalp massage by Shelby was super and relaxing too!!  I guess this is a new location but you'd never know it.  There are so many other great shops and restaurants in Ballantyne Village that you can visit as well while you're there.  I got a great haircut there and will definitely go back.. Best boba place. Love the white gourd tea hot and the taro milk teas as well as the mango slush!!! All my shit. Limited Menu, Fun staff and great vibe. Ohhhh... the food? Really good and I dare you to get a level five spice meal!. Really classy ambiance, though a relatively casual restaurant.  Lunch was delicious. Fideo - like Paella, but with angel hair instead of rice - was outstanding....and only $12 on the lunch menu.  The Tres Leches for dessert was amazing too.  Friendly staff.  Highly recommend as a nice little treat in Ballantyne, just outside of Charlotte.. Problems resolved and I received a sincere apology

I received a call from Ashley, their Supervisor for Member Relations.  First, she made no excuses, apologized, and said the cross-state experience is something they are working to fix.  Second, she offered to correct everything along with providing a discount to earn my wife and I back as customers.  Ashley's kindness won me over.

Within a half hour, Ashley had cleared my account and Tiffany from AAA's Web Team contacted me to fix the online log-on problems.  I am now able to access my account online.

Very good comeback.... service and food was awesome but here is the catch, any steak more than $30 tastes the same. (no matter if it is aged, organic etc ...) and basically you pay extra for service and the name ;). This is probably the cleanest goodwill you will find in the valley and staff are a bit more friendly and helpful here and won't kill you with their looks when you ask them for help like the staff in the tropicana store do. Found a Kobe Bryant authentic number 8 jersey for 3 bucks and complete steam iron for 5 dollars.. We went for the "Tuscan Tasting" option which offers a sample of the best/most popular items from the menu.  Also went for the wine pairings which at $40/pp is not a bad price considering the wine list can best be described as "not cheap".  The meal started with 2 oysters each which were very fresh and topped with a bit of caviar to add some saltiness.  Following was a very thin sliced raw swordfish marinated in citrus and topped with a bit of greenery, truly excellent think Shusi done Italian style!  The pasta was hand rolled and served in a wonderful Bolognese sauce.  Not a large dish but just enough. Then on to a grilled sea bass which was also very fresh and perfectly cooked.  Many reviewers mentioned the rack of lamb and that is the main choice on the tasting menu currently and it is really superb.  I think it is a slightly more mature rack than is typically served in restaurants and as such is larger and stronger flavored which when combined with the spices and roasted made it just the best. The 2 ribs served each was plenty.  The desert selection was perfect and provided a nice ending without being overfull.  Total tab with the meal, wine, tax and tip came to $322 for two plus $26 at the bar beforehand.  Oh yes, you can see the dancing waters from many seats but not all, so if that is important be sure to reserve well in advance.. My go to F&E. What isn't to love about F&E. U can't get all your food here that u need but what they do have is great. Awesome staff and store is always nice and clean.. Food, outstanding service pretty good when they come around, but they need a bigger place to handle the traffic 20 minute wait turned into an hour I fell asleep waiting that sucked! But glad to see they are kickin  gourmet  burger ass!. New York New York had been my Hotel & Casino for many years till I stopped visiting Vegas for a few years, last year (September 2014) I went back to Vegas and I could not stay at a different Hotel & Casino than New York New York. Well, it is still awesome as it used to be and maybe more. Great and very clean rooms, good restaurants, good and not crowded bars, variety of shows, great customer service and clean and ample casino. The only star I am not giving to them is because the gentleman at the check in was really really slow, while other cashiers attended 2 or 3 people he just attended me; I would say it took him more than 30 minutes. Otherwise, NY NY is my place in Vegas and it has been for almost 20 years; and I will be back again this September 2015!. One thing to remember about this place is you get what you pay for.  I have always stayed here and even though the beds feel like your sleeping on stacked cardboard.  I bring my own pillow and throw, because it can be a bit chilly here in the winter.  But if you want to spend $300+ for lavish amenities without the continental breakfast and free parking, go for it.  I am sure there are other B&B's out there that are better, but I have to say, I enjoy stepping into a shower and having it feel like I am being sandblasted clean.. You honestly just need to check this place out yourself. Always available equipment, always clean and a friendly crowd. If you're a fan of fitness and need a place where you can get in and get out without being bothered, this is it!. Why didn't my college have one of these!?

Okay, maybe that's because we have a puritanical 21 year old drinking age and our exorbitantly priced universities would rather give bonuses to administrators than subsidize student boozing. (Whoops, I think I just answered my own rhetorical question.)

But what a place. The food is three stars on a good day but very cheap, as are the beverages. The old wood-paneled spaces have a grand feel to them and the little spiral staircase on the end charmingly connects the two floors. I came with a grad student friend and we were back again a few days later.. Was driving down the street today and looked to my right and was like....OMG SHORT LEASH DOGS!!!! I had been wanting to try this place since forever. 

IT DID NOT LET DOWN 

I created my own, and I wanted to try everything! The staff was super friendly and they served it up quickly with a long line behind me. I can not wait to find them again.. - No sign telling you where you are. 
- Open until 5 AM.
- They sell PBR dispensed in red cups
- The irony of having a restaurant that sells $5 slices of NY style pizza next door to places like Jose Andres' Jaleo and Estiatorio Milos.
- Limited amount of seating.

Everything about this place screams hipster, and normally I would avoid places like this like the plague, but turns out that it's pretty damn good. Someone bought a whole pizza for the room, and after we come back from the clubs at like 6 in the morning, I find a half-eaten, cold slice of pepperoni and sausage buried under some paper...still amazing. This pizza passes with flying colors on the time test.

Later...instead of eating at Jaleo, I get a strong hankering for pizza. Hot and fresh out of the oven...effing delicious.. Each floor of Club Graing is like a bar with its own crowd and personality. The basement is for CS/ECE majors hacking away in the linux lab and people who are completely buried in their textbook rather than facebook (and cell phone too because its hard to get reception down there). First floor is for non engineers who can't log on to ews computers and an eclectic mix of  always stressed-out looking people on the west study area. 2nd floor open area is for people who like to read and take notes (i.e. not engineers). The crowd in the open area is pretty academically diverse, but the 2nd floor pink and green study areas, frequently populated by minorities, are not. No one really studies on the 3rd floor besides people who like to look over to the open 2nd floor area or when the library is completely packed. 4th floor is like a more productive version of Club UGL. It seems to be frequently populated by CEE students, but that might change when they get their own student center in the fall. If you stay there late at night (around 3pm), it becomes a gathering place for various ethnic groups where people either make beds and forts out of couches or have a WOW LAN party.. they got the best steak in the WEST!!!! every time i go to Vegas thats one stop i dont miss.....the staff is super friendly and helpful..... Bloody mary bar that kicks butt!!! Beautiful waitresses too..... You can not beat the Garlic Teriyaki Shrimp with sesame seeds with Wasabi Ranch to dip them in!  It is a must have!  They also have cajun shrimp that are awesome too.  The wings are unbelievable and they are not small! The Whooli's sauce will light you up.. it is hot.  I love this place!!  Oh and Kelly is the BOMB!!. Worked with Ron here. Quite knowledgeable about different mattresses, and more importantly he LISTENED to our sleep style and offered accordingly rather than just let us lay on everything. Went in "not buying anything" left with a wallet $3000 lighter. Cannot wait to get our new Tempurpedic tomorrow and get back to sleeping good after another mattress store stuck us into a mattress that is far too soft.. Wow. this place is absolutely great, you can't beat AYCE Prime Rib for $9.99.  I think it's a max of 2, but still you get pretty damn full even off the first one. It's about a pound or something like that -- and you get the sides and salad. Probably one of the best budget dinners i've ever had in vegas, sh*t was amazing for the price.

The 7.77 is okay, it's not as huge as the prime rib but it comes with 3 pieces of shrimp or so.  For a smaller appetite...which obviously isnt mine.  The prime rib is just so good for the price and it tastes great.  The morning after though, i wouldnt say it was pleasant.. Husnu's is the real deal.  Though I only tried their deserts I was overjoyed to find perhaps the best home-made baklava I have ever tried.  It was not overly soaked in sugar, delicately flavored with cardamom and other yummy spices.  Husnu came out of the kitchen to greet us personally.  Then again, I was making a giant fuss about how awesome this baklava tasted and ordered a few portions to take back to Florida.  I was delighted to find that Husnu threw in a few extra 'ends' to round out my portion at no charge.  I was eating baklava for days.  Incidentally, it traveled very well and tasted great even after flying a thousand miles south.  My only regret is that I don't live in Madison and cannot get more of Husnu's amazing baklava.  The Turkish coffee is superb too!. Matthew is that neighborhood barber I've been looking for.  $16 cut, shoulder massage, and an old fashioned foam trim on the sideburns and neck.  All your worries are wiped away as you walk into his shop and back to a simpler time.. Roy's Hawaiian Fusion is one of the best experiences I've ever had at a restaurant.

The food was excellent.  Some of the best food I've ever eaten. Take time to experience a full course meal here including appetizer and dessert. Ask the server what is good for the day as well and they'll be honest and tell you what is being done well that day.

The atmosphere is very laid back and the service was excellent. Roy's is going to the very top of my favorite restaurants list. I hope the other locations are just as good.. Quite possibly the best burger I've had. How many times have you ordered a burger medium rare and it comes out pretty much well done? Not here. My blackjack burger (ciabatta bread/jack cheese) was THICK and cooked perfectly, a little crispy on the outside and very JUICY on the inside. Even the included skinny fries were pretty good. At $14 it was totally worth it. I also had a twinkie milkshake (great idea). It tasted great, but probably not worth it for $9.. I love this place. It's a family owned restaurant with a great menu and excellent quality food.  The lunch hour can be busy but it's worth the wait!. I walked up to Baja Fresh Express in Terminal D at 7am on a Monday morning. It was clean and there was one dude behind the counter. Being a daring eater, I grunt out my order: "Breakfast burrito, no meat." He says "Do you want papas (like on the menu) or do you want eggs, pico de gallo, beans and cheese?" I was all like 'yeah whatever you just said I want the second one." Homeboy totally hooked it up.  The tortilla was so huge the thing was triple wrapped. A couple hours later, I was floating home over the clouds in a burrito coma. Damn that place is absolutely clutch.. Best California burrito in the game!!! Seriously some fine Mexican food, and it's always friendly in here.. Wow just amazing. Best hole in the wall, the food the food..  Just awesome the service out standing. .Meatballs from heaven! !!! I will make this a weekly stop!!!. Best place to get pierced in the valley!! I have been pierced by Shane and he has been the most professional piercer I have ever met. He takes his time and makes you feel comfortable, letting you know what he is doing along the way. He defiantly takes pride in his work! The shop is VERY clean and comfortable and has a nice selection of jewelery. He also has some great tattoo artists that have tattooed some of my friends. I would recommend this business to everyone!. Excellent customer service & product knowledge. The staff is friendly and solution oriented but not pushy even though they make commission. Great selection and rarely out of stock but if they are your order can be delivered to your door at no extra cost. My experience here has made Finish Line my preferred store for athletic shoes.

Only problem is I have not made it out of the store spending less than $100 yet. Do not take your wife or girlfriend with you. After all.. it is a shoe store.. Grethel was awesome!. Jean Philippe is absolutely superb. The food is of the highest quality and the flavors are complex, varied, and most importantly delicious.

I've only ever had desserts at Jean Philippe but I would have to say that's what you should be getting when you go there. I've tried some of their chocolates which are very good, and a friend once had their creme brulee which he said was top notch as well and cooked well.

But my favorite thing at Jean Philippe has to be their gelatos/ice creams. They are some of the absolute best ice creams I've ever had as they are just so full of flavor that lingers just long enough in your mouth for you to truly savor the wonder. My friends and I agreed that their cookies and creme was one of the best ice creams we've had in our lives. I'm also a very big fan of their dulce de leche

I should point out that the Jean Philippe at Aria and the one at Bellagio do have slightly different options and some of their flavors presumably rotate.

Can't recommend Jean Philippe highly enough. I've partied at many of the mainstream clubs in Vegas.  I partied at the Act on a Saturday night with friends and loved it.  The venue is small by Vegas standards and definitely doesn't hold as many people as the large clubs.  However, it has everything you like about the larger clubs with none of the downsides.  There was great music pumping all night.  While there really isn't a dance floor, there is a large stage that everyone is able to dance on.  My friends and I had no problems finding places to dance in this club.  Drinks weren't as expensive as at Marquee or XS, which I really liked and on this particular Saturday night women received free Vodka drinks before 11pm!  Once every hour the bouncers clear the stage and an "act" comes on for 5-10 minutes.  The "acts" seemed to range in risk factor as the night went on.  Throughout the night people in bizarre costumes can be seen walking around and interacting with the crowd.   What I really liked about this club was that there weren't tons of creepers walking around trying to jump on every woman on the dance floor like you'll find at the large mainstream clubs.  I could definitely see the act catching on and becoming a must-go place in vegas this summer.. The kiddo had a blast.  Hell, I had a blast! Sometimes it's the small things in life :) Sundays are cheap if you ask for the $7 admin and $7 upgrade.  Works out to $14 per person without the arcade. We go a la carte on that as we keep the 4 yo busy with the rides!  The other patrons can sometimes be a bear...it's a huge place.. This pub is nothing short of amazing! 

The full Irish breakfast with an Irish coffee is the ONLY way to start off your day. Follow that off with a pint of Guinness and your off to the races!

After several more pints I ordered the Guinness stew.  All I can say is WOW! Smooth, delicious and full of meat and vegetables.

I followed that up with several more pints of Guinness, so I really don't remember what else I ordered. The staff here is amazing. Very friendly and they really go out if their way to make you feel at home.

If you do stop in, sit at the bar and talk to Cyril. You will NEVER find a more sincere, nicer bartender in your life!. Jessica took great care of Chumlee! They got me in on short notice, didn't take long. They have a waiting area of you choose to wait there. I'll be back!. Decent pizza. Got a deep dish of buffalo chicken but it was prepared with tomato sauce. Still was pretty good. They'll make pretty much anything regardless of if its on the menu.. Was in the Linq hotel last night,was waiting for a cab to go back to my hotel,now this was around 1139pm,no cab was around heard some music decided to go in the bar,let me tell you most fun I've had in years,everyone having a great time dancing,the dj was playing good music,I danced my ass off till 3am because that's when the bar Shuts down very recommended spot,and unlike the clubs in Vegas no dress code and admission is free. Above all the service and staff were amazing! The food wasn't shabby either;) our server Sunshine brightened our morning up! And the outside patio is dog friendly!. I really like this location because it is really easy to get in and out without too much of a hassle.  The location on Sam Furr always seems to be very congested, which is why I like coming to this store.  I went today to pick up some pretty basic necessities and was able to find everything with ease.  
I was asked 3x during my hour trip if I was able to find everything,  so it shows they are making an effort.. Once again, a preface...I am NOT a bar fan of any variety.  Sitting at a bar and drinking for recreation is not my idea of any kind of fun time.  A former friend of mine who IS more than a recreational drinker invited me along with another of his recreational drinker buddies to Cattivo for 'dinner'.  Since I don't really have the opportunity to get out much, and never having been to the place, I said 'sure'.

Flat out, I can't comment on the 'bar' aspect of this bar.  I do know it's supposed to be predominantly Lesbian, I can't say whether the drinks are good or not because I didn't drink, and I can't comment on the 'gay' or 'entertainment' aspects because frankly, I don't care for drag or thudding thump-thump dance music, and wasn't there for any...but for me, what this review is about is the food aspect of Cattivo.

If you are a fan of 'bar food', and like it to be REAL bar food, done right, then Cattivo should be on your list for a place to drop by for a quick bite.

While lush one and two sat downing their drinks, talking incessantly and not listening to each other or me if I attempted to join the 'conversation', I ordered the fried fish that came with a side of fries, and the fried appetizer platter, with my usual Diet Coke.

The portions were generous, and more importantly, they were made with care, and were real.  This wasn't a frozen fish patty nuked back to life, or a bag of frozen veggies dumped in the deep fryer to fry and burn.  The fish was flavorful and tender, and the breading was seasoned and absolutely delicious.  The fries were real and cooked just right, and the appetizers (which were plentiful) were chicken wings (nice and plump and juicy without being overcooked,) Provolone sticks (again, cooked just right, crispy and seasoned on the outside, gooey and tasty on the inside,) zucchini (in strips, ditto to the rest,) mushrooms (ditto) and they served it up with some ranch dressing for me, which I always prefer over marinara sauce.

Honestly, the fish was tastier and more reasonable in price than anything I've ever gotten from Wholey or Benkovitz.  

If you're around Lawrenceville, and you're looking for a really good end of the work day fish sandwich and a side of fries, in a pretty calm and relaxed atmosphere, and you don't mind doing it without seventeen TV's blasting sports coverage at you, then this is definitely a good choice to make.  

I can't speak for the 'bar party hour', but I can speak for the basic dinner hour, and some very good and reasonable food.

Just one warning to the health freaks.  I smoke, and in my own life generally I don't smoke indoors at all, but Cattivo does permit smoking in the bar and restaurant.  So if you're the type that starts coughing at the sight of an unopened pack of cigarettes deep in a vending machine, this might not be the option for you.. Called in an emergency situation and he made time in his busy schedule to help me out in a bind.  Took extra time to be sure the job was done right!  Saw his reviews on yelp and took a gamble that they were not paid to post a positive review.  I can say this service and these reviews are the real deal.  This is an awesome service and company!  Paid a little more than a coupon discount with another cleaning service, but it was worth every penny. Thanks again for all your help!. Always a hit with my out-of-town visitors. The musical show always impresses! I like their pizza. The crust is crispy but easy to chew. It comes out of the ovens in about 10 minutes. When you realize you're getting a theater experience plus dinner, the prices are reasonable.  $20 buys dinner and drinks for 2, with a couple of dollars left to tip the performers.
The organists are very professional.  Atmosphere is very casual, like a German beer hall.. My home warranty company sent Runyon's to my home on two separate occasions.  I'm pretty sure I got the same technician too, George.  Both the staff that work the phones and George are friendly and professional.  My washing machine and stove were fixed without much hassle and are still functioning properly.  My only wish with this place (and just about all the other companies like them) is that they would be more accurate with their 4 hour windows.  Anyway, I am happy with the service I received and would definitely use them again.. It really doesn't get any better than this.  The only place I will go - If you want to try yoga or you've been practicing for a while,  you will be glad that you went here.  The staff is great.. I am now a huge fan of Switch. This awesome steak and seafood house located in the Encore was one of the finest meals I have ever had in Las Vegas. It's also home to the largest wine list I have ever laid eyes on.

Our server, Will was one of the main contributing factors to this as well as the amazing food and a restaurant ambiance that hasn't seen it's equal. 

Will was very patient with us as we looked over the menu. The level of quality service that he provided was astounding. He offered thorough explanations as well as suggestions on what we should try. We ended up ordering the lobster mac and cheese, green tea spiced ahi, and Montana bison. Yes, bison.

-Vermont cheddar mac and cheese with Maine lobster: $18
A very perfect portion of the best mac and cheese this stomach has ever digested. We both don't like mac and cheese but loved this one. The lobster portions in here were nicely cut and prepared. 

-Green tea spiced ahi tuna: $42
This was served with lentils and endive. It was a HUGE cut of ahi. Very fresh and seared to perfection. The green tea added a nice dimension of flavor here. I've had a lot of seared ahi in my day but none like this. Amazing.

-Montana bison rib eye : $48
This was served with a very nice port wine sauce. It was cooked medium well and it remained juicy throughout. The bison was very lean and tasted very clean. It had no gamey taste at all. Very impressive.

-Caramelized profiteroles : $12
Think of these as very small cream puffs. I had never heard of this dessert before dining at Switch. The puffs were full of flavor and very light. It was the perfect way to end the meal. We didn't want to get bogged down at all: we had shopping to do.

So why call this place Switch? Well every 20 minutes the restaurant itself transforms. Wall panels give way to one of three different types and even the ceiling opens up and recesses to give a different point of decor for the discerning customer. This was a very nice touch and although I knew it was going to happen ahead of time thanks to Yelp reviews, they can't really prepare you for the real deal. I had never seen anything like it before in my life.

So thank you Switch, Will, and Montana bison for a culinary experience that will always be remembered.. I like this Eat'n Park. Even though it is a chain, not all of them are created equal. The wait staff and kitchen staff really make a big difference in whether or not an Eat'n Park is worth patronizing.  Eating here, I change my mentality a bit. I always order the seven dollar BBQ burger with the salad bar add on for two dollars. In my mind, I always see myself ordering the seven dollar salad bar with a two dollar hamburger. When the salad bar is kept stocked, it has some really good and fresh items. I love that they have spinach and not just iceburg lettuce. I wish other Eat'n Parks were more like this one.. It may be a depressing thing leaving the strip, especially when in search of food. You just don't feel with the in crowd anymore. Thats what it feels like when I was going to Panevino.

But you could look at it a different way. Maybe time away from all the slot machines and drunk kids playing blackjack isn't a bad thing. Panevino was nice and quiet when we got there. It's dimly light with a very elegant environment. I think the greatest thing about Panevino was the view of the strip. It really allowed you to take a step back and look at Vegas with all its bright lights and flashy decor.

Their menu is simple and not cluttered with a billion things you can order. I like that.
We ordered artisan bread as a starter to feed our group. It's awesome finger food. A friend described it as 'whoopie cushion' bread. You kind of wait for it to deflate or pop it yourself...depends on your mood or how you did at the tables I guess. Then rip away.

I got their blackened chicken rigatoni. It came perfectly al dente and the pasta has such a good bite to it. Homemade. The sauce was great. I normally expect most pasta dishes with chicken in it to contain a bunch of overcooked meat. This wasn't the case...I can't stress how soft the chicken was. It's like god himself cooked it with his bare hands while he was playing the slots and drinking a brewskie. Totally worth it and very good.

Good place to go if you've grown tired of all the glitz and the glam...IF thats even possible.. YAY! Downtown has another thing to love. Great thai food next to Don't tell Mama.  Cute design, and wait for it.....outdoor dining in Las VEGAS!! It's about time we got some outdoor eating.  The Panang was great, PAd Thai was awesome. Great space. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu. Viva Downtown!. Solid. Portion sizes are moderate but very tasty. Prices are very reasonable.. As a former vet tech, I have had the pleasure as well as opportunity to see how the place is run from the inside out. It was one of my first jobs out of the Army and boy does Dr.Benesh (B) run a tight ship. I have never met another Dr. who emphasized continuous education  in whatever way possible. He wouldn't make me feel as if I was ever bugging him when I would incessantly inquire about the latest procedure or an article that I came across. He truly has a passion for animals and it's apparent through the way that he conducts his business. 

There were a few comments regarding his belief system but I wouldn't care if he worshipped daisies as long as he treated my lil "baby" like he does each and every animal that comes through his doors. I know that the man has come by l8 night to check on certain animals, waive some money/fees that was owed for services because of the customer's circumstance, and even let a Dr. go because he felt that they were not the best representation of his company. I too was let go, yet I have nothing negative to say about this man, his wife Ginny, or his business.

He's been in the community for many moons and has proven himself as an efficient doctor who sincerely cares about what he does. I can't say that about most people, let alone doctors.
When the animals are boarded, they're looked after by the kennel help, vet techs, and sometimes even the receptionists would  take the animals for a "walk about".. This is a pretty sweet location as far as Walgreen's goes. It's conveniently located around the corner from my house so I come here quite a bit for essential items. They have a large pharmacy and selection of over the counter drugs, of course, but they also have everything from groceries to beauty supplies.

I stopped by for a propane tank last night. So glad they happened to carry these, I needed one for a camping trip and really didn't feel like going to Home Depot or Walmart since it was so late.

This is also one of the quickest, most convenient places to return a redbox movie.

There always seems to be some sort of sale going on or a big clearance aisle stocked with bargains. 

Every time I go there are really nice employees working, so I'm going to assume this place is pretty well managed.

Trust me, they have everything you need. Great store!. took my team to las vegas to celebrate a good year of lots of hard work and ended up with an hour or so to kill before we all went to see Mystere. since we stayed at the bellagio, i was able to make it back and forth from Caesar's palace mall in time and bumped into burberry. 

normally don't review places like this but geez, what service.  i was due for a new wallet. the last one must have been made of cheap leather or something because it wore out too fast. i have a lot of burberry stuff and liked the looks of their wallets so was going to go with that.  made a pathetic attempt to wait for a sale by postponing my purchase till after xmas.  note to self: burberry wallets don't go on sale, ever. 

futile attempt to get a discount abandoned, i needed to haul my butt into a store to buy one at retail price. so here i am. and for buying a wallet, they really give you amazing service.  they sent me - not only thank you emails - but actually sent me a _handwritten_ thank you note , hoping that i was enjoying my new wallet from the sales lady that helped me, with her card included!  wow.  definitely a creative way of motivating people to come back to the store next time they visit vegas.. Wasn't aware they opened for breakfast a few months ago but SO glad they did!  We had the chicken and waffles, which were fantastic.  Looking forward to going back to try some other early morning offerings.. The product was enjoyed by our Pittsburgh family.  The delivery was there for everyone to enjoy and the three flavors that we had ordered, Cheese, Carmel and Movie Theatre were equally enjoyed.  Excellent place to do business with excellent service provided.. This Restaurant is like Heaven, The Food is really good, and the Staff there are really nice. A lot of people though. My family and i Visited Lindo Michoacan this past Summer because of the Review But we had to Wait for a about 20 minutes. We were about to leave. But then they found a great table for us. I got to see how the hand made tortillas were made from that Table.( They got alot of Kool Mexican decorations. Lindo Michoacan doesn't disappoint, But over all its The Best Mexican restaurant in Nevada. Incredible customer service, prompt and knowledgeable. They make you feel important and welcome as you make your service selections. Will definately return. FYI - If the product you are interested in is out of stock (which is not very likely) be guaranteed you will get it asap. Thanks. Great service!. Ok, so here is the deal...this place is a hole in the wall, a dive, yeah it's not pretty.  BUT the Touchstone Rose is one of my favorite bars in Charlotte.  Why?  Here's why...they always have great drink specials, they have a huge patio with its own bar and flat screen tv's so you can smoke, the bar staff and waitresses are cute and good at their jobs, and to top it off the food is GREAT!  It's mostly a typical bar menu but they do it better than just about anyone in town.  A few things they do different though....they have a fried bologna sandwich that is topped with chili and and egg that rocks.  They are the only place in Charlotte (that I know of) that serves a Louisville Hot Brown sandwich.  If you've never had a hot brown...stop what you're doing now and go there!  They are nothing short of awesome.  Also, they offer to grill your hot wings.  Which I thought was a little strange because I'm picky when it comes to my wings.  But, it's really good!  The crowd is mixed but of Fridays and Saturdays it's pretty crowded after 11:00pm.  Overall....if you haven't been to the Touchstone Rose you should!. I'm not sure why they changed the name of this place from red brick pizza to Sano Brick pizza.  Anyway, it's pretty good,  the staff are polite, and it didn't take long to get my pizza when I stopped in after a long bike ride.. Excellent food and service. Beer list was limited but they had Four Peaks. Highly recommend.. Great burgers , French fries and walking distance. To my house ! 
A  great addition . Some of the staff I recognize from other stores .
Good food and Service .. A lasting tribute to a man termed "America's Pastor" and a place that will forever carry on his lifelong evangelical mission. Unlike a Presidential Library, this is not simply a collection of artifacts and photos that comprise the life of one of America's leading Christian ministers; rather, it is a progressive presentation on the life and mission of Billy Graham focused on his continuing efforts to spread Christianity all over the globe.

You enter the gates just off Billy Graham Parkway and are given a welcome packet / parking pass. Admission and parking are free. After parking, you head to the complex past the restored Graham family home down to the barn with the giant cross. In keeping with the theme, you enter the building at the foot of the cross, greeted by door holders, who refer you to the central counter for ticketing (free). Reservations are recommended, but not required. From there, you are sent to the front right corner of the building to listen to a talking milk cow describe Billy's early days and then ushered through a series of video and memorabilia rooms where the story of Billy Graham and his mission are told from youth to modern times. After a series of presentations, you are then guided through several self-paced exhibits culminating in a trademark of the evangelical crusade: a call to salvation. After this final presentation, you are walked out to an area where they make counselors and prayer rooms available. There is a final bookstore / gift shop at the end of the tour. 

Inside the main barn are several counseling stations with representatives and staff willing to help with both your visit or spiritual needs. There is a large cafe available as well.

Returning outside, you are encouraged to tour through the restored Graham family home as well as the gravesites of Billy's wife Ruth and several leading members of the Billy Graham Evangelical Association.

Takes about 60-90 minutes to go through and the landscaping is absolutely gorgeous. Soft music is piped through the outdoor gardens and is a very respectful place to meditate or spiritually reflect. Very well done. In total agreement with all of the other Yelpers who praise this place.  Unfortunately, I don't live in the area - if I did, I'd be here at least once a week if only to chow down on that red rice.  I've made a vow to come here on every trip to Vegas and I'll try something different every visit - except I'll always have the red rice, of course.  Darrell makes you feel at home and give this boy props for opening up something different than the usual fast food, chain-type places.  Food is served on real plates with real silverware - no plastic or paper here.  It's also cooked to order so be prepared to wait (in anticipation) for some great home-style cooking.  Well, home-style if your home is Guam!  Go for it - visitors from elsewhere, tear yourself away from smoky casinos and bland buffet food for a real treat.. I stopped by this pleasant little shop for lunch with my wife and I could not be happier. The atmosphere is very personal, the deli is small but the seating was comfortable. I was blown away by the variety of South American dishes that were available. I had the Venezuelan platter, two different empanadas, and finished off the meal with the best flan I have ever had the joy of tasting; my wife had the Cuban sandwich and she also enjoyed some empanadas. The staff was very friendly, it was truly a joy to dine here and we will be doing it again!. Hello - I have been using the 20/20 Eye Center for as long as I remember.  Last week for my annual visit was predictable except hey had a new technician, Laura, who was charming and made the pre-exam upbeat and a lot of fun.  My exam was with Dr. Charles Kesner this time and did a fine job of the exam and advising me of the results.  Without going into my details I was on the cuff of getting new glasses or not as fortunately my eyesight had changed little since last year but enough to get a recommendation.  However during the exam and seeing the family photos I learned Dr. K and his wife had adopted five (5) yes 5 girls (who had been born into bad situations - we will leave it at that) to give them a good life.  These young girls (by the photos seemed 5-7 years old) looked happy and many photos were as a family unit together.  I wasn't going to buy the glasses but seeing that I figured anyone willing to such good for others deserves good karma back so I got the glasses.  My point here is the 20/20 vision center is a good facility as I have used them for years but if they have DR's working there that care that much about others then I know they will care about me also and give me the best exam and service for my eyes.  So if you haven't had your eyes checked in a while - give them a call at 480-526-7037 and make an appointment with Dr. Kesner.   Thank you Jeff H

BTW: While posting this review I read the other ones and was shocked at some of the negative comments.  I have never had bad service nor felt pushed to buy new glasses.  Laura (short dark hair) was very nice and only worked on getting me glasses after the DR made the recommendation and I said yes - she was not pushy even giving me the option of taking eye photos or not (but good they did as they found a potential issue).  They had checked my insurance so I only paid a fraction of the cost of the glasses.  My review is a solid '5' and if I could give them a '6' I would.. Nice new gym - lots of machines, big basketball gym, pool, and a good childcare. Everything is nice and clean and new. The employees are friendly and it doesn't get overly crowded. My only drawback is that the Group X room is kind of long and narrow and seems a little small. Other than that, I'm a fan.. Le Pick-Up un dépanneur? Oui, on peut dire ça. Un snack-bar? On peut dire ça aussi. Quoi d'autre? Un repère à hipster? Un endroit atypique? Un restaurant inclassable? Une cuisine surprenante? Oui.. on peut dire tout ça aussi du dépanneur le Pick-Up. 

Il s'agit donc d'un comptoir restaurant situé à l'intérieur d'un bon vieux dépanneur de quartier. Si le concept peut surprendre, on oublie souvent que ce drôle de mélange était très courant dans les quartiers ouvriers des grandes villes du Québec. On y venait pour casser la croute à midi, et pour y faire ses courses à fin du "shift" de travail. C'est donc ce concept rétro qui est conservé ici dans toute sa simplicité. 

En gros, je dirais que la cuisine du Pick-up est surprenante et inventive. J'ai mangé un sandwich au fromage haloum grillé avec salade de choux. Très bon. On dit de l'endroit que la spécialité est le sandwich Pulled-Pork, alors je me promets d'y revenir pour y gouter. Un dernier mot sur l'ambiance atypique. Lors de mon passage ici, un groupe électro-underground jouait en sourdine, ce qui ajoutait à l'atmosphère très hipster de l'endroit. J'adore. 

À visiter absolument.. Very helpful and knowledgable staff. The prices are actually lower than you can find on the web. I wanted to buy a new controller for the irrigation being fed up with my old one. The staff actually listened to my problem and offered to check out the old one to see if it could be fixed. They checked it out an offered a cheaper solution which did not require replacing the whole thing. You can't get this service at home depot.. Went looking for a universal garage door opener, and ended up getting it cheaper at Wal Mart. For all other purposes though, this is a good HD.. This theater is our favorite theater in Charlotte. Yes, the movies they show are a little more selective, but the SEATS . . . yes you heard me . . . the SEATS are unbelievable. Comfortable, leather rockers that allow you to seat back and enjoy a movie, the way it was supposed to be enjoyed. The popcorn is ALWAYS fresh and the people who work there will do whatever they can to make it a most enjoyable experience. They want you to come back . . . they really do.. Food, service, and a constantly changing beer list is awesome! The bartender Kara is always on top of everything! Best reverse happy hour you can find anywhere! ---at all the locations! Great place for food and drink at a more than reasonable price, late night, Come here!!!!. Some of the most gorgeous servers I've seen on the Strip. I wonder if they double as other functions in the evenings.

I was hoping there'd be swim up blackjack, but unfortunately it's just a regular table ($10 minimum). It does get hot during the day under the cabana. Also, white sangria is a good way to cool down.

Oh, and European style sunbathing is allowed, ladies.. We were going to see a show last night and were running short of time. The staff got our meals out very quickly. We ordered four plates between two people and that was more than enough. Good is of exceptional quality. I took my kids here last weekend the day it opened and can I say this is the best park I've been to in awhile. It had everything and more, they had such a great time. One thing I loved is how they have so much to do their and the two different playgrounds for ages of kids, it was really cool for the climbing web that goes around and the 30ft tower. Before leaving we ran up hills and went to the water fountain that was beautiful and put on a show. Kids got their face painted and ballon animals.. Kung Fu Tea was absolutely incredible for a boba shop in Vegas. Everything from the drinks to staff were really great and the Bruce Lee Kung Fu themed caught me by surprise! How cool!


[Location]
In the Chinatown area (yeah, apparently they have one in Vegas). Next to a ramen house (delicious), Korean BBQ place, Japanese curry, and Big Wong Chinese Restaurant.

So if you find the Big Wong, then you're definitely close to the best balls in Vegas.


[Drink]
I ordered the Green wow milk with mung bean. After checking in yelp I got free topping so through some balls in there! Alright!
-Balls were the real deal. Just like the top boba places in SoCal.
-I enjoyed how they provide you the option to adjust the amount of sugar in your drink per request. Very mindful.

Place was clean, plenty of sitting space, and all the staff were fantastic.

[Kung Fu Themed]
-I LIKED how the monitors played kung fu clips. I LOVED the bruce lee figurines that apparently they sell as well. Took a few shots because they were just bad ass. 


WHEN IN VEGAS....YOU NEED TO GET SOME OF THIS BUSINESS. THE BRUCE LEE OF BOBA DRINKS. TRIP TO IT IS ALSO WORTH IT BECAUSE THE ASIAN RESTAURANTS IN THE SHOPPING CENTER LOOKED ALL GOOD. WE'RE GONNA GET SOME OF THAT BIG WONG NEXT TIME. SERIOUS.. I have not been to the DMV in quite some time....well...not since my last renewal.  I have to admit...I am impressed the remodeled and expanded location.  I find absolutely nothing to complain about as I write this review.  I was in and out pretty quickly.  The line was long...but they quickly opened a few extra to accommodate the customers that were waiting.  Also...I have to admit....It really pays to have your paper work in order!  so go prepared...make their jobs a lot easier...and faster!!!. I've suddenly developed an irrational fondness for hot dogs, and JJ's Red Hots has become my Sistene Chapel for hot dogs. And not just your typical boiled or grilled hot dogs, but hot dogs all dressed up and ready for the big dance. In this regard, JJ's doesn't disappoint. 

I opt for the Chili Cheese Coney - chili, cheddar cheese, and onions - and the Whistle Pig - bacon, cheddar, onions, mustard. All this with a grilled Sahlen's frank, and you can't go wrong. I can't go wrong. If you don't want one of their signature dogs, no problem, you can build your own. Any topping, go for it!

Great atmosphere, too, tastefully and eclectically decorated. Not only do I enjoy the dogs, I enjoy eating here.

There are plenty of good places to get a hot dog in the QC, but JJ's just might be the best, or at the very least, the most original.. New to a city and need car repairs- is my middle name. Its hard not being a car guy but having your own and you're wives car to take care of. I always feel like I cant trust anyone who has the ability to repair anything on our vehicles since I wouldn't know any better. I need an oil change fast so I took in my VW Jetta. The guys we're really friendly. Read a lot of mixed reviews all over and talked to the manager about them when I got there. They fixed Thompson (my car) up real nice and no problems after like I was nervously expecting. I'd go there again.. I cannot emphasize enough how awesome this place is. Traditional German beer hall. The food is outstanding, I've never had a bad meal. The bier cheese needs to be tried. 

Beer, let's be honest, this is why you come here. Two sizes, liter (as big as your head), half liter. All brewed on premise. 4 always on tap (my favorite is the Dunkel) and a monthly beer. 

The staff is also a blast. From the rocking house band, to the polite wait staff, to the imposing security, everyone is nice as can be. Get up and jam. You can dance on the benches until your legs can't hold you up, but stay off the tables. 

I recommend this as a stop anytime you visit Pittsburgh. When you are there, ask for Big Andy and tell him Neil said hi.. The best burritos in Charlotte. Period.

If you are in downtown and in the mood for a burrito just walk in here. You'll thank me later. :)

P.S. If you are an Indian and you find the burritos in other places kinda bland, you are gonna love it here.. awesome p[lace. Gut bestückte Bibliothek auch zu Spezialthemen. Als Ergänzung zur Universitätsbibliothek sehr gut zu gebrauchen.. Just purchased a pool table and called Billiards 2U in the AM to schedule the move. Dan not only answered the phone but was able to do the move within an hour. His guys, Daniel and Parish showed up in the truck and took the table apart promptly and professionally and placed it in the truck ever so carefully. They really know what they are doing - they disassembled the table like clockwork The slate table is actually in 3 pieces and they removed the screws and the old plaster that was used as a sealant. They had to take off the felt and side pockets and all of the old staples and removed the bumpers, The set up went flawless as well as they leveled the table very carefully and used beeswax to fill the cracks and cover the screw holes. The felt was stretched and looked better that the original as they hid all of the staples. They also were able to hook me up with balls and cue sticks as they carry inventory. They took a personal check and were on their way - total time about 2 hours. I highly recommend these guys for your pool table move and they also will replace the bumpers and felt as well. Thanks guys!!!

Bob. I met some friends at this new place this last Saturday. I had never been to the previous Mucho Gusto, but this new place is very good!  The restaurant is decorated in the new "hipster" decor like a lot of new places in the area.  It doesn't bother me too much, I let the food tell the story.  The food was great!  I had the braised chipotle rib.  very tender, lots of flavor.  The corn and beans that came with it was very tasty! Being not a fan of most "Mexican" food places in Tempe, this place isn't authentic Mexican, but it is well done! We also had some chips and guacamole. Those were good as well.  Service was pretty good. We all enjoyed ourselves.  Plus some live music playing some 90's hits.  Drinks are little on the pricey side would be my only complaint.  But, I will be back to try some more of their yummy food!. Great repair shop.  I took them my iPhone 4 that the front glass had broken in at lunch today.  Not only did they fix my phone, they gave me a loaner phone for the afternoon. AND they stayed past closing time when I couldn't get down before they closed.  

I hope I'm never in a position to HAVE to use them again.  But, if I am, they're the go to guys!!!!   

Thanks, David!. The service here is phenomenal. The entire staff makes you feel like you're a part of their family. I recommend you make your way here. I've been 5 times in the last 2 weeks.  thank you for providing the best service in the Gilbert area. Furthermore the Pizza is AMAZING!!! You can't find pizza this good unless you're in Brooklyn!. My wife and I always enjoyed the food at The Place at their previous, smaller location, so we were happy to hear they expanded into a larger restaurant.

We were also pleased that they were open for dinner most of the week, so we went in to have breakfast for dinner (they do have a dinner menu, but they serve breakfast all day, so, heck yeah.)

Long story short, I got the steak and eggs breakfast a 12 oz steak, two eggs, hashbrowns, and pancakes. For twelve bucks. I likemy hashbrowns well done and unlike most places, the waitress listened and they were great.

The steak was outstanding, I believe it was a sirloin. A 12oz steak for $12 bucks?? You can't beat that, I don't care what it comes with.

The staff was great, the restaurant was clean, everything was top notch. I will definitely return.. Interesting location. Excellent food. Great beer. Waiters are very nice people. Really injoyed my stay.. My fiancé and I were visiting from Europe and wanted a manicure & pedicure off the strip to save some money.  We were told that Nails Today had great service and attention to detail.  We were not disappointed.  Ben, Nancy and Mia run a very professional service that rivals anything you'll find at a resort spa at half the cost.. My buddy brought me here for a quick lunch. He ordered something for me that I never would have tried: the crazy potato. I was genuinely surprised; in the words of Dora the Explorer: "yum, yum, yum... delicioso!" 

The place was clean, the staff pleasant, and atmosphere above average for a quick-stop eatery. 

If you are in the neighborhood, don't miss this place!. I really like Sushi wa.  The prices are pretty fantastic, and the quality of food is always top notch.  I am never disappointed when i come in for lunch or dinner.  The only issue I have with this place is that customer service is a little iffy.  The older woman there always seems angry and upset.  I really like the younger server.  She is really nice, but when the older woman is working with her, she tends to yell at the younger one and gets really awkward.  Other then that this place is awesome.. Rare beef steak soup aka Pho
- it was OK, best pho in the area but there's better in Chinatown
- lots of meat was included

Mini chicken plate 
- GET IT!

Service was great, my water was constantly filled. The place was very clean.

There are two sides to this place a sit down and order from the menu side and an order first. There's so much food on the menu, from Chinese to Hawaiian to Vietnamese. I still want to go back and try more. Their menu you is tremendous!. This bar has friendly service, good but slightly-overpriced tequila, and a good mix of usual and unusual mixed drinks.  It also has lots of seating, plenty of bar space, and just-dark-enough ambiance.. Great place !! I was blown away on my very first visit, not only great service but amazing customer service, and it has stayed this way. They have great barbers who do amazing work !! If you are considering visiting Fino's stop thinking about it and just do it !! you wont regret it !!, I recommend Fino's to everyone, I even tell women to tell their husbands or family about Fino's. Thanks Fino's for keeping me looking good, and feeling  even better !!. Other than the sign I always pass when I'm leaving the airport, I rarely pay this place any attention. What a nice surprise this place was! The museum has enough for kids and adults, even if you are not an aviation enthusiast. They have military and civilian planes, jets, and helicopters although I can see from previous posts, this place always seems to be changing, which is great for us locals. 

The Museum did a great job documenting, preserving, and depicting the "Miracle on the Hudson", all the way from its crash landing, to its journey to Charlotte. Quite a fascinating story. 

Make sure you speak with the staff inside the hangar, and ask questions. They are kind, extremely knowledgeable, and are always quick to share a story or "little known fact". These guys are the hidden gems of this place. 

I will be bringing future Charlotte guests of ours to this place for a long time to come.. Always had great food from here and great service.  Today they comped about $40 worth of food because their payment system was down.  That's awesome.. Things I ate at Ha Long Bay (one night, 2 people)

- Pork & Shrimp Spring Rolls
- Golden Tofu
- Pad Prik King w/Shrimp
- Drunken Noodle

Things that are amazing to eat at Ha Long Bay
- Pork & Shrimp Spring Rolls
- Golden Tofu
- Pad Prik King w/Shrimp
- Drunken Noodle

Based on this evidence, it appears that everything at Ha Long Bay is amazing to eat. We have been looking for a good, local Thai restaurant and we think we've finally found one. Plates are around $10-$12 each. The food is fantastic and the decor is very nice.. Hands down the best meal I have ever eaten! We had a great 4 course meal with steaks, beef Wellington, and a dessert to die for! The service was 5 star and the staff was outstanding including accommodating us with our 6 month old son!! Never been treated better! Would fly back just to eat there!. Thanks for the great service!! Ask for Trish or Charlie, they will show you what friendly service should be. Charlie was a great server and Trish went out of her way to make us feel welcome in our recent visit to AZ.. While staying at Hotel Missoni I of course have to give the lounge bar a try.  It seemed moderately popular with a 30s well dressed crowd over the weekend.  The cocktails were well done but a bit pricey (and I live near NYC!).  Service was hit or miss when they got busy... Atmosphere is pretty nice.. Disclaimer: I'm pretty good at ping pong. This place has it. What makes ping pong even better? Beer pong. They let you do that, too.

The bartenders were very friendly and offered quick service. I really enjoy the place when it's not too packed, so you can enjoy the dive bar ambiance without running into Zonie d'bags.. I was talking to a friend about how much I loved Ruth Chris Steakhouse and he suggested I try this place.  My wife and I finished up watching a movie and a steak just sounded good so I wanted to give the place a try.  

After finding out it was my first time the manager came and offered me a free appetizer which was way cool of them ... to bad I am not a huge fan of Shrimp cocktails, but the gesture was amazing.

I ordered the 10oz filet which really was melt in your mouth goodness.  Its about 10 bucks cheaper then the filet at Ruth Chris but I have to admit I still like the steak at Ruth Chris better.  BUT DONT GET ME WRONG this was an amazing steak, its just hard to beat Ruth!!!

I also had the sweet potato fries which were amazing served with some kind of sauce that I still am not sure what it was, but it was amazing!!!  

My wife had the sirloin and said it was really good too, and we both agree we will be going back to this place.  The service was tremendous and friendly and we got right in and the food service was quick.  

A very good place for an amazing date night!!. Perched atop the 64th floor of the majestic Hotel at Mandalay, Mix boasts some of the best views of the south strip in Vegas. Once you set foot inside the lavish ivory themed dining room, you know you're in an Alain Ducasse restaurant. The space simply oozes the charm and elegance of his signature opulent style reminiscent of the dining room at the Hotel Plaza Athénée in Paris.  The glitz and glamour of Vegas is also quite apparent and you can't help but be dazzled by the contemporary and elegant atmosphere that envelops you.

With the beautiful weather I had been  experiencing over the weekend, I opted for patio seating with a direct view of the Vegas strip below. 

After glancing through the menu, I decided  to try Chef Ducasse's signature Tasting Menu with wine pairings.

Breads came out soon after with a selection of focaccia, French baguette, dinner rolls and sourdough with unsalted and an interesting "peanut" butter. The breads were room temperature and butters were cold so spreading was not pleasant but the breads served their purpose of filling my gullet til the main courses arrived. 

Amuse

Foie gras royale with port reduction and mushroom foam 

- this enticing little number exhibited a pleasant airiness and irresistible aroma from the mushroom foam and the interesting mix of flavors and textures married well together lending a savory yet earthy element to this whimsically fascinating dish

Gnocci
With Parmigiano Reggiano, veal jus and sun chokes.

Not the best Gnocci I've ever had but satisfying nonetheless. This dish had an incredibly comforting feel to it. I especially enjoyed the contrasting textures from the light & crispy chips and tender enoki mushrooms served with the dish. Warm, rustic yet subtle and familiar flavors were easy on my palate. 

Main lobster curry with coconut basmati rice 

- it's hard to go wrong with lobster, especially when you infuse thai flavors into a dish. The perfectly cooked lobster was bathed in a pool of curry and served stop luscious coconut rice. A delectable marriage of flavors.

Filet mignon Rossini with foie gras and black truffle sauce 

- this was easily my favorite dish of the night. The combination of filet mignon, foie gras and black truffle is like the holy trinity of fine dining.  The result will almost always result in endless drooling and licking the porcelain off your plate. 

Predessert

Coconut foam and mango rum cocktail. An exhilarating drink with bright notes and a sweet finish. Excellent palate cleanser and a perfect way to prepare my taste buds for the sweet finale.

Baba a la marnagnac

Unfortunately I wasn't as impressed with my dessert.
The liqueur for the cake was too strong and pungent while the flavors were just were too heavy handed. I may have myself to blame for that, as I may have given the cakes too heavy of a pour of the accompanying liqueur.

Overall, food was good but I must admit that I expected more from a multi Michelin star chef like Alain Ducasse.  IMO, the dishes lacked that wow factor that I was eagerly anticipating.  Service was also on the clumsy and awkward side the night I dined, as well. For instance, my wine pairing for one of my dishes was completely forgotten until I reminded the sommelier. Additionally, the wait staff seemed a bit hurried and rushed.  The furniture itself, which has probably seen better days, was in desperate need of an update, too. During my dinner one of my guests had to change their seat out because the chair was collapsing. For a restaurant of this caliber, I expected a bit more, at least chairs that weren't falling apart at the seams. 
With that said, they changed the chair out without a hitch and there were some redeeming factors which included the stunning views, beautiful setting and expansive bar next door.  
3.5 stars for now and hoping the restaurant makes some improvements on the menu, furniture, and service in the future.

Until then...

Happy Eats!. This is by far the BEST Tattoo shop in Las Vegas. I got a Koi fish done on my arm and love it! Ed is super talented and I recommend him to everyone. If you're looking for a great tattoo at a great price go to BAD APPLE TATTOO!! all the others just suck!. Just an update for other Yelpers. We were there again this past weekend, and I wanted to provide some updated information. In my last post, I mentioned how safe the Cal is and again a couple of other things justify my opinions and observations. Twice this past weekend, I went looking for my wife to check on her since she is a cancer patient and not doing as well I had hoped. But both times I could not find her but I slowly walked the aisles between the rows of video poker machines where she normally plays. I was looking between the machines and saw her purse and her cigarette case both times. I looked at the credit meter on the machines and she had active credits and money in the machines, but the seat was empty. I asked the women sitting in the adjacent seats where she was and they told me that she went to the bathroom and they were watching her machine and her money for her. This was twice that I again personally saw/experienced this. 

And one other thing.....my wife said that late on Friday nite (or rather Saturday morning) at 3:00 am, she was playing near one of the entrances/exits from the casino and she was by herself playing since it was very late. One of the security guards, who as I said was armed, stopped by her machine and leaned up against the wall and just waited and watched her as she continued to play for about 45 minutes. She told me that without asking her, or she asking him, my wife knew he was providing security for her since she was by herself, is pretty weak in her condition, and she was very near the exit/entrance. Now again I say, do I need to say anything more about the security at the Cal? They are the best casino that I have ever experienced over 40 years in providing guest security and customer service. 

And the food again was outstanding. Well, to be truthful something things are good and some things are not-so-good. This is to be expected, but I will comment on the good. Their Friday nite special which is Chinese pork ribs (char siu ribs) is excellent. We always order two dinner portions and split one and take one home for later. In my wife's condition, she does not eat much anyway. And I fill up on the salad and condiment bar since their stuff their is pretty good too. On Sat, I had my special treat for dinner since the chef knew it was our anniversary and he personally asked me last month what I wanted him to make as our anniversary meal. I told him Osso Bucco since that is my favorite meal --- ever! He said you got it and we had that for dinner on Saturday night. Osso Bucco is not on their menu and they never make it since it is costly to make and too labor intensive, but as a favor to us, he did it. I brought a very, very special bottle of Italian Super Tuscan wine with me for our meal and it too was very, very good. I also brought a bottle of Kettle One Vodka for the chef since I knew he drank that. 

Last comment -- on Sunday nite, we took a couple of friends of my wife to dinner at the Triple-7 brew pub. Again, we ordered the old standby menu choices and shared among us. We ordered a full rack of ribs with bbq sauce, we ordered an order of fish and chips, and we ordered a platter of selected (by us) nigiri sushi choices. We also order ahi poke (raw tuna marinated in a special sauce with sliced cucumbers, sliced red onions, and a good amount of high quality seaweed) and a larger order of Japan Hamachi sashimi. You might be thinking, "what a screwy combination of items to eat for dinner!", but as an expat Hawaiian, we enjoy the cosmopolitan menus offering a combination of all kinds of foods. Everything again was very good. Again, since we have been to this establishment a zillion times over the years, we know the menu by heart and know what is good. So these are some of the good things, but some things are admittedly not-so-good. Next trip I will make it a point to go drink some of their in-house brewed beers and have that with their own brick oven pizzas which are also excellent.. Went for drinks and to enjoy the view.   Both were excellent.. Solid spot for stir fry. Service is average, but the food is why it gets four stars. Really good bowls. No major complaints.. My wife and i joked about just what Modern BBQ could be?  Fusion or some other adulteration of southern BBQ?  We entered with trepidation.

And we were wonderfully surprised to find a modern, almost nightclub ambiance, comfortable and easy on the eyes.  Hostess seated, we met a very fine Bahamian waiter, Sanfred.  In his soft accent he described the menu, answered our questions and returned shortly to take our order.

The menu had the standard chicken, pulled port, ribs, beef brisket & sausage meats and then a nice selection of sandwiches, salads, appetizers and sides.  Good job and the descriptions were excellent.

Iced tea was served in glasses and refilled via a fresh glass...rather than the splashing, ice filled pitchers more commonly found in other BBQ places.  And the unsweetened tea did not need sweeteners, well brewed and not bitter.

We split a house salad which was huge.  Doubt is one could eat a whole salad and any other main since the salad was so plentiful.  Dressings were all house-made.  Excellent.

Beef brisket, a favorite of ours and not easy to find outside of Texas, was excellent.  If you simply order brisket you will get fatty and lean slices, so specify your preference.  My wife asked for her two fatty slices to be traded for lean and this was accommodated easily.  I ordered a two meat combo of pulled pork and brisket and received a good portion of each.

The pulled pork is without sauce, so you can first taste how savory that smoked meat tinted with burnt edges truly is.  Then add one of the four sauces on the table:  mustard, vinegar, KC sweet and KC spicy. The spicy was Goldilocks just right for both of us.

Sides included excellent mac & cheese and creamed spinach, along with a cider slaw.  All three were excellent and served in their own small bowl.  We brought most of the two sides home as the portions were too much to eat given the salad and meats.

Prices were a bit high, but the quality of the smoking, sides, menu options and generous portions validated the costs.  Our lunch for two was right at $50 and that was with iced tea, no booze.

Nice experience and quality without the mob scene found in surrounding more casual BBQ joints.  Will try more items as time goes on, most likely resulting in a five-star rating.. We found a new favorite place on the strip. The Pantry looks like the kitchen we all wish we had. Such a welcoming place with the friendliest staff and the most delicious food. Their maple syrup was phenomenal. It's the real deal!. A truly authentic Mexican restaurant with some of the finest tortillas around.  I don't live anywhere near Tolleson, but whenever I find myself in the area, I make it a point to stop here for a California burrito.  The tamales are excellent, as are the soups.  I've tried a half-dozen things from their menu so far, and I have been thoroughly impressed with every single item.  And the best part is that the cost is very reasonable.

If you enjoy trying new Mexican restaurants and find yourself in the Tolleson area at some point, you owe it to yourself to give Tamales Guadalajara a chance.  It's fantastic.. This is our go-to Thai place in Vegas. And it helps that its just down the street from us also! We have tried almost every dish on the entire menu and everything is very very tasty! Plus the portion sizes are HUUUUGE!. I didn't realize how happy I was to stay at MGM when I realized this place was located right next to MGM!  THANK YOU JESUS! WOW!  It totally made my day.  I went to Vegas for 5 days and I ate here twice and loved it both times.  Price is good, portions are good, service good, seriously, what more can you ask for?!?!?!
Would I go here again?  Definately!!!  You'll find me here on my next visit to Vegas!. I highly recommend Reed Chiropractic!!! I started seeing Dr. Legg a few months ago after I injured my lower back  & neck working out. Having never been to a chiropractor before I was a little nervous at first, but as soon as I walked in I felt very comfortable being there. Dr. Legg is a very  friendly, upbeat, and professional individual, who actually took the time to scan, x-ray, and examine my neck and back. I felt like I wasn't just another patient. After a couple of visits, not only was my pain virtually gone, but my overall movement and mobility  improved as well. I can't thank Dr. Legg enough for what he has done for me.. For those who don't know, Zen Sushi is a food cart that usually parks itself, with all the other carts, in the Memorial Library pedestrian mall - the block of State Street immediately west of Lake Street.  Zen Sushi, and all the other carts, are generally there between 11-2 Monday-Friday.

And it is one of my favorites.

When it shows up.

Pro tip:  Check the cart's Facebook page before heading down there.  They're prone to absences and likely won't show up at all if it's raining, windy, cool, etc.  They also disappear for days/weeks at a time, but they're pretty good at updating Facebook to indicate their whereabouts and the day's specials.

Despite the cart's unpredictable presence, the food and service are great.  The sushi is fresh and delicious, but where the cart absolutely shines are the Japanese stews.  The traditional Japanese curries (not as spicy and a totally different vibe than Indian or SE Asian curries) are wonderful, and the Nagasaki Chicken stew with crunchy noodles is probably one of my favorite cart items ever.  In addition, the woman who staffs the cart is probably the friendliest, most polite person in the world.  

Pro tip #2.  Show up early!  I've showed up around 12:30-1pm to find the cart already closed for the day.  Not their fault at all, the food is great and they're popular!. I love the Chicken Box!  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but it is sooo good.  First off, the staff there are so pleasant and courteous.  Second, the fried chicken is just the best ever.  The sides are excellent.  I usually get mac and cheese and green beans.  The food is ready and hot in just a few minutes.  I always say I'm going to try something different, but the chicken is just so good, I haven't ventured past that on the menu.. When my family and I went to visit some relatives over the holidays, we decided to use Sun Devil Taxi's services to get around when they were busy going out and about. From the experience I will admit that the quality of service we received was especially amazing due to the quality of the drivers and the friendliness they offer was great. I especially enjoy how it was during the holiday season where it gets even more hectic in traffic, but they still keep their cool to offer the great service they do offer.. So I went here not really expecting the best. I am a big buffet guy, and I really know what is a good or bad buffet. Last time I went to Vegas for a buffet, I went to the Wynn Buffet. I honestly thought it was the best buffet in  Vegas, I still think it is, but for $15 cheaper, I rather do the Spice Market Buffet. Same quality, cheaper price. 

My favorites at the Spice Market Buffet included the Alaskan Crab legs, the Prime Rib, the boned Short Rib, the Beef Kabob. As you can tell, I love meat. Any meat that was served at this buffet was well prepared because after a week, I can still taste the juiciness of the Prime Rib. I am also a big fan of the Desserts of this buffet. There was this raspberry cheesecake that made me go back for not once, twice...I honestly went back for fourths. THEY HAD A COTTON CANDY MACHINE! That was a first for all the buffets I have been to. 

So all in all this buffet was perfect from the multiple arrangements and options. They had Mexican, Italian, Seafood, Middle Eastern, Asian, you name it, they have it. The only reason I am not giving it a perfect 5-Star rating is because it was not like I saw a Shark Tank or had 5-Star furniture. Nonetheless, I came there to eat, and eat I got.. This place is under new management and is awesome!!  If you enjoy socializing with your friends, bring them here and bowl, drink, etc. -- its very nice and a ton of fun!. Very good service and quality sushi, only issue is that it is a little bit more expensive than other AYCE places ($25 for lunch).  Also, the location on the Yelp map is waaayyy off, use Google Maps if you want to find the correct location.. This place is amazing. Old fashioned Las Vegas experience. On the house wine (all you can drink), which I definitely took advantage of. ;). Very good fish n chips. Server was pretty nice. She joked around about Janel getting busted. But I was very turned off by the attaire that the staff was in. Girls were in a short skirt boobs basically hanging out. I understand its a pub n all but coming from Ramsay I expected a little more. I saw Dr. Keeling-Johnson and was very impressed with all aspects of my care.  The whole facility seemed well run and worth trusting with my health.. I frequent this place for breakfast often. You can't really get anymore for your money Monday-Saturday if you are looking for a hearty breakfast with lot's of variety. The food is decent in general and I would say it is very good compared to any other buffet. The place is very clean and has a picturesque montain view from most tables. I have been for lunch as well and I am always impressed by the variety and the quality. The kicker for me is the gelato station with all the flavors and fixings. Who else has that, it's really great.. The patties they use must fall from heavens farm house. Those things are seriously that good. Combined with the perfect amount of condiments and absolutely amazing shakes they earn an easy 5 stars in the arena of classic American grub. The prices are crazy cheap considering they are located inside of a casino. 

I went in with the family one day and couldn't decide on what i wanted to order, so i ordered two meals. HA! Don't tell anyone :) I ate the royal burger like it was my last meal on earth then slowly enjoyed one of those gourmet hotdogs. I decided to go with a half and half shake and combined banana and chocolate. After eating myself into a temporary food coma the bill arrived and i felt guilty. I couldn't believe that I had enjoyed such a serious meal at such a comical price. If you have kids they get hats and cool cars to color as well. 

If your in the area of the south point you absolutely have to try this place. The only bad thing I can say about Steak n' Shake is the fact that sometimes you are forced to stand in line and wait. Standing there smelling all of that awesomeness is not easy.. I had dinner here last weekend, and decided to order the gnocchi since I had it at Bouchon in Yountville.  I thought it was either overcooked and or dry, so sent it back for another order since it was what I came here for.  The next order wasn't much better, and the waitress and manager apologized and comped me my dinner.  Even though I didn't like my food, I still give them 3 1/2 stars for trying to make it right and apologizing.  The other thing that was annoying was that we ordered bottled water, and they took it away from the table to keep it on ice.  Well the busboy or expediter kept coming over and pouring tap water from a pitcher into our glasses.  The waitress had to keep coming over and tell the busboy not too do that.The atmosphere is pleasant and my wife liked her mussels.  I will have to go back to Yountville to see if my taste buds were correct.  They insist that it is the same recipe.. I use to think that Las Vegas Chinatown was limited compared to LA, San Francisco, or New York. Instead of lacking, it is less condensed and noticeable. Ronald's Donuts is a perfect example of that. It is not located in the areas topped by pagodas but is in the general area. With a shabby appearance, this place shines because their donuts are so good. 

I had wanted to try three different styles of donuts, so I ordered an apple fritter, a glazed cake loaf, and a dozen donut holes. The total came out to be $3.15 and I left with two small bags of goodies. While driving home, I could not resist and opened both bags. The apple fritter was moist, filled with pieces of fruit, and huge. The cinnamon flavor is present in every bite. The loaf was dense, but did not dry out my mouth. I would probably order the cruller next time because more surface area and less center means more crunchy edges. The donut holes were light and fluffy. The dozen will only cost a dollar. I have a tendency of taking 1/2 a donut, so this was a great way to have a few bites. 

The woman behind the counter was very friendly and answered all of my questions while smiling. For those who are allergic to soy, you will not be able to enjoy their donuts, because they are fried in soy oil.. My friend and I must of waited 20 minutes in line before we got to order.  Do not come in at 7pm on a Thursday night.  Food was decent and staff was nice.. A great place for a quick take out or eat in lunch. Gyro's are large and tasty. Greek salad is excellent with lots of feta. The spanokopita was reheated in the microwave so was not the crispy phyllo that it should be. Baklava is classic and tasty. Disappointed that there is no moussaka on the menu. Fast service from nice people. Small inside dining area and nice patio as well.. Wow. Again, Wow. I had heard about Federal, but kept forgetting to go (there soo many good restaurants in the area). I decided to get some takeout after a hard day at work. We started with an order of the marinated Castelvetrano Olives ($4) that were mind numbing! We also got the house chopped salad that came with prosciutto, cappicola, provolone, peppers onions and a great vinaigrette ($10) and one of the best salads I've ever had! We also got the meatball pizza ($14) that was just amazing. I couldn't believe how perfect the crust was, and this was TAKEOUT! I can only imagine how good it is in house and super fresh. All in all, our bill was a measly $29 and worth EVERY STINKIN CENT!!! I'm super happy to have another great restaurant in the area!. Great food.  Family dining. Good service and price.. Good food, very reasonably priced, great service! And they have prosecco for a great early dinner drink.. What can I say except for this is Italian food done right! This little strip mall restaurant is truly a hidden gem for authentic Italian food lovers. It is a small family owned restaurant and you can always count on seeing the restaurant's owner Pasquale greeting customers and stopping by to see how everything is tasting. A few of our favorite dishes include the Meat Lasagna with meat sauce, the Peppino Special (baked ziti with chicken, veal, sausage) and the classic spaghetti with Meatballs. An additional perk is the option to bring your own wine without the corking fee. This is a small restaurant which seats maybe 50 people total and is a nice family casual atmosphere. Bring cash though as this restaurant does not accept credit/debit.. Walked right in for dinner, great waiter service, exceptional seafood! Loved the crab legs, lobster was fantastic. Good beer selection too. 

Nice and close to the strip, prices are about what you would expect to pay for a good meal in a nice establishment in the heart of the strip.. comparing o with le reve i have to say the stage is better at le reve.. but both shows are great..if you haven't seen a cirque de soleil show these two are the best. Radish is great.  

Perfect stop in for First Friday. Ample parking and bike racks. Dog friendly patio. Awesome concept. My second time in two weeks!

I wish I worked downtown so I could grab a cold pressed juice every morning or a salad for lunch. This place is so good.  I could drink the cilantro lime salad dressing. Awesome staff too!

This is a must try. I spoke too Steve today. I needed some last minute equipment prior to my next five trip. He was very helpful and knowledgeable. The prices are very reasonable even when compared to the internet discount dive shops. I will definitely go back.. One of the best-kept buffet secrets. A little costly than some but it is worth it. Make sure you try the grilled crab legs on Sunday. Oh Vegas how you tempt me with unlimited food and drink all around. First off, there is no shortage of buffets in Vegas, if you have some cash you'll find somewhere to stuff your face until you need to be rolled out in a wheelbarrow. That said, the hard part is finding a good buffet. Sure you can find $5 all-you-can-eat burgers, but if you want quality along with quantity you have to be prepared to spend some more. 

At $30 a person for dinner ($37 Fri. and Sat.), The Buffet at Bellagio is not cheap, but oh is it worth every penny. More often than not, quality falls rapidly as quantity goes up (Looking at you, Luxor) but Bellagio has proven that very good food served buffet style is possible. There is often a long line of people trying to drown their sorrows of losing their last hand of poker in infinite food (just kidding, not really), so be prepared to budget about 30-45 minutes of wait time. When you get inside the space is very well laid out with tables arranged around the central food extravaganza. There is a large staff busily making sure you find a table, that plates are cleared out of the way and drinks are constantly being refilled, and all of them are very professional acting and dressed (props, Bellagio). 

When you do get your food you'll probably be unsure of where to start due to the amazing array present. In short, if you crave it, they will likely have it. Juicy roasts? yup. Stir fry? That too, as are made to order sushi, salads, and Asian, Mexican, Italian, and American comfort cuisine on top of many more. In addition, the requisite unlimited shrimp cocktail and massive split king crab legs are present. The dessert selection is equally as impressive, with gelato, fresh fruit, crepes and pastries as far as the eye can see. 

So what makes Bellagio so different that they can offer high quality food in such a plebeian style? Well, here is where the clients come in. There is a constant stream of people who are willing to spend a few extra bucks for the promise of good food; as a result, food turnover is very high. Fresh food can be seen being cooked right behind the counters and are constantly being brought out. No food is left to sit for hours under heating lamps slowly withering away; it's always fresh and made with care. 

By the end of the meal, me and my entire family were more than happy with what we got. The food was very good, the service quick, attentive and personable with multiple servers stopping by to check on us and even engaging us in conversation. It's obvious Bellagio put effort into making their buffet stand above the rest and it shows. 

If you want to keep eating your unlimited $5 burgers go right ahead, but I know where I will be returning if a major case of the hungry ever hits in Vegas. Shell out the $30 for dinner and you won't regret it, anyways, you can always win it back later in one last round of blackjack.. Set off on a sunny Monday evening with an itison voucher in hand to give this place a whirl and we werent disappointed. On a arrival we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and the place itself was bright and modern. The menu for the voucher was similair to the main menu only excluding the mini mains, so I cannot comment on those. 

We opted for:

Cold meze

humus, Shaksuka, Dolma, olives

Hot Meze

Calamari, Sucuk, Spinach Borek

Nerellom Ascalese Arpeggio Sicilian wine

Everything was really nice and the wine was reasonably priced. The stand out dishes that made us discuss a repeat visit were the calamari, humus, Shaksuka and Sucuk. Even the pita breads were really good. Wish I had taken some photos as everything was reallly nicely presented. 

Could not fault a dish from the hummous to the pitta breads, which normlly for me in meze/tapas etc theres something that is a bit weird or seems have come from a tin. Never a fan of eating anywhere around George Street as I seem to have had a lot of medicore and occassionally expensive meals, but this place is great.. I like bally's...it's a great alternative to Paris...when you can just walk through the hallway and there you are!! the Cafe right by the escaltors that take you down...i love that place...great service and great food!...lots of fun games too. I'm a regular traveler in Vegas with friends & family.  On my 31st visit (not my 31st bday) I yelped found this place and boy was it so delightful to get lost in in all the different trails immediately.  Easy parking, hit the toilet, take a path and every 2 minutes the path forks into 2 other paths. Paved and unpaved, beautiful trails and vegetation in a desert!  During a drought season the river and streams are still running.  
Find a path under the Long Bridge and you can actually walk across the river with your feet just 4 feet under you. Kids would love this outdoor adventure.
After 2 hrs of getting lost, we hit the Nature Center and surprise to enter a state of the art interaction place with many on hands learning.  FREE!!!!  Got to bring your friends & family!. I've been here twice and i must say, one of the more cost efficient ways to get drunk on the strip!

When I went the line was slow to move since there was only one worker and many people not knowing what to order. Everything is right infront of you! the types of drinks they have, prices of cups, BUT they have a menu suggesting mixes of slushy to get other flavors!

The only drink i remember getting was a yard of a big stick (mix of pineapple-something & amaretto) and it really tasted like a big stick! Imo the drinks are pretty stiff even without extra shots, as my friend ordered the same thing with two extra shots, and tasted exactly the same. 

What I disliked was the crazy sugar high crash/ hangover I got 5 hours later haha.

Something you "have" to get when your in vegas!. Simply awesome. A little bit off the beaten path inside Caesars, but well worth the extra walk. We liked the place so much we went back the next night!

Everything is great from start (the chips and dips) to finish (the exotic ice cream flavors). Appetizers come in generous portions. And the ceviches have a healthy assortment of fresh veggies.

I also have to echo another post here which praised the GM. She's keeping close watch to make sure everything is top notch.

So stop debating whether or not to go. Just do it! You'll be glad you did.. This Dollar Tree is awesome! It's usually cleaned and organized and the staff is really friendly. Randy is usually there every day and he is always nice and very helpful.. Mike & Molly's is an old neighborhood bar from before downtown Champaign got all revitalized.  It wouldn't be described as "posh" or "immaculate."  It doesn't have a wall of giant flat-screen TVs so that you can watch whatever ESPN reruns at midnight on a Friday.  (What's on then anyway?  Ping pong?  Curling?)

One might, in fact, call it a "dive", pointing to the graffiti in the bathroom or the random collected detritus behind the bar.  But this dive has a great beer selection and a huge whisky selection, and it's cheaper than the soulless yuppy bars down the road (yeah, I'm looking at you, Guido's.)

The bartenders are friendly and the atmosphere is mellow, meaning it's a great place to hang out and have a beer with friends.  It's especially great in the summers when the students are gone - there's just enough people on the beer garden that it's fun, but not so many that it's overly crowded.

Many nights, you'll find me at the end of the bar chatting with friends when I'm back in Champaign.. This is one of the best animal clinics I've ever put foot in. Dr. Ensign holds himself to a very high standard and I wanna thank him for his dedication. I also want to praise the whole staff and Raquel's professionalism and expertise in particular...I was impressed about her knowledge of felines. She's given me some great advice on how to care for my cat and I love her for that!. I've been here several times and you can't beat the ambiance. True old school Italian restaurant. Simple menu and good value and fun atmosphere. I love this place and go back as often as possible.

That being said, the food is simple and the taste is also. This is not high dining. Odds are you can make food just as good at home, but then, no atmosphere.

The "free" wine is questionable, but by the third glass what the hell do you care! ;-)

At the end of the meal the deserts are really good but the "cappuccino" really taste like hot chocolate. I must say really good hot chocolate, but not cappuccino. 

Great place for a big party dinner.. Favorite spot in all of Desert Ridge.  New menu, happy hour starts from open to six.. I stopped in here for the first time with Emma, and 2 of our best friends after a Superstition Mountain hike. The 4 of us have enjoyed sushi together at multiple locations between Mesa and Los Angeles. One ongoing competition between us is finding the best sushi spot in AZ. I could not give Sushi Kee 5 stars because it is not the best sushi I have had. A few Cali spots I have checked out just cannot be beat in my opinion. As far as AZ sushi however, I think Sushi Kee takes the cake. All 4 of us left here completely satisfied. Prices were right. Portions were generous. Atmosphere was comfortable. Fish was fresh. If you are into sushi joints where screaming at your friends is necessary in order to carry out a conversation because top 40 is blaring through speakers overhead.. ahhem Glue-Raw-Sabi..then Sushi Kee is not for you.. I had open heart surgery after a cath that showed my heart had a blockage that could not have a stent in it. Everyone here has treated me excellent.. LAVO was great! We had made a reservation for 630 and we were ushered right in, on time and the table was ready and everything!

We started off with some wine (pics attached) and Tuna tartar! The wine was really good for the price! The tuna tartar was good but a little cold, which took away from the taste for me a bit. Usually, if it's at room temperature, it tastes a lot better! Well, finished with the appy's I got the Chicken parm. The weird thing was that the pasta had  to be ordered as a side but I wasn't really hungry and just decided to go with the Chicken parm and man o' man did I chose wisely! The chicken parm was the biggest I've ever had! It was HUGE! I have a picture of it on here somewhere and it was big! 

Overall, LAVO was good! It isn't fine dining but the portion sizes are good and the staff was really friendly and great with us! It's a great place to grab a good dinner!. This past Monday, I was in the area and needed a nice cut before heading to the airport.  My normal barber was closed on Mondays, so I turned to yelp to find a place nearby.

The ratings don't lie.  This place was great.  Daniel was extremely friendly, and paid close attention to the details while cutting my hair.  The neck shave, hot towel, and shoulder rub afterward were the icing on the cake, and all that for $15 plus tip.

It turns out that my normal barber shop being closed may have been a blessing in disguise.  I would absolutely go back to New York New York if I'm ever in the area, and I am even considering making the drive regularly and making it my barber shop of choice.  Great job!. My grandpap loves it,
And that's good enough for me.
Don't insult him...eat.. Lola, la la la la low la
la la la lowww laa huh
*great service
*good prices
*terrific coffee
*cool interior
*down the street from my house
xtra theoretical star for being named after my favorite song about a tranny. The Tao-tini ........ Absolute Mandarin, Stolichnaya Rapsberry, Malibu, Cranberrry and lime juice..... Yes !!
Mixed by one of the most outtanding looking bartenders in Vegas. EVEN BETTER !!

O.K., I am 30 years older than 85% of  the patrons of the club, and yes we still had a good time at Tao hanging in the lounge
Great music, but the sax guy playing like a  "wandering minstrel" in the lounge area can get annoying after the first half hour or so. 
I see why the ladies review the club low and the guys give this place an outstanding rating. The ladies are dressed to the max, look great and the guys look like they just got off work. Come on guys it's Vegas - you can look better than that.. Excellent AYCE!!! Will be my new go to place. Have to try the deep fried oreos!!!!!!!. Vegan breakfast heaven! What is better than coffee and vegan french toast poolside in January?! Not much! My french toast was delicious with a nice soft banana flavor and good maple syrup and fresh strawberries. My boyfriend opted for the Wynn burger - a classic hangover friend. While a splurge, I would definitely go back and bring friends along!. Finally got to Salt, and oh my, it was heaven!

It was a special occasion, so we went full tilt boogie, sampling *a few* of their specialty cocktails, as well as a four course dinner.

I started with the beet salad, which was lovely, and the husbear had the sashimi--a little unexpected for this place, but it was quite good.

Second course: I had the pork terrine, which was dotted with pistachios, and served with a hot little mustard which was terrific.  The terrine was indeed very porky LOL; it was nice that it tasted as advertised!  Husbear had the steak tartare, also delicious.

Main course:  I had the hanger steak, served with roasted baby potatoes and some nice crispy onions.  Generous portion of steak, cooked to perfection...really, really sublime.  Salmon with ricotta dumplings kept my man quite satisfied.

For dessert:  a coconut pudding served with a quenelle of ice cream, so, so good, and a nice little cheese plate finished us off completely!

Pricy, yes, but great for a special occasion.  Server was great--knowledgeable on the entire menu, without hesitation, friendly and attentive but not intrusive--just like I like!. Voici LA place dans le Mile-End pour déguster un excellent fish & chip. Le Comptoir 21 est un endroit charmant où les clients peuvent vivre une expérience digne des petits restos de quartier montréalais. 

À chacune de mes visites ici, le poisson était d'une fraicheur exemplaire. La panure est légère et croustillante. Les portions sont très raisonnables pour le prix. On peut choisir son assiette selon deux types de format (régulier ou grand) et d'accompagnement (frittes ou salade). 

L'ensemble du menu tourne autour du concept fruits de mer. Outre le fish & chip, vous trouvez des burgers de poisson, du calmar fris et une excellente chaudronnée de palourde type Maine (elle est vraiment bonne !). Il y a aussi de la poutine au menu pour ceux qui sont moins du type poisson.

Vous l'aurez deviné, lorsqu'on mange un fish & chip au Comptoir 21, les britanniques peuvent aller se rhabiller.

Je recommande.. They also go above and beyond on service.  I showed up at this store thinking I put in a catering order and my mistake I placed it at a different store, they had not problem hurrying up getting me all the meat I needed and canceling the other stores order for me.  Thanks guys.. The best place in the country to have your Ferrari services. All the service guys are awesome. They are honest and they do a good job. I bring my car here from California for service. I'm not the only guy that does that. There is a reason. Rich the service manager is on point, honest, and easy to work with.  He is an asset to this dealership.. Never been there but I do order bulk pipe tobacco on the phone. If your ever looking for a good tobacco that can beat "early morning pipe" by Dunhill, than order-up a pound or two of Daybreak. It's  the best blend for a pipe smoker who wants a great smoke first thing in the morning after breakfast while your on your second cup of coffee. I just hope that when they take my order next time, that they ask me for my email so I can get a conformation number and maybe they'll send this Yankee boy a little bit of  info on what's new.. Purple rice? High in antioxidants? Flaming plate with sushi in foil? Now that sounds like a jamming place for sushi! To add on to all the great ratings, this place meets the hype.

The sushi at first tastes healthy, maybe I was just sold on this purple rice phenomenon, but wow, it was fresh. Not just fresh meaning cool but the actual definition fresh. The OMG roll intros with all the bells and whistles with the flaming plate slightly cooking the eel. It tastes like some old school Filipino BBQ with a finish of fresh fish. The H3 roll was spicy, but refreshing flavor from the sauce.

The service was welcoming with timely check ups throughout dinner. My wife and I enjoyed the food! The food is quality and we will be back since she works in the down town area!. Don't be turned off by the strip mall location.  This place is cute on the inside, clean, and has above average food.  Prices are reasonable and portions are healthy.  Veggie fried rice to go is only $5 and easily feeds two healthy adults.

Service is fairly reliable and not a lot of kids here because it is a narrow dining area (if there are noisy kids, the whole restaurant will hear it).. Great find for full body massage. Way off strip helps to keep price reasonable. If you have the time and the means, would definitely recommend. Really recommend this place especially if you don't know much about vape. I was in Vegas for the weekend and smoked way too much cigs so I decided to look up vape shops and this place was open. All the employees were friendly. Ray and jay were really helpful and patient since I asked a lot of questions. Place was really big and the atmosphere was awesome. They have a LOT of stuff there so it took me a while. My favorite juice was tombstone which is menthol and berries. Spend the extra money on an intermediate  kit vs a starter kit cause it hits better and looks nicer.. Loved the relaxed atmosphere. 
Waiting staff very friendly. 
Food was exactly as expected : delicious!!!!. Man o' man did I have a great time in this place! I felt like I was in a totally new world. I was greeted by Adam who took 45 minutes to an hour of his time to educate me about biking. I learned so much and feel like I can conquer this new-found exercise. It's amazing how many things go into riding to be effective like head and tail lights, helmets, gloves, water bottles and water bottle holders, pumps, LOCKS, etc, (especially since I desire to be a complete bicyclist). I am new to cycling and am very happy with this new experience, having found Sun Cyclery and met Adam. Check this out! He even provided me with a bicyclist's law handbook and another booklet that includes bikes trails and paths. So thoughtful! He looked at my bike (fixie) and told me the tires needed air. I couldn't believe it until he brought out the pump and showed me the psi readings. The bike felt even better afterwards. Another thing he noted was the angle of my seat being slanted downward. He provided an adjustment to level it out. Also, he adjusted the bike to my height and advised me the proper body posture to have when riding. :-) He threw me some stem caps and a Sun Cyclery shirt and sent me on my way better than before. Then he installed my new water bottle holder. Now, my next quest is tackling my to-get list. Overall, a great place with a down-to-earth and humorous owner. Thanks Adam and Sun Cyclery. You guys are great! See you soon!. Delicious food, unlimited biscuits and cornbread. MUST try the apple dumplin dessert. It's a little big, perfect for sharing.. My table ordered: and I sampled it all.

- chicken pot pie with mashed potatoes
(fantastic, but a bit heavy on the rosemary)

- BLT with red fried potatoes
(came with Guacamole. Nice surprise and flavor)

- Chicken soup with side salad
(good homemade taste & look)

- Blueberry Pancakes with bacon
(Fluffy, moist, loads of berries, crisp bacon)

- French toast with sausage
(great cinamon sugar, smaller portion, tasty sausage). I have visited Theory salon many times, and the experience was always great. The decor is clean and minimal, and the stylists were very professional. The salon is in a great location right near down town and the light rail for easy access. I highly recommend theory for men.. Great patio dining! I enjoyed Easter breakfast with mimosas here and had a fabulous breakfast.. Note to self: don't eat here alone.  

What I thought would be a leisurely solo lunch turned into an unintentional pig out.  The plan was to simply have the juicy beef soup dumplings and then be on my merry way.  But when I opened the menu, it was as if I was wearing 3D glasses because letters and pictures were popping off the page and smacking me in the face.   Venison?  Fried lamb? Braised whole fish?  How soon can friends meet me so I can try more stuff?? 

I tried to stay calm and relaxed as the nice lady came over to take my order.  My thinking was that I would come back another time with a group to try more, but then I opened my stupid fucking mouth.  "Soup dumplings, steamed lamb dumplings and vegetable noodles, please."
 
It was embarrassing when it all came out.  At that moment, I wished they offered study cubicle seating so people couldn't see what was in front of me.  Couldn't I just be a pig in private?  Why am I spending more than $30 on lunch today?  Customers just entering must have thought I was being rude by eating before my friends came back from the restroom.  No friends.  No sharing.  All mine.  

I even thought there would be a chance of a group outside that would strip me of my clothes upon exit and march me down Spring Mountain repeatedly saying "Shame. Shame." as a little bell rang and angry people threw shit at me.  It was official! Dumpling King made me go insane.    

This order would also be an effective remedy for people suffering from insomnia.  I was fast asleep in an hour!!. This restaurant is adjacent to a market of ethnic food.
We bought there some tea and henna.
The restaurant has little exotic ambiance however the owner is kind and ready to explain all about the food. We order 5 different plates for us (the wife and the two little pirates), all of them were above average for Iranian in the US.. My love for a great filet brought me to Hank's establishment for a celebratory dinner last week.  My mother was awarded employee of the month at GVR and our dinner at Hank's was partial paid for by the fine people at GVR.

Hank's decor is reminiscent of Circus Circus Steakhouse with the built-in fireplace, but also has beautiful crystal chandeliers throughout the building.  Upon entering, my family and I were seated in the posh dinning room by the kind hostess and greeted by our trio of waiters.  The service at Hank's was top notch and some of the best I've had the pleasure to experience.

The bread basket consisted of both cheese and raisin breads with a great side of butter that was extremely tasteful.  We didn't spend much time with appetizers, however, our server Michael's recommendation on the wedge cut salad with crushed bleu cheese was amazing!  We each ordered our favorites for entrees.

My younger brothers' Lobster tail with lemon buerre was one item that I can almost still taste :)  My 12oz Filet was cooked to perfection and rates as high as any steakhouse filet i've previously experienced.  I ordered it medium-rare with the gorgonzola cheese crust and peppercorn sauce.... simply epic!!! My parents went with a filet & spare ribs, which were both excellent.  

Another splendid addition to our entrees were the sides that accompanied them.  The creamed corn gets mentioned in the Yelp reviews specifically because it is THAT good! It could be the best side dish I've ever had.  I want everyone reading to think of the best creme brulee you've had, now, imagine it made with corn LOL, yup that good.  The tater tots with truffle oil were good and the mash potatoes were equally excellent.

Overall, my steakhouse experiences are intermediate at best.  However, this is one of the best places I've had the pleasure of experiencing and I hope that you can all make a trip to Hank's for some FINE steaks & Martini's real soon.. When it comes to getting a pet a fish is usually the standard place to start.  They offer admittedly only a mild amount of entertainment, but it does offer a cheap test of your commitment to caring for a very undemanding living being.  You may even grow to love fish and their simple nature that never tires of going up and down the same old stretch of water.

Having decided to get a fish you simply must come here as it can't be matched by anything you get elsewhere.  The range is simply unbelievable and despite this the prices are very good.  This is the one stop fish shop.. Does this PlanePort PeopleAirScooter really need 1100 + Reviews?  Obviously so! 

My Second Favorite in North Carolina and Beats Atlanta and Orlando in a lot of wayz!  Usually better prices than Triad International in Greensboro! 

New Improvements are Improving well!  Hardly a Norman Foster + Associates Design, but hey we are not Beijing (yet). They aren't kiddin when they say this is the best breakfast in Pittsburgh. This was my second trip and it just may become a tradition on every visit. This time I got the dessert pancakes that consisted of strawberry ice cream, chocolate chip pancakes, chocolate fudge and caramel sauce. It was amazing but almost too sweet (if that's even a real thing). It was tough to take down before the ice cream melted but I had fun trying! I highly recommend this place. Be prepared to wait a while to get in though. The lines are long but for good reasons.. This is a really nice little sort of Nuevo Southern place but unlike most Nuevo - whatever places it doesn't try too hard it's reasonably priced and pretty much seems to get it right. Our lunch started with some yummy biscuits with apple butter and a three berry (I think three) jelly. I couldn't decide which I liked more. I went with the Lemon Pepper chicken sandwich with fries both were delicious. Mom had the  chicken salad also delicious. The service was fast and friendly. So give them a try next time you think you want Le Peep they're right next door.. Homemade preserves and Bloody Mary mix are great. Eggs Benedict are amazing, tried my friends order and I was jealous that I ordered the sausage, tomato, cheddar omelette because it was so dry. Besides that great surroundings and wait staff.. I purchased a 10" LED bar from this store, I wasn't so sure about the product so I asked the employees working what they thought about it. They mentioned an employee that worked there loved the product, so I made the purchase. Couldn't be happier, it looks great and super bright! The employed had first hand experience with the product which helps when buying aftermarket parts! Would definitely return to this store!. If you want to eat real traditional Mexican food , this is the place to go......very very good food and excellent service ...... Came here for a bachelor party and got a cabana.  Definitely the way to go.  

With a fairly decent minimum ($2500 min) we got a sweet cabana with a tv, xbox and fridge.  If you have the money go for the cabana otherwise you are sitting in the sun the whole day, there are no other umbrellas.  Our table girl Dyanna was awesome and very attentive if we needed anything.

The music was amazing and the place was packed, loved the experience.  if you have the chance, check it out.

My only was its a little difficult to find in the Venetian.. So we went into the geisha house for the first time on our day night and used a group on. I didn't have my id and couldn't sit at the bar and thought I wasn't going to be able to use my groupon for the happy hour but the manager came over and said that we could sit-in the main dining room area as long as I wasn't trying to drink any alcoholic drinks. Sounds fair to me . This place is really nice, romantic ambiance. The sushi was delicious and fresh and the service was premium. Sometimes when we use group ones people treat me weird but they treated us with respect and kindness and for that we will be back again, even without the group on ! :). Had dinner at Cibo this evening and sat at a duece in the bar area and had one of the best, low key, enjoyable dining experiences within recent memory. Just a very chill weeknight, excellent service, food and ambiance.

Thanks!. This place is great. By far the nicest dental experience I have had by far. Very clean with a personable staff. The doctor was very nice and explained everything well so I would understand. I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone.. Ashleigh is the most amazing trainer! We were so lucky to have our two dogs go through the puppy training! They learned so much.  We looked forward to going to training every Wednesday night.  She is a knowledgeable trainer with a lot of patience and experience!  She was able to give guidance for every issue any of the dogs were having! Every dog in our class improved so much over the six weeks! I'm excited to start our intermediate course! It was worth every cent!  Talk to a trainer and they can get you a $10 off coupon for the training course!. Love this place... It isn't cheap but for a few drinks before heading out this place sets the tone! Great drinks and a really interesting bar menu. The view is sweet and the feel is Hi-Ball Vegas! I will be back.. my new prefunk place. Also, where I will meet other Executives I want to punish with a $300 bar tab.. wink.. Love it!. We were impressed by  every dish that we ordered. People are right about the price, whereas, this place is not cheap.  But this has definitely been one of those instances of getting what we paid for.. Well, it sure ain't the Skala. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Buvette Chez Simone wasn't the first wine bar to open up in Mile End, but it's boldly gone where no Mile End wine bar has gone before: that mysterious two-block stretch of Park Ave. between St. Joseph and Mont-Royal, where distinguished tuxedo purveyors like Waxman rub elbows with head shops, carpet stores, appliance retailers, and other curiosities. When Cocoa Locale opened up on Park a few years ago, I predicted that it marked the beginning of a renaissance for the strip. Well, let's just say that the renaissance hasn't exactly been explosive (and the ongoing construction on Park ain't helping). Buvette Chez Simone indicates that the desire is there, though: this joint has been jumping since the day they opened. And with good reason: the food, with an emphasis on mix-'n'-match appetizers, is generally very good, but, more importantly, the wine selection is very well chosen AND very affordably priced.  In fact, I think you could safely credit Buvette with having started the New Wave of Montreal wine bars:  wine bars that are affordable, young, and positively buzzing with excitement.  Highlights: squash and rapini risotto, a good selection of charcuterie, and roast chicken in quarter, half, or full portions.. Ordered pizza here a few times combination pizza five out of five.  was really fresh not oily at all definitely using high end  ingredients. Had dinner
interior spectacular. service was about a 3 1/2 needs some improvement but overall experience was really nice great job. Who doesn't love Cowfish?  Aside from the strong smell of sushi (I don't like fish) I've always enjoyed my experience here.  I've had their veggie burger, which is great, their fries are wonderful, they can serve up a pretty good drink, and the sushi rolls I created (soy paper, mango, tempura avocado, mango, brown rice, cucumber) were amazing!  You definitely have to give this place a try if you haven't already.. The patio at Lon's is one of my favorite places to eat. We had a great meal there for our anniversary. Started with El Diablo cocktail. Next was a salad with chocolate based dressing. Cowboy ribeye and followed with a cowboy candy bar for dessert. ALL were delicious.  Made for a memorable anniversary dinner.. Nice little place. Friendly and funny staff. Delicious food. Only complaint is that it is hot as hell inside that place. I was literally sweating before I left. I won't go back unless it's winter time.. The chicken is to die for. not sure how they can cook it and still come out so juicy. I am from California and own a property in Arizona. As I was visiting, the restaurant was highly recommended by a friend of mind and it lived up to the hype. Now you guys need to open a restaurant in the bay area.
totally recommend.

Zaid. This is going to become a weekly destination for me.  

It just opened this week and already been there twice  I've been waiting so long to find a place off Strip that serves the kind of breads and pastries you get at fine restaurants.  The search is over.

So far I've had a blueberry muffin, cranberry orange muffin, their pretzel bread, an awesome grilled cheese sandwich on their ciabatta bread, croutons, and their amazing waffles.

All the food is made in store.  In fact, the first time I was there they were baking in the morning so the whole place smelled amazing.  I like the fact that the kitches in open as is the back area where you can see the workers making the days breads and pastries.  

But it's not just about the bread - their sandwiches are amazing.  I loved my grilled cheese and my friends are still raving about the chicken sandwich they had.  

My advice?  Go there...often.. We came in around 6pm not knowing there was a 7pm spring training game, place was packed. Luckily we got the last open table in the bar area. Within 2 minutes of sitting down we had our drinks and chips/salsa. Kudos to the staff and management on being spot on the service. as always the food is very good. We've tried many Mexican restaurants only to be disappointed. Now if OTB will come back to Goodyear with the new mall, we'll be happier.. I didn't know this place had a name! 

Such a fun little convenience store. It's a mix between a Circle K/QT and a drive-thru liquor store. There tends to always be a small line of cars, but the staff will come out to you and get what you need. I really enjoy going because of its charming divey feel, nice owners and decent selection for the size of the store. It seems like they've been around a while and have cultivated a strong patron base.

A couple things to keep in mind:

Bring cash if you can. There is a small fee (40 cents) if you use credit or debit under $10 dollars.

They serve fountain drinks in styrofoam cups of various sizes. Pepsi products only for those.

I live close by so this has become my designated "gas station run" spot. Looking forward to checking out all of the different items they have available in this hole-in-the wall dime off McDowell/87th St.. If your in Vegas and you dont go to EVAN WALLACE for all of your needs then you are missing out! Ive known evan for the past few years and everytime i am in vegas he takes care of me and never lets me down!. I thought I would breeze through but actually, I had staying power.  This is the best entertainment outside of a casino in all of Las Vegas!  Great "erotic" fun.. Best burger I have had from a restaurant ever.  Terrific onion rings. Service was great. Drinks came fast.  It is a well oiled machine that puts out perfection and I expected nothing less.   Gordon Ramsay is a god.. Fantastic Hawaiian BBQ

I still don't get the whole steamed rice & macaroni salad as sides but as far as the bbq-I was pleasantly suprised.

This place has a small dining area but most orders are take-out. 
They also have the largest Hawaiian shirt on the planet hanging on the wall. REAL Cool!

Service is fast & friendly and the prices and selection is terrific!:). I just want to say Oyshi is one of the best All-you-can-eat sushi places around Las Vegas. In fact, a year ago I would have given it a 5 star rating. The reason I only gave a 4 star is because the quality of service has dropped. Largely due to the fact that it has gotten so much busier. There are more waiters but they do not tend to the customers fast enough. The food is great, but for an all-you-can-eat spot, you will enjoy the large menu they offer. The food is always fresh because of the amount of traffic they had. You can find your favorite server and request them to serve you.. Usually requesting anyone to serve you in particular will encourage them to serve you better. I am sure everyone was expecting my 4 star rating to be all positive but I've gone to Oyshi since it opened and I understand the restaurant has grown from what it originally was. The service has dropped a little but they still offer you great food for a great price.. Great service as always. They have everything you need AND using the 20% coupon usually makes them the cheapest!. Fine dining in Scottsdale gets no better than Rancho Pinot, located in a small mall, decorated in what can only be called a quirky manner, and serving food that is often astonishingly good.  Do not be fooled by the faux Western wall hangings - Rancho Pinot is using them to tell you that they are striving for a comfortable feel and unstuffy service.  Take them for what they are.  After you taste the food you won't care and when you finish the meal you will probably ... well you will probably think the decor is still quirky.

As to the food, Rancho is serious about creativity.  They do standard dishes with flavors, ingredients, and twists that make almost everything into an "oh, wow!".  Once in a while they miss, as they did with the grilled striped bass, which they dried out a little going for crispy.  But not often, and even then the sides were superb.

One example: their strawberry shortcake is pretty standard except the shortcake is basically a scone, and it works beautifully.

Expensive indeed, but not too much so for what you get.. Food is so good. Nice big open atmosphere. The portions are very generous as well! Can't wait to try the beer soon!. While I enjoy doing my own landscaping, I was having a house warming party and I wanted to impress my guests.  After looking online for landscapers in Tempe, I came across Adrian on Yelp!  After reading the reviews I decided to give him a shot.  Let me just say that I am impressed! 

I thought that I did a great job, but after he was done, I realized that somethings are just left best to the pros!

He showed up on time and delivered!  Well done!. This location is good.  Always like Papa Murphy's Pizza. Me landing in a steakhouse is like me landing in a steakhouse. I ordered the blue cheese salad, carmelized asparagus and Kobe sliders as my entree which was met with icy silence from our, admittedly, awesome server who went to NECI. The asparagus was wonderful, the salad was salad-like and I was embarrassed to ask them to burn my sliders and they came out 'medium' if medium means purple. Apparently this is how you're supposed to eat these, so no deduction for me being a shut-in. We said no to dessert so our server brought a platter with fried sweet potato doughnuts, salted caramel gelato and ginger snaps. This increased her tip by twice what the dessert would have cost us so props to NECI. The people at my table who more closely resembled adults all were thrilled with their Filet, Sole and pumpkin ravioli. My seasonal boycott of all things pumpkin prevented me from sampling. I had three vodkas to close.. I've been meaning to write this review for quite some time, but our Vegas time got away from us and now that we are back to normal life on the East Coast, I am going to get this done because if you visit Vegas, you must go off the strip and have a meal at this restaurant.  

Truth in lending, I served with one of the owners in the Army and when I found out he started a restaurant in Vegas, I expected nothing but the best because of how detail oriented he is.  

The location is near old Las Vegas / Fremont street, so it will be easy for you to make this a part of your Vegas event schedule.  

The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and the service was exceptional.  My wife and I had chips, salsa, and very good sangria to start.  We then shared chicken enchiladas which were very very good.  

Mexican is hard to screw up, but its also hard to make it exceptional.  They have a great staff and the food is much better than the run of the mill Mexican restaurant.  

Also, we engaged in a conversation with an older couple at the table next to us.  Interesting enough, they were from Summerlin which I guess is like 45-50 min from Vegas and they said this is the only Mexican restaurant they will go to and they will make the drive just to eat there.  

Highly recommend.. !!! ~ CASH ONLY ~ !!!

This place is an absolute HOLE IN THE WALL - but in the good kind of way.  There is no diet menu here.  The Chuck Box is for Carnivores!

Very casual, very open, great outside seating and perfect atmosphere.  they sell beer to help wash down your tasty burger.  I'm hooked!

Parking is limited and the lunch crowd borders on almost our of control.  Get there early!. Let's go Penguins!  

Clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap

Even though I'm a Leafs fan, I do have a lot of love for Pittsburgh even though I think I'm a jinx to the team.   It seems the Pens are in the playoffs when I'm in town for the marathon and I've caught two games over the years.  The first, they lost to the Canadiens at the Igloo.  This time, they lost to the Islanders at Consol.  Sorry about being bad luck for the team, but I had fun at both games.  Plus, I got to see Sid come back and score two goals, so that was awesome.

The Igloo was cool but not very fan friendly.  Consol Energy is awesome.  From the delicious pulled pork to the plentiful beer, everything about this place was great.  The sightlines were amazing, the energy in the place was great.  Sound system and electronic signs were just right.

This is definitely one of my favorite arenas in which to watch hockey (I hate MSG!).  

The design is clean and flows well.  The only negative was getting out took a long time.  Not as bad as MSG but I thought they could improve on the outbound crowd flow.  They do it great at ACC in Toronto.

But that's a quibble.  I love Consol Energy Center and hope to return again.

Let's go Pens!  (Unless you're playing the Leafs). Breakfast was good and the place was clean. Nothing too catchy as far as theme, probably would not go back unless i am in the area.. I have now eaten here several times and I have to say that the food is consistently top notch, and the service is always excellent.  I drive several miles across town to eat here frequently. Definitely. Worth the drive.. Been going here for the last several years. Haven't found a better thai place in Vegas. Love the spice level here. You order a 6/10 and you will definitely feel it, but you won't burn your lips. I find the other places in town go light on spice when they see my pale face cruise in.  Not cool bro... Not cool.. Wonderful food, atmosphere and pricing.. Had a really tasty breakfast!  Highly recommend!!!. One morning my Iphone 5 fell flat on its face and cracked. Not wanting to go the Apple, wait in line, and pay $150 for a screen replacement I decided to search for a phone repair place on Yelp.

I came across One Stop Wireless. When I called them, they answered promptly and was very pleasant. It's a nice change from the hustle and bustle of the busy wireless stores. :-) They let me know that it would take 15 minutes to fix my phone and they had tech's ready to go.

I stopped by a few hours later and within 15 minutes, my phone was back to original condition! :-) I highly recommend anyone needing a phone repair from this shop.. Always good and dependable nachos and tacos are good.. I have been there twice so far.  And will keep going back.  OPA!!!. Tons of stuff from every ethnicity. You dont even know what most of it is but I try all kinds of things. Prices on meat are great, ground beef 1.59 a pound. Beer specials..they had 12 packs of Bud lite for 8.88 3 weeks ago (no help as ur reading this) as an example. Fresh live fish and in a package also. Unknown to most is you can buy fish and they will fry it for free. And whatever ur final bill is they take off another 10% at check out.. We've had bad experiences in the past with mobile cat groomers.  One of our cats can't seem to ride in the car for more than 5 minutes before he gets so upset, he poops.
We found Pat online and I must admit, we were nervous  about it. That all went away as soon as pat entered our home. She had brought a catnip toy and made friends with our two cats right away. She took charge and took our cat who hates water, and some how, she got him bathed, and cleaned like we never seem him before.  Cat two was going to be a real challenge, he hates noise and water, but whatever Pat did, he let her clean him up as well and he never looked better,
Both our cats look great and they are still fighting over the cat toy Pat brought.
If you want your cat groomed, Pat is the lady you should be using, she was and is awesome!!!!
We couldn't be happier with the outcome. Will be using Pat from now on.

Bob & Barbara P.. Lamb burgers were amazing! Service was excellent. We where impressed with the teamwork between wait staff, any one passing by our table would clear used dishes without even slowing down... Great job!. I work in this area and have visited most of the local restaurants in the past few years. Came in at 2pm for a late lunch on a Friday and ordered the Lucia (sausage and mushrooms). Once the pizza is prepared, it takes 90 seconds to cook in the 700 degree pizza oven. For me, the amount of pizza was perfect. Great flavors, cheese, and sausage. I was also served a small dish of olives which they brine themselves...tasty. To drink I had a red birch beer...very tasty too. The pizza was $7 and a couple of bucks for the birch beer. Very reasonable for lunch in this area. 

I'll be back.;). Great experience! Loved the quail. Make sure to ask the sommeliers for wine recommendations! Spot on. Already planning our next visit!. We hired Graphic Web Design earlier this year when our website needed a makeover and we couldn't be happier.  Adem is always accessible by phone, text and email and has been extremely attentive to details and quick results. Very impressed with his ability to deal with a novice like me, without being condescending or intimidating. At the same time, he has always been more than happy to share his knowledge so that I can do some of the more mundane tasks myself. We have found his rates to be quite reasonable, and he never pads the bill with any "extras.". Wonderful establishment. I imagine seats are hard to come by on weekends, but during the week this place is very comfortable.. went to the lounge side the other night.  was kind of confused as to why they were charging $10 cover on a Monday night, especially when the place was far from packed, but then the door guy comped one of us, which made entry much more appealing.  the view is fabulous -- much better than Ghostbar at the Palms -- which softened the hit of weak $15 top shelf cocktails.. Nice restaurant located downtown, basically down a back street/alley.  The atmosphere was old school, with a large bar area and very secluded booths.  This created a bit of a problem, as we had 5 people and they stuck a chair at the end of our table, basically preventing the servers from getting to the table without effort.  The apps, salads and onion soup were excellent.  My adult son enjoyed the seafood cioppino, the wife liked the ravioli and the chicken parm was nice.  The Shrimp George was a bit dry and the "spicy" shrimp and scallop linguine was not spicy at all.  Service was very good.. we have been driving by this place for years but just stopped in for the first time.  Wow we really should have come sooner.  This place is great.  everything we ordered exceeded my expectations.  The menu is much bigger then I expected too.  Come here you will like it.. Awesome place to visit with so many high end shops and restaurants. It was a quite an experience this last time I went with the holidays being right around the corner. Lots of shopping and good eating to do here. This casino is also next to the Bellagio casino and a few others such as the Cosmopolitan, Paris and Planet Hollywood. Be prepared to do some spending with all the great stores around here.. Stumbled across this gem on my way to the Carolina Panthers game this weekend....Amazing Creps! 

Also, doesn't hurt being sat next to Michael Jordan while you are enjoying your breakfast!. Four stars from a guy...not bad, huh?

They had a pretty good selection and a lot of good deals on their inventory.

Their customer service was very good, and they were very helpful and down to earth...not something you see a lot of at higher end shops in Vegas.

The lady ended up with some good deals, and lucky for me, the store isn't big enough to spend the day at, because given the chance I know she would.. Best Burger on Earth.  Yep, it's a dive and yep, it's a dark dingy place. But I've never had an overcooked or under cooked burger.  They've always made my perfectly and the orders always come out quickly.  

Bring cash and walk away very full.. The original brisket is back. All is good again.  Thanks for listening to your customers.. I have been going here a few months and it is an amazing gym where you can not only get a great cardio workout but you will actually learn how to box. I enjoy the options of going to class or coming in and doing your own thing. The trainers who teach classes are great and all the employees are really nice and get to know you. Weather you are a beginner or someone who is in shape and knows how to box, this gym will cater to you and make you feel like a valued member.. Great food on a fantastic menu. Lola's is an off-strip/downtown gem for authentic New Orleans cuisine. The bronzed catfish is superb with the grits, and the crab cakes are well-portioned and delicious. Try the bananas foster for dessert.. I can't believe tacos this good are coming off of a food truck!

I was able to catch the taco truck a few times in front of Auto Palace Porsche. I have had their tacos several times and each time they are really fresh and full of flavor. I have tried the Angus Ground Beef taco with cheddar, jack cheese and salsa and the Grass Feed Steak taco with Kimichi. The Angus Ground Beef taco is by far my favorite so far. I always wash them down with a ice cold Mexican Coca Cola. 

I still need to try the Spicy Jerk Chicken, Chicken, Bacon and Cheddar and the Juicy Pork taco. For either $4 or $5 per taco is a defiant deal as all of the tacos are so delicious!

Service is always quick and with a smile too. If you're lucky enough to track them down I highly recommend giving their tasty and very unique tacos a try.

They also accept debit/ credit cards.. This club was pretty big and fun when my group went to Vegas. We had the right guy to girl ratio and getting in was easy.  The guys paid 30 bucks each and I think the girls paid 20 bucks each.  We didn't care as we were able to get our wristband and we had in/out privileges after that for the club. You have to dress to impress to look super sexy!  Make sure you don't make any cell phone calls outside of the club as the ushers in purple jackets tell you to move your butt down the hallway. You can't wait for your friends either outside as I guess it distracts from the club environment. 

When we first arrived at XS there weren't that many people on the dance floor or at the bar. The outside patio area was nice as it was pretty spacious. 

After coming back around 12:30PM (we went to the casino to hang out to gamble and drink), this place was packed. There was a separate line to go to once you had the wristbands (bypassed all of the other people in line). You couldn't move 3 feet without someone bumping into you and pushing you.  The music was bumping though as it was my kind of music. The dance/house music, top 40 hits and the remixes were awesome! The DJ that was spinning that night was spinning some PHAT jams.  The bar is busy so don't be that douche that keeps trying to flag down the bartender. You'll get your booze! You just have to be patient. 

The Go Go dancers were awesome! I think next time we go we're gonna roll deep with a bunch of people. 

Pregame, drink there and dance the night away. It's going to get hot so please make sure you wear some deodorant and cologne/perfume!. Madison has a lot of Lao/Viet/Thai places, but lets face it they mostly suck.  At least that's what I realized once I tried out Ha Long Bay.

They have an intimidatingly long menu that I have not begun to sample in my several trips but The Pad Thai and Sesame Chicken dishes I have had were both good if a little sweet.  The Vietnamese soup was pretty good.

The best part for me has been the appetizers.  Every cheap Chinese place has a crab rangoon or fried pot stickers on the menu but I have never had better rangoon-like fried items than at Ha Long Bay.  The Dumplings were also quite tasty though recently they have been more greasy and poorly formed than they were when the place opened.  The spring rolls were also excellent.

Also though it should not be a factor I have to give them props for replacing the 'Cajun' place that preceded it, that was one of the worst restaurants I have been to in Madison and the current occupants of the location do it much more honor.

btw, on one trip we were there a little late but our young waiter very obviously got baked in between bringing us courses.  It did not improve his waiting skills and our order immediately got messed up but it was hilarious so I suppose he get a pass.. Took my 16yr old daughter here to shoot for her 1st time. She did "The Little Giants" package. Our range guide was Doug and he was awesome!! After shooting all the .22 cal weapons Doug broke out the an M4 to finish. Battlefield Vegas was super professional and knowledgeable. You have a choice in Vegas.....choose Battlefield Vegas.. A friend of mine recommended this place and said it is run very well and boy, was he right. I think this is one of the best medical experiences I've ever had, which starts with the fact that as a patient, pretty much all the paperwork is digital, they actually give new patients a digital pad to use to fill in information. I just did my pre-physical tests and they actually give you a sheet, after an initial questionnaire, of the tests you need to take and as you go trough the process the items are checked off by the health providers to make sure they don't miss anything. When you are done with your physical another patient showed me you get a CD with the results from your physical examination. In addition, they work really hard to make sure people don't end up waiting, that you get into your appointments on time. 

I know, many service providers out there but this place strikes me as being above the norm relative to the quality of their operational practices and they definitely have my business for the foreseeable future.. I cannot believe this unfinished review on one of my favorite restaurants has been sitting there for exactly one year! Since I started the drat, we have been back there an additional 3 times. That says something about how much we enjoy Alize. 

So what makes a restaurant truly memorable? Is it simply saying, "that place was great"? Or is it posting a few pictures on Yelp and giving it 5 stars? Well yes. But for me, I found myself actually missing Alize and their tasting menu, and wanting to go back and experience it all over again. 

After my first visit in 2010, Alize became, and still remains one of my favorite restaurants. It's the first place we thought of when we made plans for a celebration in Vegas. The service is consistently top notch. The view of The Strip is unrivaled. And of course ... the food, absolutely amazing!

We ordered the Summer tasting menu in early September '14. A Fall / Winter tasting menu in January '15 and another tasting menu in May '15. Their consistency was unmatched. Each course came out at near perfect timing. Dirty dishes do not stay on our table long as there seems to be staff members lurking in the darkness, waiting for us to put our utensils down. I won't go over each course individually as their creative menu changes with the season, and could possibly be quite different when you go. But I can state with certainty the plating, the combination of flavors, the view and service makes the entire experience memorable. 

If I had to complain about something (let's face it, there's no 'perfect' place) is a course called Etorki. I recall it to be a dry cheese course that just didn't work well with my palette and the tasting menu. 

Also, unless they did a recent remodel, but the men's restroom looks like it belongs at a truck stop. It's small, dark and dingy with an old paper towel dispenser. It's very unlike the whole Alize experience. But I didn't go there to use the restroom. I return to indulge in the whole incredible dining experience provided by the incredible chef and team at Alize.  

Highly recommended! 

Notes: 

* Top of the Palms. Depending on what time of year you go, reserve a table when the sun sets. The Strip view is incredible as the sky changes color during sunset.
* If you ask nicely for a table facing the Strip during the reservation process, they might accommodate, because they are just awesome! 
* If you're driving to the Palms, remember which garage you parked at. Apparently there are 3 exits and after a few drinks, we forgot where we parked. 
* Weeknights tend to be a bit less crowded
* Excellent place for any type of special occasion.. My iPhone broke this Halloween weekend and I found MacMasters on Google!!  I called them and brought my iPhone 4G in and had it fixed in 5 minutes!!!  Very competitive price (59.99) and quick service.  They also have plenty of equipment for the iPhones, iPads and other MAC products (IE, MacBook Pro).

Very Professional, Quick Service and great prices all around!!!

Thanks MAC Masters!!!!. Went with friends and loved everything.  The grilled cheese was sooooo good.  Also loved my burger and fries.  Also all the desserts were right on the money.  I will go back soon and try some other menu items.  Love the simplicity of good food done awesome!!!!!. Yet again triple D doesn't disappoint. This place is great the atmosphere is contagious and the food was great. I will be back and I'm bringing friends. This place is amazing. One of the best Tapas restaurants I've ever been to. I highly recommend it.. Really excellent.  When you sit down, they bring chips and salsa, and the salsa is outstanding.  The chips are fresh, crispy and have that great Mexican-oil flavor.

I had and enchilada and a taco.  Both were very flavorful and authentic.  The refried beans were a bit bland, but they were a perfect temperature and consistency.

The crew there is extremely friendly and attentive (unlike Hertz). 

I highly recommend this place.. Best Mexican food in Madison. I got the Mexicana enchiladas and the breakfast burrito and they were delicious. Both tasted great heated up in microwave later. Food tasted fresh and the rice was not dry like you get at some places. Very pleasant staff and I will be returning many times in the future for the food that I had. Was extremely happy after eating here.. The fried chicken livers are so tender and good. The chicken is pretty good.
This place I need to visit more to try other things on the menu. The lemon cake was moist and tasty. I had inquired about it and when I got home there was a piece of lemon cake in my bag free of charge. The nice lady at the register was nice and friendly.. I am in love with Satay Brothers. They are the popular kids on the block. They are spicy yet cool! I love their satay, curry noodle soup with chicken, braised pork belly, and great beers. I'm not yet finished with my food but I already want seconds; damn the line is too long now! Don't miss Satay Brothers.. Loved the food here. Chilean seabass was to die for! This place was soo good I went back there the second night in LV! I ordered the NY steak and it was equally good. The steak is nicely sliced up for you, i.e. ez to eat. Loved the asian fusion sauce they drizzled over it with a bed of shitake mushrooms. Mmmhhmmm.
Wish there was a TAO here in SF... /sigh.. Gr8 sushi and teppan table cooking in a beautiful restaurant w/gracious servers.  Appetizers are delicious.  Kind of pricey but lots of coupons available for locals.  I like the rolls, tofu, filet, seaweed salad and vegetarian teppan.. My rating is more of 3.5 than a full 4 but oh well, its still good. Rehab Burger Therapy is maybe one of the worst names for a restaurant I've heard but still it didn't stop me from going in. Decor has no relation to name. Surfer looking joint. Which is fine. Menu doesn't relate to either concept, surfing or Rehab other than the sizing of the burger being "Rehab" for bigger and "Relapse" for the smaller.  Walked in on a February afternoon, restaurant is a bit on the warmer side, air's a little thick. Maybe just the day but still not perfect setting. Who cares about setting really, lets talk about the food. First of all the main reason I leaned to the 4 instead of 3 stars is mainly due to the waitress being pretty cute. That's a plus in my book. We started out with the calamari which was a great choice. Really good. They gave a really generous portion and we devoured it right away. Waitress brought us 3 different dipping sauces not sure if thats the norm, one was medium buffalo sauce that they put on the wings which she said "one of my favorites", 2nd was a chipotle something another, and the 3rd was the marinara that they give normally. All were fantastic! The buffalo sauce worked really well with the batter on the calamari and the other two were equally great. Like i said, we devoured it. Great start. We ordered beers, decent prices but not as chilled as they should've been. The three of us ordered all burgers, one had pulled pork on the burger but we were told they didn't have any pulled pork. Not good. We eventually ordered the bbq burger, chili cheese burger and the whatever the name was that had grilled pineapple, cheese and ham on this burger. BBQ burger went over really well. Pineapple ham burger also went over splendidly. My chili burger not quiet as good. The chili is good, would've been better as a side dish then on the burger. The whole plate when brought out was covered in chili. The bottom of my pretzel bun couldn't be found as it turned to mush from sitting in chili. Not good. The burgers are large but could use some kind of seasoning, a little on the bland side. Pretzel bun was ok, I've had better. You can buy better at Costco. Maybe they should do a daily run over there every day instead. The fries sucked. Barely ate any. The sweet potato tots were ok at best. Their sides need work for sure. Service even though she's pretty she was not the most prompt and kinda didn't show up for a while even though business was rather slow at this time. So there is some negatives but there was more positives so therefore a positive rating. I like the place but it does have room to improve. Hopefully if there is a next time, and it will be.. This is an absolute must stop if you are out and about in Charlotte.  The beer selection is expansive, the menu is diverse and tasty and the service is always quite good.  I will be back.. we got bottle service here.. they were incredibly busy as JayZ was performing at the Palms that night and it was spring break, march madness, etc etc.

got hooked up by Adam one of the managers there.. bypassed all the lines.. had a nice setup in the mezzanine area overlooking the dance floor.. great music and DJ that nite.. rocked it til 5am 

VIP access gave us access to all the other clubs in the Palms as well including Ghost Bar, Playboy Club,  and Rain

highly recommended for a nite out.. we had a mixed group of guys and girls (total 10 people) so for about $120 each for 2 bottles and line bypass this was a steal of a deal. We recently booked the neon boneyard for our wedding pictures, and could not have been more pleased. The signs make for dramatic backgrounds, giving you that vintage vegas vibe with a great mix of color, and decay from the signs. The attendant that accompanies you when you actually book a photo shoot was great, and fun, and not a bother at all. We booked an hour around sunset 5-6, and the lighting at that time was great. I'd like to go back sometime just to take the tour, and go in the evening. Overall we could not have asked for a better place to do our photographs for that once in a lifetime event!. Went to Camping World 2 days ago, had to pick up a few things for the rv. The customer service and pricing at Camping World is excellent. I would this place.. Ordered the mushroom sampler and it was wonderful. Bart our server was fantastic and told me which mushrooms to try.

My favorite was the spinach and shrimp.

The vodka and ginger drinks with mint were very refreshing.

Overall great place to dine.. Second time going proves the first was no fluke of excellence. This is my new goto spot. It seems like a family run, authentic, small space that purely cares about great food. I would take family, business, or a date to this quiet venue.. Beer was good and or appetizer was good, but I wouldn't call this a taproom.. I'm always trying to introduce my friends to this very unique establishment. Always getting positive feedback.

I liked this place already from the tacos and burritos that I would usually get. This time I opted for the bulgogi w/ lettuce wrap and the GHETTO STYLE RAMEN!!! I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT THESE TWO ITEMS!!! 

The bulgogi sitting on tortillas were really good when I first tried them. You can definately taste the successful fusion between these two great cultures. I was missing something though. I love the crunchy texture that you get from a lettuce wrap and daikon when eating bulgogi. The crunchy texture of the lettuce wrap, the sweet flavor of their bulgogi, and all the other makings burnt an everlasting impression into my taste buds. FOR SHEEZIE!!! I absolutely HEART this place now! :D

As for the GHETTO STYLE RAMEN?... What? Yallz want to go to that "other" spot for some ramen? I'm going to KoMex for some AWESOME GHETTO STYLE RAMEN!!! The weather is getting chilly to an uncomfortable cold now. This is perfect for this weather. I'm not even going to tell you what's in it. GHETTO STYLE RAMEN ALL DAY SUN!!! 

Thanks KoMex

EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!. I love this place. A friend nearby invited and it's cozy.  Decorative, relaxed, piano playing and great tea all in one.. In Vegas for a work conference and my colleague and I decided to go shoot some rounds through a few different pistols.  My usual range experience at other locations is pretty bland...show up, get targets, get ammo, go in, shoot, pay leave.

Whether we were lucky or the stars aligned we had the BEST experience here.  James spent quite a bit of time checking our skill levels and teaching us some new skills.  You could tell he was passionate and wanted you to be safe yet have fun.  Steve came in later to give James a break and again showed the passion and interest in helping out that I wish every range had for their customers.  I came out of there with more skills to practice and more learning than expected.  Again not sure this is the norm, but I hope so.   Definitely recommend the place.  Nice little lounge to relax in, employees were all really nice and helpful.  Just need them to move to my hometown.  My passion to shoot my arms has been renewed thanks to Green Valley Range!. Such a great hotel. Has everything you need to keep you on the property: outstanding food and drink options, large/clean/newer hotel rooms with great views of the Bellagio Fountains and strip, multiple swimming pools, etc. The rooms and property as a whole are full of unique pieces of artwork and show attention to detail. At this point, I cant imagine staying somewhere else.

Even the most basic rooms are good size...larger than your typical hotel rooms. We were offered an upgrade (Marriott Gold), but it would have been to a one bedroom suite without a Fountain View, so we declined in favor of watching the fountains from our balcony.

My only complaint was that table minimums here were consistently higher than all other places on the strip. Even when I went down to the casino at 6 am, the single craps table that was open was a $25 minimum and nobody was playing. I was fully ready to play some $15 tables, but nothing was available...craps, blackjack, or otherwise, and the casino was very slow at that point. I ended up doing most of my gambling at other casinos. I'm a $10 - $15 table guy.

We were also there during one of the spring break weeks, and this is definitely the place that the college kids hang out at.

A few tips about being a Marriott Rewards member, because I had no idea: as mentioned above, I asked at check in if we could be upgraded as a Marriott Gold member, and they obliged, but we declined the room type. Also, there is a VIP lounge just to the left of the back entrance that we could have used to check in, rather than standing in the regular line. Unfortunately, we didn't find out about this until we waited about 15 minutes in the lobby to check in. Lastly, you can convert your Identity Rewards points to Marriott points after your stay. I haven't done this yet, but you can do it through the Marriott Rewards website.

We cant wait until our next trip back to the Cosmopolitan!. SO. #%$&ing. GOOD. 
AUTHENTIC, Real. Genuine, in an artificial city full of hoodwinking fakes. Delicious and homemade, unlike all of their competition. Am I connected to them? No, I'm connected to the TRUTH: do yourself a favor and eat this pizza before you die and waste your life.. Their food is very tasty. I ate there twice in one week. Had fried oyster for lunch and Ahi Tuna for dinner.  The Ahi Tuna could be seared with higher heat for texture and color, however the seasoning brought it over the top.. Small store, friendly service, fast delivery and very reasonable price with decent quality. Good lunch choice for show booth staff.. Awesome atmosphere and food. Always a big crowd which is testament to its greatness. I had a mocha and 2 eggs/bacon/hash. Nice place to study, work or just hang out.. I actually ate here a couple of years ago with a colleage, was back in Charlotte and PLANNED PLANNED PLANNED to come back but, my plans were spoiled  :(

The food and service were terrific the first time we ate here.  Basil came highly recommended by our hotel concierge and it was an excellent recommendation.  The food was fresh, very nicely prepared, and spiced well.

I will be back in Charlotte in a couple of weeks - if my plans get spoiled then, SOMEONE is going to pay!!!. This place is AWESOME. I am so happy there is finally a place for us old timer nostalgic-for-the-80s-and-90s folks like me to go hang out, play videogames of literally every possible kind, a generous helping of arcade machines, home consoles, and game-themed local beers to enjoy while I play!

Bars don't really appeal to me, and this place took the bar concept and made it COOL. Hell, even if videogames aren't your thing, there's a nice big pile of board games and card games available to entertain even the toughest customer.

It's clear these guys had a vision of what kind of clientele they wanted to serve. And I am happy with their vision! Come play some Cards Against Humanity with me and my friends sometime! We're making this a bi-weekly thing for sure!

Oh, and we had fun filming here, too.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4nHlm1R6qQ&feature=share. Delicious. Devine. Delectable.  And coffee in little french presses!  Yay.  Get one of everything.. Brawley's is one of my favorite bottle shops in Charlotte and is the probably the OG in the game. There are multiple taps a video screen with their draft list.  Their bottle selection is pretty damn good and varies from the others in the area.  Everything is sectioned pretty nice and the prices are some of the best in the area.  Also, they do get specialty kegs that they like to hide which is always a pleasant suprise.  The only thing i would change in this place is moving to proper glassware instead of plastic cups.  Though i understand why they do it and its not that big of a inconvenience.. Here's the deal:

The other reviews that talk about the chicken being pretty much "Ok" are on target.  It isn't 'bad' chicken, it's pretty good....it just doesn't "wow" you like you'd think it would at a place that pretty much just does this ONE thing.  Chick Filet chicken strips are superior in my opinion, as are Popeyes.  The reason?  Flavor and seasoning.  The strips at Canes are just 'there'.  Not really a lot of flavor.

So why 5 stars you ask?  Three reasons:

1.  The Toast and sauce are amazing.  Like, I mean, another planet-type amazing.  The fries and cole slaw are pretty good, tasty but about average, like the chicken.  But the Texas Toast is the perfect texture, a golden brown toasted buttery slice of body-convulsing heaven.  The Canes Sauce and honey mustard are also both awesome.  So, so good.

2.  The cleanliness of the place.  It's clear that Cane's places a high priority on cleanliness and things looking fresh and clean.  the color scheme is also nice, the entire layout is simple yet fresh and modern.  You actually feel good and calm while you're in there.  It's hard to explain.  Just walk into one and you'll see what I mean.

3.  I saved the best for last.  The CUSTOMER SERVICE is out of this world.  I've been at different times, through drive thru, walk in, and every person has been the same:  bright, friendly, energetic, and seemed genuinely happy to see me and serve me.  Think about it:  we all have bad days.  Days when we're worrying about personal stuff, finances, days when we're sick or don't feel good.  Even in the service industry.  People are people.  We're all human.

But everyone here, down to the cooks and people cleaning the lobby, are fantastic and make you feel like a super star.  This can only mean two things:  a.)  customer service is heavily emphasized by management here, and, more importantly  b.)  these people actually enjoy their job and being there.  That is rare and a great thing.

Final Analysis:  The chicken is 'meh'.  Not bad, decent enough.  Maybe a smidgen above average.  The reason you go here is for the bread, sauces, and the way you are treated and feel.. Wow I am so impressed at this restaurant. The manger and owner Cathy is courteous and kind. The food is fantastic and in a good big size. One of the few restaurants in Vegas that I can recommend to any one.!. This is a above average Arby's.  The service was great  and the food was fresh and delicious.  Try the mozzarella sticks here. Very good for fast food.. Had a late dinner on 12/3 (10pm).  We were greeted and seated right away.  The restaurant is tucked away, but had a great view of the Bellagio fountain show.  Service was great.  Their wine is is fair.  They had a couple of choices for 1/2 bottle pinot noir at a decent price.
Oysters- The kumamotos (sp?) were pretty good.  They came with a vinaigrette added already
Creamy Polenta- Very good.  
Short ribs Agnolotti- The best dish of the night.  Loved the hint of horseradish amid the butter sauce
Spagetti-  A tad on the bland side.  But liked the home made pasta.
Creme Brûlée-    Not your typical creme brulee.  This was a deconstructed version and was "interesting".  Probably wouldn't get it again.  

All in all, a good meal.. Joe makes the best friggin burgers hands down!

The rest of the menu is very inventive and plenty of options that are non burger related. Brian the head waiter is awesome and a pleasure to see . The beer is always ice cold and the shakes are delicious!

$5 burger mondays are insane!. UMIYA is the best place for a low key lunch or dinner after a long day on the strip everything I ordered, myself and  the wifey had over 9 dishes each better than the next. I recommend the screaming o salad and the dumplings a must for every visit to Las Vegas. Quick and simple Chinese food. Lunch combos include egg drop soup or salad, fried rice, egg roll and fried wonton for about about 10 bucks. My favorites are the Kung Pao Chicken, General Chu's Chicken, and I've heard great things about the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce. Get it with brown rice to save a few calories. I stay away from oriental dishes containing beef unless I know they're using high quality steak. That goes for any restaurant. 

I believe they're family-owned and operated. The staff is always very nice and will chat with us if we have enough time. We're usually in a rush, so they expedite our lunches and we're in and out the door in less than 30 minutes. The prices may be on the high side, but you don't have many alternatives in the area aside from Pei Wei, and you'll pay the same there.

Great for take-out too!. Finally found a decent salad bar in Chandler.  Great selection of salad items and its fresh.  My only criticism is the yelling to each other, especially the one with the belligerent voice. 
But, ill cone back with headphone next time !!!!. I would start off by saying that RAKU deserves my first yelp review!!! Everything here was simply delicious and service was outstanding as well. Although there was a wait on the food, it was understood that they were packed full house. The server had told me that I was lucky to even to get a seat in the restaurant and that they were booked until close, but let me tell you that the wait was well worth it. Every dish I tried had a good combination of flavors and was cooked to perfection. They had a Chilean sea bass on special that was grilled and coated with their home made teriyaki sauce with a side of daikon, hamachi Kama (my fav), all the skewers i tried were delicious, green tea brûlée w green tea ice cream!? So awesome!!! I would go on but I think it's better if you make the reservation yourself and try it!!!. Cha Da Thai is incredible!!! Not only is the food exquisite, but the staff there is generous, accommodating and genuinely cares about your dining experience. The manager Kevin even let us try on a Cha Da (Thai crown.) The Tom Kha is some of the best I have had in the valley and I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the mood for Thai!. DLUX has great burgers and even better fries. I've been here a number of times and I have never had a bad time or meal. The same goes for the drinks - their specialty cocktails are always mixed perfectly.. Love the Hut. Most sub shops have one token veggie sub, but not the Hut. They've got at least 7 different options for non-meat eaters, and they are all original and incredibly delicious. Best veggie subs: Humbolt, Griefo, Silver Haze, and my personal favorite, the Magic Mushroom: portabella mushrooms marinated in teriyaki sauce, topped with green peppers, pineapple & pepper jack cheese... Yum!

Yeah, it's got the whole doobie-licious theme going, and yeah, it's pretty hilarious, but it's the sandwiches that keep me coming back. And the rice krispie treats. Oh, and the hemp brownies. Can't forget about the brownies.

Service can be a little slow when they're busy, but it's so worth the wait.. Love this place! Beer is cold food is decent! Big Daddy is one of the nicest guys you will meet at the bar. He always says hi to everyone and wants them to have a good time. Bartenders are always friendly. Great little neighborhood bar!. I've only had drinks here so far, but the food I saw looked amazing. I'm a fan of the atmosphere too; the music kept the feeling upbeat and the bartenders were all really nice particularly Chris (think that was his name).

It's a little pricey, but no more than you would expect given the location.. Was there once with another couple who ranted and raved about the place. They even knew the owner so I was suspicious but game to try a new sushi place. Thanks Galena and Sebastiaan!!

I got hooked on sushi back in 1981 so I know what I like. This place was amazing. We had about 9 separate chef's choice order. One was the screaming orgasm. It was literally 10 stars out of 10 if I could go that high. It was fusion sushi with a flare and it was worth every morsel. We literally soaked up the sauce with the last bit of rice. And that was the first dish and each dish after were just as good. 

Will definitely go back more often, except it is about 30 miles from where we live.

Update: November 2009.  Went back again with relatives and again the restaurant did not disappoint. Still one of the best places for sushi. This time I did not even look at the menu and just asked for chef special.. Good yogurt and resonably priced.  Give it a try.. Here's the short story on Marquee Theater. 

Parking & Arrival: 
Easy waling distance from Mill Ave where there are 100 college bars and there is some parking on the street/garages for cheap. Tons of hot coeds, cheap food, etc. Go early, hit happy hour at a nearby bar and enjoy the walk across the bridge. It crosses a man-made lake which is pretty cool in the middle of the desert. If the bridge is too much exercise for you then you are going to the wrong venue because you will be standing for the next 3 hours as there are no inside seats, only picnic tables on the patio full of smokers. Yes, there is parking right behind the venue (under the bridge) but it fills up fast. I see people bitching about $5 parking. Have you been to the football or baseball stadium or cricket pavilion in the past ummmmm decade? If so you know they charge as much as $25 to park a mile away. Quit bitching. 

Security: 
Yeah they are hardcore and annoying. Put your "stash" in your underwear like you've been to a concert before. If you put it in your purse or front pocket they will take it. Duh. 

Bar: 
I don't think the prices are too bad. Yeah, they are gonna kill you on Jager redbull bombers (just like everywhere else - again duh) but they have Sierra Nevada and some good local 4 Peaks on tap and I think big ass 24 drafts were like 6-7$ which isn't too bad. That same beer costs $10 at AZ Diamondback games and is even more expensive at the football stadium so no big deal. If you think that's too expensive its probably cuz you do most of your drinking at home or at the Applebees happy hour in Casa Grande or AJ. The bar also takes credit cards and they even run you a tab (at least on slower nights). Whoever was complaining about the necessity to bring cash and to empty pockets of change I'm not sure what you are talking about. Why do you have spare change anyway? If you think you are buying a beer with spare change anywhere within 15 miles of a concert venue you are smoking crack and don't need the beer. Grow up. 

Sound Quality: 
Its an old music venue that had the carpet and seats and wall trimmings ripped out years ago leaving a cement oval building. It sounds like a cement oval building. Period. 

Stage: 
Everything that sucks about this venue is also whats great about it! They get shows nobody else wants. Period. The nicer venues are either too big for the bands or they know the punk rock / death metal kids don't buy anything so they wont book those bands cuz they don't make enough at the concession stands. Its just business. The good news is you can get closer to the stage here than anywhere else in town. A $30 ticket here would cost you $150 somewhere else to be this close. Its all general admission and the crowd is usually not so dense so you can get up front for a few songs, get out (without the bouncers plucking you from the crowd) and go to the bathroom, grab a beer, and still get right back up front within a song or 2. Everyone gets a chance to have their turn up front! 

Seating: 
I saw someone posted that there is outdoor seating. Just to clarify there are picnic tables on the patio which is where everyone goes to smoke (no smoking inside anywhere in AZ). You CANNOT see the stage from here. And the tables fill up fast before the show and during intermission so don't count on getting one. 

Note to annoying people who go to shows early, never go to the bathroom, never leave to go to the bar, don't smoke, etc. You get there early with your girlfriend and you get right up front. Shes all smiles as she holds onto the rail front and center. Guess what? I'm coming up front for my turn mofo. Deal with it. Don't get mad, you didn't pay extra for front row and you don't own it. Its called general admission and there is going to be pushing and shoving. Nothing mean, nothing rough, but there will be the constant swell and pressure from the crowd on your back all night. Goes with the territory. There is plenty of space where you can cuddle and hold hands, its just not where you happen to be nesting. I will get my turn front and center, and I will relinquish it after a few songs so some teenager can have it and so on and so forth. We know you are excited to be in the best seat in the house. You have probably never seen a show from that close because you are either too cheap to buy the good seats or too much of a pansy to actually make it up there thru a mosh pit. Enjoy it during the opening act, but just fade out and avoid having your night ruined and your girlfriend pick a fight that you have to (gulp) finish. There is usually no stage show / effect per se so there's not that much to see up there that you cannot also see from the back row which is only 50 feet away anyway. 

Leaving: 
Be careful. Lots of cops. AZ has some of the worst/strictest DUI laws in the country so if you are not from around here you have been warned!. I came here for lunch and had from their prix fixe menu the society chopped salad, chicken club and donuts. The staff was very attentive and since I don't like cinnamon, they offered to substitute for regular doughnuts.

The dishes were very fresh and although the choices weren't crazy, Society Cafe Encore provided simple food executed very well.

I would definitely recommend this place for lunch in Vegas.. Tried MM on a Monday afternoon with the missus. We arrived at 3:30 and there were 20 guests inside and three servers. Good ratio. 

My wife ordered wine and a GF pizza with two ingredients. I got an iced tea and a small mighty meat pizza. Check came to $42.36 plus tip. A lot for two 10" pies, wine and tea. 

It arrived in 14 mins, piping hot as usual. Our server, JoAnna, was a bit slow with the service but when we asked for anything, she delivered. Rather undecided about her. 

The GF pizza was disappointing. We've had a lot of GF pizzas, so we know good from bad. There was almost no sauce on it. In fact, my wife said she didn't want the leftovers until I told her I could make some marinara at home. My pie was very good tho. It had plenty of toppings, sauce and cheese.. Saw this place on triple D and my wife and I decided to try it. As Guy would say "this place is out of bounds!" So bomb! We got the Sonora and the William tell from the episode and I'm glad we did. Great flavor and texture plus everything is scratch made. Awesome staff. My wife and I were in Vegas celebrating our vow renewal and they gave use a free soup. Which was tasty btw! Get the mimosa sampler you won't regret it.. History, atmosphere,lush  vegetation, savoury smells, great wine list, best tomatoes, clearly sophisticated but not pretentious, and hospitable service...What other tricks have they got to pull to get you to eat here?  If there were a way to splice me in half so that my other me could enjoy the rest of the menu that I did not eat...I would gladly do this.  The nearby mosque beckoned praises as the chimes filled the air and emphasized the near spiritual experience eating at Tricks unveiled.. Ordered the large  pesto with pepperoni and onions.  Very well may have been the best pizza i have ever eaten.  Was busy in there but pizza only took like 8 mins to get served. Big wine selection altho the carafe was barely enough for two.. Jason gave us a great deal on the new floors and was able to get the job done right away   They moved the furniture and had everything installed within two days.

A job well done

Thanks. Almost too cheap to be true fruits and veggies at this place. I'm not sure if we just caught it on a good night but after reading the other reviews it doesn't look like it. 

It struck me as slightly disheveled and took me a little while to find things, but I think that was just a product of me being a first time customer. 

It's like a much less corporate TJ's or Whole Foods, and way cheaper.. had my springs replaced in 20 minutes...called around for different quotes and no could beat his prices!!!
Would recommend to anyone to call Dreikson first.. Same day service how can you beat that!
5 stars for this place 
thanks again... This updated 5 star rating is for the security who assisted me in carrying my heavy TV when I didn't even ask for assistance. He simply just saw me trying to manage a heavy TV and offered to help. This immediately made me refer back to this review that I unfairly criticized collectively of the security staff.. Massage Envy is the best way to get into a regular monthly schedule of therapeutic massage in a soothing spa like environment for a reasonable cost. The fact that you can use your prepaid massages at any of their hundreds of locations all over the USA is what makes this program so good for frequent travelers like me. I have never had a bad massage at a Massage Envy despite using over ten of their locations and more than double that many massage therapists. I also recommend bringing a special friend and treating him or her to a massage on you... It is a great conversation topic afterwards and an excellent prep step to going out on the town.. So I heard about this place from a friend and decided to check it out. At first I was skeptical because I didn't think I would get a nice fade from a salon and I was about to go to a barbershop. But for 11.99 I figured why not let's try it out and see what happens. The wait time was long but my fade turned out awesome. It was worth the wait for sure. This is going to be my new regular spot. Location is super convenient too!

I went at 6pm and they were slammed. I was actually the last customer but the lady still cut my hair perfectly she didn't rush or anything even faded in my beard because I told her I wanted to keep it.. Went back and ordered same thing and order was fine. Portions good and reflected price as appropriate. I hope the kitchen crew didn't get an ass-chew due to my review, but the output was week, reference my earlier review

Owner was gracious in his reply to me and offered me free dinner; but i don't take freebies like 47% of the country, so while gesture was nice, I work and prefer to pay for things i order. Sorry, Republican here = no handouts.

Most likely won't come back as there are other options N and NW side, but I do appreciate the owner's positive response.. Get a free margarita when you check-in on Yelp! Generous portions of delicious Mexican dishes :). I came in on a busy day and their schedule was full but they managed to squeeze me in before the day's end. My Mini Cooper needed the muffler removed and an exciting new look for the exhaust. This is the only shop that had the burnt tips in stock and ready to be installed. Overall I am happy with how my car now sounds and looks. Couldn't have asked for a better outcome!. Went back this morning with the family and just had to say how good it was.  My wife got the Vegan burrito even as a meat lover I must say, it was really good.  I had the Huevos Ranchero and the kids of course got the Brizza's.   

The egg whisperer was at it again.  The basted eggs are the Best I've eaten. 

Of course even having stuffed myself with the whole families left-overs I can't leave scramble without eating their french toast.  It is my favorite french toast anywhere.  When I'm in Scottsdale I have to eat it.   My wife feels the same about the sweet potato hash.   

The kids were as happy as - well- as happy as kids eating pizza!  

Oh and almost forgot but we brought our dog too - and guess what?  They cater to people with dogs.  Dog bowls and everything.  Awesome.  

Service as usual was very hop-to-it helpful, happy, smiling, fast and pleasant to the eye. 

Scramble is perfect for morning to lunch business and family outings with the dog - What more do you want?  

Again it's my number one breakfast recommendation in AZ period.. You don't get better barbecue then this!! WOW! Everything they serve here is done with attention to detail and you can definitely taste the love!  Family ran business!  If you want phenomenal central Texas style barbecue, you need to come here!  Worth the trip wherever you are in Phoenix.  

Don't bother going to other spots in Phoenix for BBQ. I've been to them and they just don't stand up to the quality and prices this place delivers!. Has been a looong time since I went to Oyshi, as my first experience here was less than memorable, and pre-Yelp.  

Some colleagues talked me into another visit recently, and I have to say, I was pleased with the AYCE lunch special.  I found a couple rolls that were interesting and spicy.  Enjoyed them both thoroughly.  My colleagues raved about their selections also.  The sushi chefs were very courteous, and the waitress was quick to assist with questions and recommendations.  

I will definitely keep this on my lunch list, and may have to make an evening visit, when you really decide on that last star at a local sushi spot!  "Kanpai!". One of the best Steak's I've ever had.

We made reservations 1 month in advance and we overheard someone at the door sounding frustrated that they waited 1 hour for a table.

We walked right in.

The place is expensive, but the food WAS REALLY GOOD.

For a super super super fancy dinner, I would come here again.. Very enjoyable evening.  Fantastic service by the wait staff and entertaining performance by the chef.  Would recomend for a good change of pace from the norm.. Discount Tire for me is the best place to buy tires for all of my cars. Have been a loyal customer for many years. Great service great prices and large selection of tires. They will also price match anybody plus they do free repairs on flats.. Switched hotels during my Vegas trip because of a work conference that I was attending. I have stayed at the Venetian a couple of times on previous vacations/trips and its pretty much the same experience. The rooms are identical compared to the Venetian, but I think I much prefer the Venetian over the Palazzo because the vibe is very different even though the hotels are managed by the Sands and are also obviously connected to each other. What is so different? I think it is the people  that stay at each of the hotels and nightlife/things-to-do... the Palazzo typically tends to be older and more mellow and the Venetian tends to be much younger and higher energy. The nightlife, clubs, and restaurants reflect that sentiment as well. Not a bad place at all to stay in Vegas... just prefer the Venetian which is reflected in the rating. 4.5 stars rounded down to 4.. Great food and service, but the orange juice, which everyone raves about, was sour on the day I had it.  Went with the blueberry smoothie instead.  Good stuff!. Always reliable and never loses any of my clothes!  They do a sharp job!. For some reason people are giving this place hard knocks.  I went there and absolutely loved it.  On the weekends there is an awesome gourmet menu with stuff like crab legs, venison, duck, steak, ect.  You name it they have it.  And who couldn't love the bottomless white and red wine???  Plus, every table gets a lobster tail.  I think that alone would make this a great buffet.  Anyway, I always come empty and leave full and a little too tipsy.

I have also been to the brunch buffet.  Not quite as good, but still pretty great with bottomless chamagne and a huge selection.. Fantastic pizza. They sell their own dough, so that's a plus! 
Great NY feel and service is always great with plenty of seating along the aisle, back and outside.  Love the samples near the register as well.. This is a very good restaurant, but I don't think it is as good as the original. Our first visit the manager was rude to us and it was very apparent that this wasn't the original. The nephew of the owner was bussing tables saw that we were upset and put us in touch  with his uncle that evening. 

The owner offered to purchase us a meal on out next visit and promised to fix the issues. I never did take the owner up on the offer of a free dinner but we have been back to this location a few times and the restaurant has totally changed. I haven't seen the not so great of waitress nor the rude manager but have been very happy with every thing they have done. It just isn't the original though.. I have seen Dr. Sherma a few times and he and his staff have always been great.   He takes the time to answer questions and explain issues. I would highly recommend his practice to anyone.. Got here around 8pm on Wednesday after a pretty hard workout and I was dying for a good sized pasta and I was not disappointed! I ordered Tagialelle with carbonara pecorino cheese, spinach,  mushroom, roasted garlic and chicken and everything was on point! I'll be back often so stand by for more pasta photos and reviews.. Food is good, atmosphere is nice, a little grotto in town. And great for kids who like to watch and feed the ducks and turtles in the pond while you wait for table and food. I spent about 2 months searching for the perfect bike. I finally found the bikes I want. 

I went over to other places and they didn't have the Giant brand that I was looking for. 

These guys carried it, and it was on sale! Unfortunately they didn't have it at this store, but they said they will ship it from their other store which took only 2 days. I came in on the 2nd day and there it was, reserved for me. 

The people there were extremely helpful. Also they tuned and set the bike up for me. Which many places will just give you bike without setup. 

As I was buying the bike the guy also said that they also do free tune ups for life. This surprised me as usually other bike places cost or sell plans for this. Added benefit booyah!

In conclusion I highly recommend these guys for purchasing and tuning of bikes. They live and breathe bikes!. They make possibly the best burger on the planet....nuff said!. The kids always have fun when we attend a party here. We have had parties hosted here in the past ( the old location) and the staff was pretty good with the kids. 

Ill start with the cons: this location is kinda weird to access. If your coming in the late afternoon the sun can easily blind you from seeing the turn in right off of the freeway. If you miss it you have to turn around and drive back :( that's not cool at all. The the building is just placed in a weird spot. Now to end on a positive note.

PROS: Its a giant warehouse with inflatable slides and jump houses. Tones of fun for kids and adults alike. The employees are nice and treat the kids accordingly.. Made reservations via YELP Open Table. Been wanting to come here for a couple of years now. Glad we did!

Kevin and Olga were our servers and they were AWESOME! Kevin explained the menu and made helpful suggestions. Gave us some time to look over menu then came back to see if we had any questions and yes we did and he went over it again with us. 

We took his suggestion and ordered like a tasting menu. My gf and I each ordered our entree's, she had the t-bone and I chose the 24 hr braised short rib. Then three salads, Italian buffalo mozzarella, Caeser's salad then we were stuck and Kevin suggested the warm frisee salad w/ bacon. Then our sides were mashed potatoes, fries and then we were stuck again and Keven suggested brussel sprouts w/bacon. Oh yeah our dinners also came with lobster bisque to start and a pan of bread!

Everything we ordered was delicious! Kevin's suggestions were right on! 24 hour braised beef was tasty and soo tender! 

I wondered why they didn't ask us what we wanted for dessert, then they brought 4 different plates and it was all for us!! Fresh mixed fruits, a scoop of ice cream and a scoop of sorbet, sticky bun w/ a scoop of coffee ice cream and a strip of lemon and a strip of pineapple cake or bread with some kind of cream topping. Everything again was soo good!

Again I can't stress enough about the service! Kevin you are the BEST! You and Olga make a great team! We will be back on our next trip!. Absolutely loved this place when I went there while I was on a business trip. Since then I have bought a second home in Las Vegas and plan on frequenting this place whenever I have a chance.. Found this fantastic wine room while doing a search online and in Yelp.  Great ambiance, great wine selection and love the decor.  Just had a glass of the menu Cab but it was delicious.  Looking forward to being back and using the self-serve wine selection.. Brian Susan and their crew doing awesome job wish I would've found them sooner . They show up every week never miss a day and always communicate when I need something. Herb Sausage gravy and biscuits are out of this world.  Was anxious to try them because most places over do the herbs.  The atmosphere on a Thursday morning was very welcoming and enjoyable.  It's likely a zoo on weekends, but once you try you can see why.  Lastly, if you can, ask for Jody.  She was tremendous.. i had the "LOW COUNTRY SHRIMP AND GRITS"
(creamy anson mills grits - sweet peppers
spinach - artisan andouille - tasso gravy)
and it was delicious.
and as part of the restaurant week with a $30 three-course meal it was a deal too.. Nice little upscale place in Scottsdale. We split the mac and cheese, which was awesome, and we both had the espresso rubbed filet. The service was exceptional. I ordered a glass of Shiraz that didn't agree with me. Our server promptly swapped it out for a zin that was very good. I definitely recommend the place!. This review is based on several visits without using any coupon or any discount vouchers (A source of discontent by many yelplers).

A very good, contemporary steakhouse worthy of the Vegas Strip.  Comfortable for a guys steak nite; refined with healthy, pretty menu selections for the ladies.

The beef tartare is an excellent starter.  The earthiness of the truffle aioli provides a surprisingly different take on the classic.  The foie gras with candied apricots and vanilla gastrique is also a must try.  Vanilla with foie sounds disgusting but it really works, enhancing the full fat flavor of the foie.

Steaks are good but not great.  The restaurant does not make any grading claims on their menu, nor do the serves openly comment on the grade. They are well trimmed and perfectly cooked.  The bone in ribeye and the Kansas city strip are very flavorful but are oddly one dimensional when compared to steaks from the "elite steakhouses".  Good beef flavor but missing the "umame" profile of good aging.

The veal chop deserves special mention (don't hate me).  It is surprisingly flavorful tasting more like free range pork than bland veal.

Sides are simple and meant to be shared.  The simple wild mushrooms are a perfect match to any steak.

The wine list is well chosen but not as extensive as other steakhouses.  Prices are in line with Vegas standards.

Service is excellent.. Great, small, family owned and operated restaurant.  Some days I just don't want to go to a full sit-down restaurant but also don't want to settle for fast-food.  This place fills that void.  They offer typical grilled teppanyaki food cooked to order that you can eat there or take home.  Some of the combo plates can be a bit pricey, but the portions are large.  I went there on a Friday evening and the husband was in the back cooking, the wife taking orders at the counter, and their little daughter was giving high-fives to customers like myself.  I was provided with a sample and conversation while I waited for my food to be ready.  Very friendly folks and great food to-go.. I dragged my friends to the Bellagio buffet because it was rated one of the best buffets in vegas.  After a torturous 45 min wait, we finally got a table.  The selection was all right.  We went to the Bally's buffet earlier in the week because some locals claimed it was the best bang for the buck.  So I was looking forward to a higher end buffet.  

The selection was much better than Bally's.  My favorites were the kobe beef, lamb, crab legs, and the Chinese lo mein.  My friends claimed the kobe beef was on the salty side but it was pretty good by my standards.  Nothing really blew me away.  The sushi selection was disappointing.  I liked how they cracked open the king crab legs.  Less work.  I thought the dessert selection was pretty nice.  The chocolate chip on top of my cheesecake had Bellagio written on it.  Amused me for a second.  

The Bellagio buffet was all right.  I was debating whether it deserves 3 stars or 4.  If I could I would give it a 3.5, but I'll be nice and round up to 4.  Next time I will try the Wynn.. On the advice of Yelp we went here.

It did not disappoint, everything was excellent.

All three of us had something different. 

The chili verde, it was amazing, nice tinder and with just the right amount of heat! The portions were sizable!

Tamales, wow, hand made greatness. I can't say anything bad about these other than the fact the spicy sauce wasn't ordered with them.

The carne asada torta was also great! Nice tender beef, nice amount of avocado good bread and quite nice.. Been coming here for years, and for good reason.  The food here is always great.  The people here treat you like family.  My wife and I had the usual chicken dinner.  This was also the first time we brought e girls, who are 5 and 3.  The kids loved chef Eddie, and he really got on their good side bringing them out some mochi.  Great time and great for bringing the kids.  Love this place!. The Hofbrauhaus is a must stop for anyone visiting Pittsburgh. This German beer hall serves beer by the liter at a reasonable price.

The live entertainment in the beer hall makes any evening here fun with friends.

In my several visits here, I have sampled many items on the menu and haven't been disappointed yet!. Extremely happy The Bazaar has come to Las Vegas. I've missed the cotton candy fois gras dearly, and probably had a year's worth in one meal to make up for it. A few things are different, and there's an overwhelming amount of meat choices, which is wonderful. Not a big fan of the nori meat tacos, I think the anago cucumber ones in LA are better. Also, the Philly cheesesteaks are missing too, which was a bummer. But, the wagyu beef was on point, the wine list is solid, the patisserie tasty, and everything else was great. Glad the Magic Mojito made the cut too!. Cute hole in the wall place. 

Have the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon. That's what I had, and I will be going back. 

I also had a blueberry-coconut muffin. It was fresh that morning. Get it warmed up with butter. 

So everything bread here is homemade and made from scratch. That is just so hard to find. 

By the way they are Buckeye fans!. A virtual alcoholic mecca. For me anyway. 

What a fabulous, beautiful, STOCKED liquor store. I walk in and stare in wonder. Wine as far as the eye can see, shelves of every kind of beer imaginable, nice, helpful people. I asked if I could live here, but they told me no. Buzz kill (ha!). 

Lee's compared is old, dusty, poorly stocked, dingy and I will never grace the door of that place ever again. I have found my new love and its name is Total Wine. 

My favorite part about this place is that they have beer in all sizes and there's so much of it, it's practically overflowing. I can get Chimay in the big bottle, or the little ones. Same with Delirium Tremens. They have beers from all over the place, Belgium, Hawaii, everywhere! I'm a beer lover and they know it!

I used to buy all sorts of wine here, too (well, in Virginia, actually), until I fell in deep love with beer. You can trust this place to have any kind of wine you're looking for. You can shop and just pick one up and you're pretty guaranteed to find something you really will love and keep coming back for. 

Staff is nice and helpful, the store is immaculate and there is so much alcohol. Did I mention that? 

They also have gourmet snacks, glassware, pretty much anything you need to drink. I didn't buy liquor here, but you can bet I'll be back for that!

Favorite liquor store, EVER.. Clean and safe park elevated in foothills of Vegas so a bit cooler as well. Nice at night to occupy the kids. Had an excellent time! My girlfriend and my first time on Valentine's Day and it was perfect. Carole is fun and very friendly! Made us feel comfortable at something we have never been a part of. Will definitely be doing more of these. Very hospitable environment and brought drinks and just enjoyed the two hours. Instruction was just enough. Thanks!!! We will see you again soon!. I finally made it to Comme Ca for lunch!  Now what's so special about their lunch you ask?  For me, one specific dish has intrigued me for a long time just because of how bizarre it sounds....their Duck Confit Cinnamon Bun.

I've waited a looooooong time to try their Duck Confit Cinnamon Bun.  Mainly because I guess it's a seasonal dish and it's been on and off the menu.  Last time I was Vegas, it was off the menu and I was devastated.  Like Harold and Kumar devastated when they discovered that their closest White Castle turned into a hot dog joint.

When I arrived at Comme Ca it was for a late lunch and the place was pretty much empty by then.  That's a good thing for me since it would mean that I'd get extra attention from my server.  Her name was Britney and she was awesome!  I loved how she read my mind and knew that I was there for the Duck Confit Cinnamon Bun when I said I wanted something unusually different and waited a long time to try it.

So here it is!  Duck Confit Cinnamon Bun with smoked bacon frosting, huckleberry, and Pork Belly
http://bit.ly/Vn2SCt
Was it worth the hype?  You betcha!!!  It's funny how this is listed on the menu as an appetizer.  The taste is really unique when you have the sweetness from the bun and huckleberry and then combined with the smoked and savory flavor of the duck confit, bacon frosting, and pork belly slices, you have a kaleidoscope of flavors all over your taste buds.  Despite being an appetizer, it was really rich in that whole thing can fill you up.  It's like breakfast, lunch, and dessert all in one!  This definitely ranks as one of the best things I've ever eaten on the Vegas strip.

Yeah it may be a little too premature to give Comme Ca 5 stars based off of one lunch dish, let alone an appetizer, but the whole experience with the nice view of the strip, awesome service, and enjoying one of the one of the of creative dishes I've ever eaten, it totally says 5 stars all over!  I can't wait to go back next time!. Heavy on the seafood, not so heavy on the wallet. They have beer and sake! I'm already impressed. Vegetarians, prepare to hate me forever. I had:

Bacon-wrapped shrimp: I was skeptical at first, but this was good stuff! Tray after tray...piping hot...this seemed to be a real hit with customers.

Orange chicken: Good, and had so much of a kick to it I thought it was supposed to be General Tso's! Whatever it was, I'd eat more.

Honey chicken: Tasted great, but I have no clue why it was so oily. Watch out!

Mushrooms: They look better than they taste.

Coconut shrimp: Just regular shrimp in a delicious coconut sauce. Can't get enough!

If you raised your kids to be pussies who can't handle food that's different, you can grab them taquitos and pizza. There's something for everyone.

There's also a Mongolian grill, which you should try, and some pre-made sushi, which look good but should never be tried at any buffet. Just stuff your face with delicious chicken and fish, and wash it down with some Tsingtao and Sho Chiku Bai when you're thirsty. Buffet is only like $9, not including tip. WORTH IT. So while it's not by any means the best Chinese buffet I've checked out, you are for sure getting a good value. I'm a fan.. Normally, when you go salsa dancing, drinking profusely beforehand is not a good idea. Normally I'm not in Vegas....

Gold Coast was fun. Band started right at 11:00 PM and DJ played a variety of Latin styles (cumbia, merengue, bachata, etc) in between sets. Crowd was super mixed, except that...

...we knew we were in Vegas because I swear to you there was a table of "off duty" (quick, think of stripper synonym), um...exotic dancers. :-)

For $10 you get a DJ, a band and a voucher for a free drink. That's a pretty darn good deal for a place that's just off the strip. I will warn those of you who like mixed drinks though, that both the margarita and daiquiri tasted like they were so loaded with sugar we earned an instantaneous promotion to diabetes land!. I was working with Lori Murphy who was the most helpful realtor I have ever used!  She was flexible and available to anytime I asked her to meet at the property!  She is a very caring and sincere person, which is hard to find in a realtor.  If you get a chance to use Lori, you should!. Terry Fator absolutly hands down has amazing talent. And he has huge potential to get only better. However this is his first year at Mirage and show could be made a little bit more funny. I think that the best part of the  show was when he pulled someone from audience and made him sing. We got our tickets at half price at TIX4tonight by coca cola stand across Monte Carlo. I would definitly suggest doing it dunce they also have coupons for many hot spot restaurants in LV. Also they give you next day VIP pass so if you come back next day to buy other tickets you do not have stand in line + get even more discounts.. The rooms are very nice and super clean. We stayed in the larger unit "A". Now the hotel is about a 1/4 mile from the strip not to bad. There are a few food spots downstairs and a few stores that have pretty much everything you may need. You are right next to the airport but the noise really wasn't bad at all. The staff was really nice super helpful I was surprised. Walking down the halls was always nice cause it always smelled like they just mopped. The pool was really nice indoor with a bar and tv. We did the time share thing we didn't buy but I may go back and buy without the drama meet and greet. They were pushy but what do you expect. Over all I had a really nice stay.. I love the steak and beer deal get it every time family comes out its cheap, filling,  and good... gotta love a good vegas deal. May have to wait sometimes because it's a popular spot but it is definitely worth it.. Breakfast buffet ends at 11, and we got there at about 11:05, so I can only comment on lunch.
Quite varied, from some chinese food to pizza to lasanga to suishi to soup and salad and more.
As usual, each dish was a bit of a hit or miss, the pizza was very good as was the leftover waffles from breakfast, but the fried chicken i ate with the waffles left a bit to be desired.
I was pretty happy for my $17 or whatever.  (includes non-alcoholic drinks, which was pretty sweet). With a name like "Best Burger," I had to give it a try. I got the cheeseburger and my girlfriend got the 1/3 lb best burger and they were better than your average burger. I definitely recommend this over your ordinary fast food chain- the burgers weren't greasy and the toppings were fresh. Their fries and milkeshake weren't bad, either. 

So, when you first walk in, it seems like you've stumbled into a small sushi bar. That's b/c it is a sushi place now!  Best Burger has become a double agent and is also called Sushi Bong.  They feature your usual takeout Japanese favorites rice bowls, rolls, salads etc...  But, it does not end there they also have Korean BBQ. 

When you can't decide between a burger and fries or a spicy tuna hand roll, wait no longer now you can get both at the same place.  

Good burgers (pretty cheap,  less than $6 for a burger, friends, and drink), friendly service. I'd definitely come here again to get my cheap sushi or burger fix.. We've been here a few times and are never disappointed. This time, we went for breakfast. The service is usually pretty good, but this time, it was exceptional, and our server was very nice and energetic (understatement).

The food was very good. I had the corned beef hash and poached eggs. Depending on how much you eat though, the portions may be somewhat small. In addition to our main dishes, my wife and i shared an apple cinnamon waffle, or was it carmelized apple waffle, i dont remember. What i do remember is the apples tasted great and the waffle itself was so good. 

For our other meals here, we've always had lunch or dinner, and always opt for the steak frites. Food was very good and at a reasonable price, especially for vegas. Add that you even get an amazing view.. Worth finding. Sure it's in the back of a poorly lit grocery store, but it's clean, inexpensive, fresh, and delicious. Grab a Coke from the fridge (the stuff w/ real sugar not corn syrup) or order a horchata. If you're a big eater, try one of the enormous tortas. It's a hot sandwich with your choice of breaded chicken, pork, or beef, topped with fresh tomatoes, avacados, lettuce, cheese, and mayo. Half of one and I'm stuffed.

The little gorditas with chicharones are another favorite. A small tortilla, stuffed with spicy, crispy pork belly, deep fried, then stuffed with fresh cilantro, onion, and a little cheese.

Or if you're adventurous, try something off of the menu in Spanish. They're happy to translate if you don't know what the items are.

Definitely one of my local faves and you can visit all you want without breaking the bank.. If you like Indian food this, Origin is as good as it gets. All the meat is halal which is nice but if you're a practicing Muslim. If not then you have to order some cocktails off the very creative and extensive list created by resident bartender Joseph. He's crafted some very complex drinks using the same herbs, spices and ingredients the cooks are using in the kitchen. 

 I recommend the Black Mamba if you're getting something hearty like the lamb or chicken tikka. The Cucumber Pearl was light and  perfect for a vegetarian dish. The Lal Dupata (Red Veil) was also very good  with the chicken curry. We had a few more but I don't recall the names. Keep in mind these take a few minutes to make.

Very well done in the kitchen and the bar!. The best Beer Burgers and Frys in AZ.
If you're like me, a man who likes man shit then you'll love Wilderness.
If you're not like me you'll probably still love it too.. This park is beautiful.

I usually come here with my kids and we playing the whole day we like it here its really quiet and 
green .......

it's not crowded  like other parks.. I love the new setup of Carson Street Deli.  New bar seating.  More table seating.  Excellent selection of craft beers.   Excellent menu and sandwiches.  The Reuben that I had today was very good but Szmidt's Old World Deli in Greenfield is better if you are judging on the sandwich alone.. Went here quite awhile ago with my uncle... he stays at Harrah's properties regularly, and on this trip he was at the Flamingo.  I think they comped him dinner at the steakhouse.  It was actually well above average for a steakhouse, from memory.  Alas, I just heard today that it is not closed.  Not surprised as there's a million places to get a good steak in this town.. This is my home away from home, my Beat away from the Beat. They have the best mochas in town and the wi-fi is faster, but not as fast as their service. Grouchys is the jam!. Thank you fellow Yelpers for helping me find this fantastic spa! 

Walk in and you're greeted with a friendly smile (Amy is great!)  Check in, have a seat and enjoy a refreshing glass of fruit-flavored water while listening to the soothing waterfall. I enter a state of relaxation before I even get to the table. 

It only took one super-relaxing Serenity Massage for me to become a member of this spa. No brainer. $59 monthly includes a $79, 60-minute Serenity Massage plus great discounts if you want to go back more frequently. The Serenity is a full-body massage followed by a foot scrub and scalp massage. Fantastic!

The rooms are what you'd expect from a classy spa. Dark, comfortable tables, and the perfect mix of water and zen-like Asian flutes. I schedule well in advance and get email reminders for my upcoming appointments. 

New Serenity does it right. Beats the heck out of Docle' and Gadabout in my book. Give them a try, I think you'll agree.. I stumbled across this place while on my way back in from San Diego a couple weeks ago. We were still 45 mins out from home & everyone was starving so we stopped off I-10 & Litchfield Rd to get something to eat. We didn't know what to expect, but my wife, kids & I all love sushi so we gave it a go.

The 1st pleasant surprise was that it was Happy Hour from 3pm-Close on Sunday (the day we were there) and there were many great drink & food specials on the Happy Hour menu, which we ordered everything from.

The next pleasant surprise was that the sushi piece and serving sizes were generously LARGE. We left full, happy and impressed. I wish we lived closer to this place. If we did, we'd be regulars. Enjoy it if you're in the area, or make a plan to seek it out. If your experience was anything like ours, you'll be very pleased.. I lived right by here for years, never checking it out.  I recently ate here, and it was great.  Best pizza I have had yet in Phoenix.. Amazing.  Probably the best vegetarian food I've had in Charlotte.  My wife had the sweet potato gnocchi and I had the fry bread tacos.  Both were delicious, as was our starter - squash blossom hush puppies.  The beer donut desert was fine, but not quite as great as everything else.  We certainly will be going back.. Came in thinking I would give it a shot, I will be back very soon with how great he food and service was.. Great service everytime I go in. I called Arturo based on all the great reviews I found here on Yelp. After getting a heads up that he is always busy I called and he answered right away and told me the earliest he could see me was in two days. Since it was not an emergency I went ahead and booked the appointment. 

Arturo told me he would be here between 11-12 and he arrived right on time. My issue was I had what appeared to be water leaking through the ceiling of my garage. I was not 100% sure where the leak was coming from. Was it a broken pope in the walls ? It could have been anything. Arturo starting doing some investigating and we determined that the hot water valve from the washing machine has a slow leak. 

Just to satisfy my own curiosity I had Arturo pull a small section of the drywall in the garage to double check no actual leaking pipes in that area. Everything looked fine and after making some adjustments to the leaking valve everything was looking good. 

Arturo could have easily told me there was major issues and charged me for all sorts of things but he didn't. He double checked toilets, tubs and sinks just to cover all the bases and only made adjustments that were necessary and most cost effective .

His rate was more than fair and I wold not hesitate to call Arturo out for any other plumbing issues I might have in the future and neither should you!. I really enjoying coming to LGO with my girlfriend about 1 hour before closing.  We found that when we go too early there is very little parking and there is always a wait.  So we opted to go later and have found this to be the best time.  The wait staff is very nice and helpful around this time too, since it close to closing the staff is more relaxed and fun.  With less people in the place it also makes for a more romantic setting.

I really enjoy getting half Lime Avocado and half roasted corn pizza.  I feel you get the best of both worlds with this half and half.  Nice cool and smooth texture when you bite into the Lime Avocado slice and then the roasted corn slice gives you a pop of flavor and.

I have found that the wine selection has a few good choices to complete the pizza or if you are a pizza and beer person the beer selection is average.  You will be able to find a beer that you like on the list.

If you feel like getting a little desert when you are done with your meal then you go can walk next door and get some delicious gelato; that is if you get done with your dinner before they close.. One of the best breakfast places in this part of town.  The decor is very chic and electic.  Very fun for a strip mall place.  The crepes are amazingly delicious.  I've had the savory and sweet and both are airy and light on the crepe side and filling and scrumptious on the inside.  I highly recommend the flight's of Mimosa.  My Wife throughly enjoyed them with her crepe.   A must try if you are in this part of time for breakfast.. Outstanding. Food was great and the service was outstanding too. I had chicken and my wife the spaghetti and meatballs. Both meals were outstanding. Would for sure eat here again. Little pricey but worth it.. The Henry is the perfect restaurant. 

I was blown away by every aspect of The Henry. It's so beautiful inside, every detail is perfect and it's so spacious I could not get over it. Fox group could have added an additional 50 tables, but instead they left it open and it's just perfect in every way. 

The food was exceptional from start to finish. I won't bore you with the details but it was all amazing.  In one visit- I had to reorganize my list of favorite restaurants, with The Henry at the number one spot, it is incredible in every way. 

I look forward to many figure visits here. Amazing job everyone!. Best beans I've had in a long time.  Rice was also excellent. The Barbacoa and Carnitas tacos rocked!!!   One was better but I'm not sure which was which.  Cantinas always have a great atmosphere and the location is great!!   Enjoy.. Overall:  Really solid Mexican food with a bit of a Tex-Mex spin (burgers).

Food:  Really good, although they were out of the burgers when we got there (it was a Thursday evening)...which my wife was really Jonesin' for.  The pozole was really good, as was the quesedilla and tacos.

Price:  Very reasonable.  We got a ton of food for three people (couldn't' finish) and spent about $32 if I recall.

Service:  Nice people working there and pretty accommodating to make sure you get the food you want when ordering.  But service is pretty fast-food oriented and the tables didn't seem to be getting bused / cleaned much.

Atmosphere:  A bit lacking... pretty sure it's an old fast-food restaurant that has had basically no updates to align with the current owner/restaurant/offerings.  Most signs, etc. hand-made.  

Net:  Good stuff across the board.  Inexpensive (maybe $11/person? for tons for food).  We'll be back and will be making sure to get the burgers next time.

Tip:  If you're really craving the burgers (which seem to be a fav of many)... recognize that they can and do run out... you might want to call and see if they are still serving them right before you go.. I was told by a Chicago native to try this place before they even opened. It has been on my to-try list for over a year and I made it this weekend.
Best hot dog I have had in Phoenix.
Tried a hamburger, fries and onion rings too.
The Jumbo dog was excellent. Juicy without being greasy and I like the Chicago style fixins too. 
The hamburger was great. Not a toasted bun, but everything else was perfect. 
The Fries are awesome. Soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. 
Onion rings were a disappointment in my opinion. Batter to Onion ratio is to high for "my" liking.
I will be back.. It's been many, many years since I walked down a city street with a helium balloon on a string, but Mattress Factory Art Museum let me to do just that.  Sometimes you just have sing like no one is listening and bob down the street with your balloon like no one's watching...or pointing...or taking pictures of the freak.

Husband is not the *biggest* art museum fan (tho I'm slowly chipping away at him), so I was over-the-moon when he turned to me with a big grin on his face after paying a visit to the MFAM and announced how much he loved the place.  And for the AD/HD-afflicted gent that he is, MFAM's installation art exhibits are perfect.  They allow for you to walk through, participate, operate, or touch just about all of them, drawing you in and literally making you part of the art.

MFAM's two galleries -- the former Stearns & Foster mattress factory on Sampsonia and a row home a couple blocks away on Monterey -- house a small but powerful collection.  The permanent collection includes transsexual and drug addicted Greer Lankton's sensory stimulating "It's All about ME, Not You"; double mirrored-rooms plastered with polka dots that invite you to dance or make silly faces by Yayoi Kusama; and the sensory *depriving*, pitch black art of James Turrell, punctuated unexpectedly by colored light.  

For its temporary exhibits, MFAM brings artists from all over the world to Pittsburgh, sets them up in their very own artists' residences, and gives them free reign over their own gallery space in one of the museum's two buildings.  The result is thrilling (Jeremy Ficca's hovering floorboards), amusing (Gill Wildman's "House Says", in which he stenciled cheeky phrases and sayings all over the walls, doors, and even the exterior of 1414 Monterey), and poignant, like "Wish Exchange Dandelion" by Ling He.  Enter the room full of crystal-colored balloons dangling ribbon tails from the ceiling and realize the ribbons are covered with the hopes and dreams of patrons who've come before you: "I wish my sister could stop doing drugs," "I want my son to be happy and healthy," "I hope Obama wins in 2012"...write your own wish on a balloon's ribbon and leave it behind; but only if you take someone else's with you.  I left my dream behind and took, "I wish I was artistic" with me on our walk back through the Mexican War Streets and Allegheny Commons.

MFAM (and its insanely awesome, hip & trendy, arty-farty gift shop) is a place that will bring out your kid-at-heart.. Was referred to Najib's Barber shop through a friend.

He always cuts my hair exactly how I want it.  I've been getting my fades from Najib for the last 8 years.

His new spot is big and comfy and a good place to chill even if I'm not getting a fade.  

I recommend him to everyone.. I popped into West Elm last night for the first time.  I've seen the catalogs, but never been in an actual store.  It was quite nice, and once again I started dreaming of what it would be like to have all of this modern furniture and decor in my home.  Ahh... If only the lottery fairies would come my way. 

West Elm was all about the browns, silvers, and whites.  Most of their decor is "wood," from the tables and beds to the vases and bowls.  But they also offer other accent pieces.  Their inventory is a little on the slim side.  You won't find as much to browse through as you might in a Crate & Barrel or Pottery Barn, but it was still enjoyable to see things that I haven't seen in other similar stores.  

Their prices didn't seem too bad overall.  One of their dining room tables I liked was reasonably priced for around $400.  In fact, I might go back for a cool lamp I saw for $99 if I don't find another one I like.

I'm not sure about their customer service.  There were several employees floating around the store and clustered together at one point and not once did one say hello to me and welcome me to this new Charlotte store.   Granted, I don't like to be bothered when I'm shopping, but a hello might have been nice.  Maybe it was because I was by myself instead of coming in as a couple?  They were talking to the couples in there.  Hmmm.... The food was amazing...I ate the bacon BBQ burger med.rare and it was cooked to perfection... very delicious. I was also able to eat some of the shrimp fettuccine alfredo and it was really done well.. the noodles were al dente and the alfredo sauce was savoury... I highly recommend this place.. It's been a solid 8 months since my last review and nothing has changed. If anything the restaurant has gotten better!

There new staff up front Tuu-Tuu , Jackson , Brittany are amazing and work hard to deliver the best of service. 

"Big Daddy" the sushi chef is an artist with his food and is hilarious. I come frequently on the weekend to have drinks and just converse with him. He is a delight and very knowledgeable

Tom the owner will great you every time you walk through the door and makes it personal when you eat at his establishment. He takes pride in his unique flavors and crafty ingenuity that you can clearly separate Comapred to other Vietnamese places.

Well done Angelina's Team! Keep it up and I'll keep coming back week after week.. Boozy slurpees?  Hell, yes!

I really enjoyed my Jack & Coke slurpee.  You can save your glass for a cheaper refill.  On my second go-around, I opted for the frozen margarita with an extra shot.

This is an amazing concept that needs to be in every city in America.  Cheers!. I agree with everyone, and for a good reason. They are the nicest and coolest staff you will meet running a restaurant. The cocktails and food are completely different and amazing. I joined yelp just so I could write about them.. Visited Vegas for the first time and the family wanted to try this place. I don't know who Giada is but everybody else did and that's all that matters I suppose. 

Art on the walls is cool - I'm told it's mostly stuff related to her grandpa.

We had reservations, but still had a bit of a wait before being seated so we had some drinks in the lounge area. The menu is on an ipad which is probably not necessary but would be cool if you could order from it or it offered anything a printed menu couldn't.

After we were pretty much done with our first round of drinks in the lounge were seated by a big poster of Barbarella and given the rundown of the menu and whatnot. Prices were a bit high but we took this opportunity to not care a ton about cost and just ordered what we thought would be a satisfying amount of food. We all ordered and somewhat shared our food. I had lemon potatoes, charred octopus, and pappardelle pasta. All of it was pretty good and I didn't leave hungry or too full. Food was prepared well and the octopus was one of the better I've had.

What I really liked were the drinks. The Destroyer and Serpico were pretttty delicious and not something I could just go order anywhere I don't think. If I'm ever back to Vegas I would go back here solely for the cocktails.

Everyone had a good time, nothing was crappy, all in all a success - just sort of spendy, so know that's what you're getting yourself into here.. Let me just start by saying I'm sorry this review is so long, I started out thinking I would just write a short one, but ended up sharing my entire experience with the hope that other users will find it informative. 

I walked into shane co for the first time in August of 2014 with my girlfriend. We were greeting and asked if we needed help finding anything by 3 or 4 different people. We gave them the typical "were just looking, thank you" answer as we had been to a few other jewelry stores and didn't want to feel pressured again. (Tip to other jewelry stores, I'm not going to buy a ring right in front of my girlfriend, the whole idea was a surprise. Just because we were looking didn't mean I wanted her to know when it was going to happen) so after browsing for a good 20-30 minutes, we realized the selection and prices here were by far cheaper, for better quality, than the other stores we had looked at. 

Once we realized the quality of what we were looking at, we finally decided to talk with someone. Enter Leon. He was very friendly but I still assumed we were going to get the samw pressure as other stores, but this was not the case. There was no pressure to buy. He asked some questions, "how long have you been together", typical things the jeweler asked you. What surprised me was the fact that he spent over an hour and half with us, pulling different rings, different diamonds, anything we could want to see, leaving multiple rings and diamonds out so we could compare side by side as opposed to looking at one, putting it back in the case, pulling another like we saw at other stores. Finally after almost 2 hours I finally had a general idea of what my girlfriend would like. 

About three to four weeks later, I entered shane co on my own, confident in what I was doing. Leon saw me as I walked in the door, stopped what he was doing and said "Travis! Good to see you again" the personalization was unlike anything I could have expected. He helped me look at rings again until I found the perfect one. Because I wasn't sure exactly when I wanted to "pop the question" Leon recommended that I use there lay a way program. You can put a ring on lay a way for up to 1 year, making monthly payments, with no interest. And if you ever wanted to cancel you would get all of the money back. 

About a month later I went in to pick out a diamond. Leon was there again and greeted me right away. After an hour of questions about diamonds, I thought I had finally found the perfect diamond for her. The process to add it to my layaway program was quick and easy. Over the next 4-5 months I would go in and make my payment (you can make a payment over the phone, but I preferred to use cash in case she looked at the bank statements) every time I was there I would ask to see the diamond placed in the ring again as I wanted to make sure it was perfect. In February I decided to take one more look at diamonds as I knew I was getting close to when I wanted to ask. Leon spent another hour and half with me until I decided I wanted to switch from a cushion cut, to a radiant diamond. The process to change it on my layaway plan was quick and easy. And I was out the door. 

On may 27th I walked into the store ready to pay it off. I was planning to ask my girlfriend to marry me on June 6th. Made the payment and they said the ring would be ready by Friday. I ended up going in on the next Monday, June 1st, and realized I didn't let them know I wanted them to set the diamond real low (it's a double halo ring and wanted it tiered for three layers) they set it in the typical higher fashion like many other rings, immediately I started to panick, not that it didn't look great, but I knew it wouldn't be the way she wanted it. I told them I was looking to ask this week, the assured me it was no problem, that they would put a rush order on it and could lower the setting and it would be ready that same night!  It ended up being perfect. 

To say that I had a great experience at shane co would be an understatement. For one person. To easily spend 15-20 hours with me over the course of me changing 
my mind and I didn't get the hint he was ever annoyed, or wanted to do something else, was fantastic. He could see how excited I was every time I was there, and he took his time with me and shared my enjoyment. THANK YOU TO LEON AND EVERYONE ELSE AT SHANE CO!  You made the experience better than I could have imagined and she loved her ring!. A sports bar... A casual bar.. The Well Bar...

Great place to watch games (especially the Ducks) or play pinball, darts and pool. It has friendly bar staff and friendly regulars. Come in and meet a few.. I took my girlfriend here for our anniversary, and the service was fantastic! She got the NU natural (chemic free) pedicure. The owner's name is Tracy, and she was wonderful! We highly recommend one woman day spa!!. I like the staff  they are very nice with everyone .They seem to care about each person that's  there for a fast recovery.. Lately I've been on the Mary-Kate & Ashley diet... but every so often, a man needs to gorge himself on carbs. When I decide to eat with reckless abandon, Barro's Pizza is usually my very first choice on the list. Their hot wings are the best I've had on this side of the Mississippi, and the pizza is everything a thick crusted vehicle for sauce, melted cheese, and crispy pepperoni should be.  To top it off, this particular location is fairly vast in size, has all sorts of flat screens showing all sorts of sports, and the friendliest, most attentive staff I've ever encountered at a casual pizza place. Finally- an XL 1 topping pizza 24 hot wings, and 3 drinks rings up somewhere under $32. Yes. Yes. Yes. :D. I come here at night all the time with my coworkers and it is the best Thai food place in the charlotte area.  It is even in my top 3 Thai food places and there are some good places in NYC area where I am from.  Some must tries are: 

pad see ew: you can choose your protein including Tofu if vegetarian.

pad moon sen:  I love the different flavors and colors of all the topping/veggies.  

red curry:  if your into coconut based curry this is a decent choice and u can have a choice of brown or white rice (extra charge for brown rice).  

I will be back here a ton and will try new things!  Enjoy!. I had the California burrito...legendary! The tostadas and tacos are huge. My new main mex food joint.. Superb chicken sandwich and amazing freshly made bread. If you are around, you must come by and give it a try.. This place was fantastic my wife and I came on their first opening night and the food was fantastic so much so we came back the second night the food was as consistent as ever Betty the manager is fantastic chuck our waiter was very knowledgeable and very very pleasant and made our night this is the jewel of downtown Las Vegas. We were hesitant to try a new Pho place because we are in love with our regular spot, but were pleasantly surprised with this place. Unfortunately they were out of Thai ice tea, but the egg rolls were great as well as the chicken potstickers. I was disappointed with chicken curry plate but tried a few dishes at my table and everything else was wonderful. I will definitely be either ordering the Pho or Stir fry next time. It was a nice clean environment and the staff was very helpful and friendly. Will be adding this to our list of regular spots for sure.. I rated them on 6/8/12 based on my stay then.  I can't believe I didn't login to finish it.  I LOVE the HRH!  Fun gaming, awesome rooms, near perfect service (the hotel, not the restaurants - there is a difference, thus 4 instead of 5 stars).  

My biggest tip is to stay in the Casino or HRH tower.  The Paradise tower is nice, but it's a long walk from the casino.

I've stayed at the HRH numerous times.  It's definitely my favorite hotel in Vegas.. The food was very good and service great. Atmosphere is a little cold but it's really about the food. I would go back.. The. Real. Deal. 

Finally, after months of beating the bushes and getting greasy fast food Indian everywhere we followed a trail to Express Indien and I'm putting it down as the best we've found of the dozen or more Montreal places. The small dining room isn't fancy but it's not gross either. It's a little hole in the wall place and the chef came out to talk to us--that kinda place. 

Perfect pakoras, flakey and not at all greasy. Wife got the chicken Tikka Masala, I got butter paneer, both were excellent. Lassi was great, naan was great, rice was solid. Everything you could ask for in real Indian that's neither served from a bucket nor pretending to be fancy. Go give these people your business.. Parking is a nightmare!!!!! If you can ride a bike or walk, do! That said, the cocktails are very tasty and they have a menu full of interesting bourbons. The place is great for going and sitting with an old friend or a lady for drinks. The patio seating is very cool, lots of fires and festival lights. The food for the price is only okay, i wish it was either better or cheaper by a few bucks (both would be great, but this is the real world). I've had a few decent burgers and sandwiches but they are on the small side and will not "wow" you. The beer selection could be bigger but the beers I've had all very tasty. 
Huge bonus: next door to the place is churn! Delicious, possibly life changing ice cream. You should definitely go there afterward.. I'm not a vegan but the food here is great. You come out of there feeling very healthy too. The environment is also very nice and modern.. The house beer here... My friend and I dropped in here for our first times and ordered it. The sweet aroma of that brew was hard to pinpoint. I said some sort of berry, he said orange, and our waitress claimed cannabis. From that point on I was sold.

Overall, I like this place. The look and ambience of the Roosevelt with their beer selection and presentation makes for a wholly enjoyable experience. It's definitely worth all the trouble trying to find the place. Depending on how you look at it, the size of this place is either a pro or a con. It's a good thing in that it builds a relaxed and quiet atmosphere, but it might be a negative in the case where the space gets filled easily. The bar is literally a house that they converted which I find cool, but I will admit that some of the rooms give off a claustrophobic feel.

The Roosevelt definitely is and will be a staple of the burgeoning arts district, so try to go by there before it becomes too well known. Make sure to check out the crazy good berry-citric-weed beer too and keep the secret to yourself.. I have to give The Plaza credit for doing a nice renovation on an iconic property downtown.

In comparison to The Plaza of yore, the newly renovated version is a nice refresh.

My stay here was a single night "staycation" following a downtown charity event with complimentary drinks.

Upon check-in, the service was a little slow as they only had 2 front desk staff working on a Saturday evening.  Once I got to the the desk, the service was great.  The staff was extremely friendly.  The elevator security and bellmen all greeted the guests and wished everyone a pleasant stay.

The room was very nice and clean, although small.  The hotel is 40 years old after all.  The furniture was very modern and the bed was very comfortable.  I'm told their renovation included purchasing of furniture from the abandoned Fontaine Bleau project.  All of the amenities in the room were very nice.

We ended up at The Swingers Club at the end of the night.  A fun little themed bar with 2 cute bartenders in their schoolgirl themed uniforms having a great time with patrons, pouring shots in mouths while standing on the bar.  It was a shame that there wasn't many people there, but our group still enjoyed ourselves.

I passed on the restaurants, as yet another Hash House exists in town, and sushi wasn't on the agenda for the group that night.  But I'm anxiously awaiting the opening of our former mayor's new steakhouse, "Oscar's".  With the slogan, "Beef, Boooze, & Broads", how can it not be great?!!!

Anyway, for the value, Plaza gets 4 stars from me.  My expectations were appropriately set before my arrival, and were exceeded.

Good job!. Great room, got the terrace suite. Had two bathrooms a kitchen and a living room separate from the bed room. Plenty of space if you want to entertain random people from the clubs. What I thought was great is that you can actually go out on the balcony! Had a great view of the billagio fountains. Other hotels I have been to have the balcony locked, I guess they are afraid of jumpers. There are many clubs in the area we ended up at haze after bouncing from club to club. Pauly d was the dj witch was pretty cool. Valet service was great although they did not want to take my truck initially on account of my friend puked all over it on they way there. Thats a whole other story.... But all in all great place to stay would love to go back without puke face. Its also worth noting that they have a secret pizza kitchen! Call room service for the best pizza on the strip!. "Everybody Want A Piece of My Chicken
Southern Fried Chicken
Finger Lickin' "-- Ms Peachez 

These are the words that ring in my head every time I know I'm going to get some Fried Chicken & Waffles(C&W); for those who don't know what I'm talking about, do me a favor and search YouTube for: "Ms Peachez". Go ahead, I'll wait... Pretty funny, eh? Anyways, I'm always down to grub on some C&W and after seeing the solid reviews for Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles (LLCW) I knew I had to make a stop here on my tour de Arizona. Fortunately, their Scottsdale location is less than 1-mile from Scottsdale Stadium and I leapt at the opportunity.

Sides:

Cornbread- This is a pretty tasty Northen-style Cornbread and for only $1/each you can't beat that deal with a stick! One of my dining companions loved it so much he ordered one for the road! 4*

Entrées:

#8 DD: x2 Fried Chicken Breasts and Waffle- The chicken coating was crispy and tasty, but the chicken itself was a bit dried-out. The Waffle was nice and crisp but I would've preferred it to be thicker--however the taste was very good. Overall, not as good as Lillie Mae's back in San José but it hit the spot. 3*-Chicken/4*-Waffle

Puffs Chicken Tender Basket- I was a bit disappointed to see that LLCW doesn't have a children's menu; so, I had to order my 3-year-old an adult meal, which is OK -I suppose- who doesn't love leftovers? This came with 3 Chicken Tenders and Fries and he gobbled it up pretty well. 4*-Lance Rating

Drinks- All you have to know is they have Kool-Aid, and they serve the Purple flavor (aka Ghetto Grape). 'Nuff said. 5*

Service & Ambiance- Service from our waiter, Carl, was terrific! He was super-friendly, helpful and on top of things. LLCW is a really chill diner-style atmosphere that's kept clean and has some neat chicken paraphernalia decorating the place. 5*-Service/4*-Ambiance

Value- Pretty decent value and a bit cheaper than Lillie Mae's; we paid a little under $15/head for a copious amount of food and drinks. 3*

I really like LLCW and I'd probably rate it at a solid 3.5-stars, but the friendly service, great atmosphere, and fun menu will give it that 4-star bump. My only wish is they would get a children's menu and then they'd really have something. Irregardless, I'd still give it a hearty recommendation.. I have never went to dicks and stayed for hours at the bar drinking , I would just have dinner and leave. I went to dicks with my roommate for a getaway and we went to dicks for dinner at about 5pm when we rolled out of bed and ended up staying there until 1130om. Papi our bartender made it fun we socialized with a group of girls there and just had a great time. I will be going back in October and plan on hitting up dicks again. Tasty.  Not too greasy, not too salty.  Quick delivery.
Fresh ingredients.
Fast delivery... use the computer based ordering system... very efficient.
Overall very good food and experience.. Lovely ambiance in this Arcadia shopping strip. They did away with the traditional storefront and installed a beautiful accordion door that really opens the space up. This creates a lovely atmosphere for the patrons and as well the workers! Workers are super friendly and always have a smile on their face. Great coffee and pastries. This is a great neighborhood coffee house if you live in the Arcadia area, or work near by. I recommend the French Press  with the Vanilla Cinnamon Twist bean!  Will come here often!. Was invited by work friends that actually do B2B business with Howard. Was presently surprised. Loved the Vibe, the venue, and the talent they had was right up my alley. Gloves off comedy is the best. Definitely recommend this spot for something different on a Friday and Saturday when Old Town  gets old. Howard also gave out free tickets to everybody because the show went late. To me that was a Win-Win. Appreciate it Howard and the Stand-Up crew.. Been here twice. Very good food. Full bar. Group friendly. Live music. Great service.. I'm a big Khoury's fan. I think it's because it has that Mom & Pop feel while still providing an incredible selection of spirits to satisfy all tastes. I believe they have two locations. This one just happens to be closest to my house.

Every time I go in there, I am greeted warmly. And when I check out, I always get useful information on what I just purchased or advice on other things to try. In other words, the staff at Khoury's know their liquor!

Bonus 1-up info: They typically have free wine tasting on Wednesday evenings from 6-8pm. I've only been once though. What's wrong with me?. I've actually had two experiences by the time of this review

1st experience was on a Tuesday, when they had their $2 female blue crab special. Service was great and the waiters were nice. +1 right off the bat, they keep your water filled ! XD Restaurant was maybe 1/2 full? maybe a little less (around 5ish pm). not bad. 

I had ordered 5 crabs while my other friends ordered 3 more. As one of my pictures (and many other peoples pictures) show, they pour it on the table. The crabs come out on a tray the waiter carries over, and dumps it on top of a large brown butcher paper they place on the table beforehand. They give you a hammer and a knife, and just let u go at it. I've been eating crabs all my life and have prepared them so i pretty much know how to open and eat them pretty easily (granted blue crabs are smaller and require more work). Seasoning was yummy. The texture of the meat was good. and each shell had a decent amount of "yummy stuff" that probably only asian's eat. XD The only complaint i have of this experience is it had a slight, very slight taste that seemed it may have not been as fresh? as i had hoped (well this was my first experience so had nothing to compare). aside from that, it was great. it was a very slight taste so it didnt bother me too much. I also had ordered a side of sweet potato fries which were fried wonderfully. great color. crispy but still soft on the inside. 

2nd experience was much better. We were served by David. (Don't let looks intimidate you). Very nice guy ! This time was on a Saturday late afternoon (4:30 - 5pm). Got the opportunity to try this place again, started with a few appetizers. First off was the mini crab cakes.. small 1 oz crab cakes, maybe the size of a silver dollar. Nice golden brown color, served with lemons and tartar sauce. Very fresh taste, sweetness from the crab meat. Delicious. 2nd appetizer was the Annapolis Crab Dip. I actually had forgotten to read the description but sounded yummy. It came, already on sliced baguette, but loaded. The baguette was a little on the soft side, had a little trouble picking it up (could have been toasted a little more). The "dip" was very creamy and rich, and of course, lots of crab meat. Very heavy but delicious nonetheless. 

As for the entrees, my friend had ordered the Alaskan Cod and fries (she's not a shellfish eater so she opt'ed for the fish). She liked it. She said it reminded her of the fish from Crown & Anchor ! surprising ! +1 for crab corner. The seasoning they used with the fries, was delicious. I'd probably assume its the same seasoning they use for everything else, which makes it addicting ! ! Last but not least, the big entree. Came in a semi large pan. 3 male blue crabs, 4 pieces of corn, probably a handful of shrimp, and lots of clams and mussels on the bottom swimming in probably the water it was cooked it, topped with their very own special Maryland seasoning. I actually put the crabs off to the side and dug into the smaller things first. Shrimp was wonderfully cooked, perfectly seasoned. Cooked to perfection. Easy to peel shells. Mussels and clams were cooked nicely. Of course there's a few in there that had sand but there's nothing really the chef can due, in terms of those types of shellfish. The sand is inside the meat, and the shell is closed, so there is only so much you can do prior to cooking. The corn was nicely cooked, seasoned with their seasoning, once again. Was yummy, ate them all but didnt eat it, uhm, nicely like i usually do with corn, where i can get almost each kernal completely out cleanly. These corn, i just went at it and just mowed it down. yummy ! now the blue crabs. These were actually male blue crabs (can tell by lookin on the bottom. females have a rounded flap whereas males have a point at the end). Meat texture was great. seasoning was great. good amounts of "yummy stuff" i had mentioned earlier in the review. NO "unfreshness" taste at all this time. Cleaned the meat out of the crab. YUMMY ! so much work, but YUMMY ! 

All in all, the 2nd visit had pretty much made me re-consider this place, and maybe possibly putting it up there in one of my more favorite restaurants now. Everything is fresh. Prices are pretty good for the quality of food you get. Can't really find this elsewhere in the city. Heard they are opening another location on the west side (YES!!! MY SIDE!!!) near Tropicana and Fort Apache. Looking forward to that. But i'll definitely recommend people who like seafood to check this place out. I'll even tell my mom ! she's off on tuesdays too! sweet !. Ate here last night. Ask for the Gamblers Special. $7.99 for steak and shrimp with mash potato. Great deal.. the absolute best Pho I have EVER had.  That broth is perfection.  Like, really, perfection.  It has the perfect flavor.  I don't know what it is, but it is amazing.  The restaurant is seriously no frills.  I realized that I don't need frills.  I need Pho.  Good Pho.  I can't say that the front isn't a bit disturbing, but I can look past it, because the soup is just so good.  I highly recommend this place.  Highly.  Seriously.  I wanna go there right now.. I enjoy this mall very much! It has increased in what I like to call "class" from past years. They have added some nicer shops and it is no longer the "Senior Sweet Spot." Yes, it used to have a high population of older people but that's not bad. It is hard to find a few good shops here but it isn't that bad. It has a nice leisure type feel to it, in the sense that you go and just stroll past a few good shops. They also have some great restaurants nearby such as the Flat-Top Grill and a Great Dane location. They also have the renowned Sun Dance Theater with a lot of great abstract movies there (some very left-wing political movies in my opinion). All-in-All I think it is a nice establishment that has some great potential to become even better!. I've been on a healthy eating kick lately so I haven't had many delicious burgers.  After a rough day at work, my wife and I decided we needed some greasy food and this sounded just right!  I had been to a Five Guys in NYC last year but didn't really remember it.  I have to say, this was a great burger.  

I had burger with cheese, bacon, grilled onions, and pickles.  It really hit the spot and satisfied my burger craving.  The Cajun fries were good as well.  These burgers are pretty big but it was so good I wish I had two.  Well, I had one and a half because my wife couldn't finish hers.  I love how they dump extra fries in the bag.  I really don't eat fries that much anymore but if you're going to eat them, you might as well go big!

I worked out extra hard the next day and it was like it never happened.  But the taste remained and I can't wait to go back!. I give this a little less than 4 stars. I haven't been to a ton of pricier sushi places but this place had some great food. Salmon sushi was pretty run of the mill. 
The crispy rice was great. 
The Kobe beef pot stickers were the highlight. 
Baked scallop roll was right behind the pot stickers. 
Baked lobster roll I had high hopes for but didn't quite hit the mark. 

Again another place where I loved the look and feel of the restaurant, are you seeing the trend in my reviews? The wait staff was just so so my food came out quick (being sushi and having dinner at 8pm in Vegas) but my server wasn't around much to order more drinks or food after the initial greeting. The drinks were pricey and very small not to mention weak, so me having 5 in an hour probably contributed to the high price of my bill. All and all, I would return for a few select menu items and maybe try some new ones.. Great food, great staff,. I have been here before and would have given it 2 or 3 stars. It seemed to be hit and miss. But after going back after not having been for awhile I will say they may have upped their game. Maybe. Now I would give it 3 and 1/2 maybe even 4 stars.

Going here reminds us why we like local/Mom and Pop places. Unlike corporate places that spend millions of dollars to make sure that the staff treats everyone in that same kind of fake way and that everything on the menu can be made in a certain amount of time so it should all come out quickly so they can continually heard the masses through all night long, they are a little rough around the edges. They have remodeled and it is much more open and a lot nicer but still not perfect. It seems like they have paired down the menu a little so you are not bombarded with choices and can make up your mind a little easier. The staff is great and they seem like they genuinely want to take care of you and not in some fake way. My waitress was Lauren and she was helpful and very nice. Told us about the specials that we asked about and even made a special order drink that was technically not on the menu.

The bread was very good and they even add Parmesan cheese in a little pile on the side of the usual oil and vinegar blend. Sure the food took a little longer to come out but you know it is being made fresh and by someone who cares how it comes out. Plus you can see right into the kitchen so you know there are no microwaves. I ordered the Linguine with white clam sauce. Now normally I am more of a fan of cream sauces vs wine sauces but this was really good. Lots of clams cooked just right none of them were tough. Sure there were a few garlic cloves that didn't quite get chopped up all the way but like I said rough around the edges. It is that little hint that it was really homemade.

The prices are good. My plate was filled to the brim and I did not leave hungry. The service might be a little slow but it from genuine people not someone who has been drilled endlessly with corporate best practices and mission statements and garbage like that.

So maybe this was a hit. I will go back and see if they hit again. Maybe the misses are over with. Only another visit will determine that but they did earn a return visit for sure.. Came for brunch. We had the shrimp and grits and BLT, coffee, OJ, toast. 

- We liked the energy of the restaurant. 
- the shrimp were just a little over cooked
- the grits were good, and dipping the toast into the surrounding sauce was fantastic!
- the BLT was good.
- the house made chips were great. 
- the best part was sitting at the counter and watching the kitchen staff. Best show in town :P. Wow!! I saw this show a year ago and I'm still thinking about it.

As soon as I entered the theatre, I was greeted by staff already in costumes and acting their part. Even before the show started and while everyone is getting seated, we see tribal/barbaric people swinging around the theatre and running around on the floor  yelling and screaming in an unknown language. I didn't know what to think, but I loved it!

There is a very Asian theme to the show. The costumes were Asian influenced. There was martial arts in the acrobatics. It reminded me of a Peking Opera.

The huge rotating and moving multi-purpose platform was crazy! It's just so interesting how it is used in almost all the scenes. 

The music is great, memorable, and really enhances the story. 

Unlike the other Cirque shows, there is a simple and easy to follow story that just pulls the whole show together.

I can definitely recommend this show. It may not have the most original or best plot, but it just works together as a whole and there was quite a few acrobatics that left me gasping!. I was in need of an urgent care facility, and after reading some of the other reviews posted here, I decided to take a chance on FastMed Urgent Care on Ray Rd.  
Every member of the staff there were professional, courteous, and efficient. Each of them listened to my problem.... I mean they REALLY listened and provided me with some of the best care I've ever had at an urgent care facility. Best of all, I got a diagnosis with a complete description of exactly what was wrong, a prescription with detailed instructions for use, and advice to come back in a few days if the prescription didn't work for me.  That's a rare thing these days.  
Oh yes, one very important detail. I was in and out in LESS than an hour!!! Granted, it was a Saturday afternoon and when I walked in the waiting room was empty.  But still, under an hour?  Amazing!!!
My heartfelt thanks to Dorota, the PA on staff that day, to Tom at the front desk and to Valerie, the RT for a very pleasant experience and the relief I desperately needed. Whenever I need urgent care again, this is the place I'll go!. It's fun, it's quaint.. Stopped in with the kiddos today for lunch.

The server/bartender had about a 1/2 dozen tables and serviced us all well. Multiple refills and check ins.

The food did take a while, but not too long for a real burger and there was one guy in the kitchen doing everything. I could see straight into the kitchen and saw the guy wash his hands. I appreciate his proper hygiene.

The food was very good and a good value at lunch menu prices.
One kid got the battered chicken fingers, she got a nice pile. The other kid plate came with 2 nice sized sliders and fries.

I am not a fan of truffle oil on fries and they get heavy handed with the truffle oil. Nobody else seemed to mind, just my personal taste. The sweet potato fries were good.. I love going to the drive in! Its so fun and cheep! Plus you get to see 2 movies for the price of one and there not crap movies. We like to back our truck up, open the back, put all of the food and drinks out and then sit on lawn chairs. The kid(s) can stand up and stretch and have a great time. 

There is a concision stand where you can buy food, candy and drink if you forgot stuff, but bring your own if you can. Also bring a little boom box for the radio station so you don't have to waste the battery in your car. We saw some people having to get jumped the last time we where there because they had their car radio on for like 4 hrs and it died. 

Go give it a try its really fun and worth the $6 to get in!. I am happy that they are now 24 hours. That makes it a lot easier to stop here versus a store like Albertson's. Daily specials and price slashes make shopping here late at night awesome...which is when I am usually there.. Is this place 5 star? No but it is a solid 4 given it's location. Say what you want but I've had much worse than this and they are located in much better situation. 

If you get the to go boxes that they have then plan on lower quality. You have to get it made fresh or don't bother. I've had the to go boxes as well and they are ok if you get them early.. I'm a tourist who stumbled upon this place after riding the Duquesne Incline and seeing no other reasonably priced eat/drink options. Our server was Liz and she was rad! There were all kinds of beer options that were mostly $3-$5 per pint. Everything we ordered was good. Caesar salad, pork poppers (happy hour app), cheesesteak. I really liked the Gnarly and Honey Garlic Habanero flavored wings. Also, we had our 7 year old and 13 month old with us who were welcomed during daytime hours.. Good Vegetarian is hard to find, but this place Does It Right!

The Bottom Line:  Unusual and Delicious 'Veggie' Dishes.  Casual atmosphere. Lots of great beverages.  I would recommend for anyone that has Vegetarian to feed, and for anyone just trying to eat healthier.

I like Vegenation and I am not a Vegetarian.  My Daughter is. If she likes it, you can be sure it's good. And she can't wait till we go back.

Entrees:  We had the Out of Africa Stew and LITTLE SOUL Ravioli Black Eyed Peas & Collard Greens.  Both were Great!  The stew was just a little spicy, but not really HOT, if you are worried.  The Ravioli's disappeared like magic. Yum!

Drinks:  We had the fresh brewed Mango Iced Tea, and loved it. But it's just  Iced Tea.  Next time I want to try something a little more adventurous, like LEMONADE WITH COCONUT WATER CHIA SEEDS.

Next Visit:  PHO-KING-DELICIOUS with a GREEN MACHINE SMOOTHIE. My review comes after 3 separate occasions where I have had the chance to eat here.  The first was not so overwhelming as I was disappointed my check was charged an 18%  gratuity for lack-luster service.  In addition to that, there was a space to add a gratuity as if it had not already been added....very underhanded.

The food on this winter Sunday morning made up for the billing issue.  We had a group of friends meet there for breakfast on a Sunday and ended up staying for over three hours.  Honestly my memory fails me of the dish I ordered but finishing it was not a problem as it was quite good.  In fact, everyone there was happy if not impressed with their choices. 

The 2nd venture there was with my best friend Melissa.  We were limited on time and called ahead for our lunch to be eaten there.  When we walked in, sure enough, our food was waiting for us on the table, covered with foil to keep it hot.  Simple lunch specials but delicious nonetheless.  Mel and I we quite impressed they took the time to follow through with the order , get it right, keep it hot and make us feel so valued when in fact they had no idea who was coming to dinner.  Two very enthusiastic thumbs up for the service!

Visit #3 was again with Melissa and also for lunch.  This time we were not so hard pressed to get out of there so we were able to relax a chat up the place.  Very simpleton in the decor department but I am not there to be impressed with a pretty picture.  Does the food taste authentic and would I eat there again....these are the real questions.  

The answers are YES and YES!  Delicious, hot, reasonably fast and a place I will be going back to soon.  The lunch specials are cheap, filling and worth a repeat visit!  Comparing it to some other Mexican places in the immediate area, this one is one of the betters ones, hands down. 

Enjoy!. Absolutely incredible. Definitely a hidden gem of the east side of town. Food is deliciously fresh and well prepared and the service is excellent. The prices are also very low for the quality/service.. Great XLB. Keep on coming back to this place. My favorite dish is the cumin lamb, it reminds me of Mediterranean dishes. The service is very friendly and this must be the cleanest place in China town!!! Even the restrooms are spotless. Highly recommended.. The first time I walked by the Good Food cart and noticed a swift moving line and a small crowd of onlookers salivating I took notice. After briefly studying the menu I opted for the Gourmet Greek with hummus. A few steps and a couple of bites later I came to understand the scene outside of the little red cart.

I've been back numerous times since that first visit and have tried most of the menu. Everything is outstanding, the price is right, fast and consistent and most importantly the proprietor has mad people skills, and always smiling.

Hat's off to you Good Food!. First time at this amazing "new" place. Food was excellent and our server (Jordan) took great care of us, all of his suggestions were spot on. Great selection of beers too. We will be back for sure.. Awesome hotel for the family! Very clean, lots of space and lots of staff keeping it secure. I've been to most of the major hotels around the strip and this one is by far the best. Because there's no casino in the lobby, the hotel feels very clean, upscale and smog free. 
If you're looking for a place to stay with the family, then this is the place!. This place is awesome, who doesn't love free beer? I accepted the challenge to drink a pint in under 7 seconds, and killed it. However, it's extremely cold... but that still didn't stop me from doing it a second time. Highly Recommend this joint!. Please bring your last few dollars to support these guys!  I was so cynical on a first trip out there last year (developing a 'nevadatude') I figured it would be too small to survive very long like a pupfish or something out in the harsh desert country. Small can be good.

So happy shock and awesomeness when I got the Yelp newsletter about local groceries and there it was, still vending out nature's goodness!  yay for Batali - that man rocks.

We got some fruit and  sushito peppers we tried recently at Roy's as an appetizer (the peppers, not the fruit) grilled em up w/salt and garlic. Yum-o

So squeeze in and smile at the girls on your way to the peaches. Its all good.. Can you review water?  I think so.  I hope so since we're mostly made up of water and so is the Earth.  Great price, service and one heck of a cute dog that will greet you at the door on occasion.. What an awesome experience! Great service and award winning meal. We had the Signature Lemongrass Curry with Japanese Eggplant. Awesome flavor and very fresh. Also had the Rainbow Wonder. A colorful mix of grilled fresh veggies.

This restaurant is the future of dining! Every meal is cooked to order. The effort that goes into the preparation of each dish is rewarding.  

The owners should be rewarded with expanding to multiple locations. We drove from Sun City West just to try this place . Well worth the drive but would love to see more locations some day. 

The only other similar restaurant we can compare this to is Thai Vegan in Albuquerque New Mexico.

This IS the future of dining so go check out this wonderful restaurant.. Had the pigs and grits. Ordered quickly but it took them a while to bring the food out. Like 20 mins. Dont go if you are in a hurry unless you are ordering take out. They have a ton of bbq sauces. All real great. Prices are good. Food is great. In the mood for bbq or breakfast try it.. Great service, professional, and great quality. These guys know what they are doing. Several family members and friends have had cars tinted here and I just got my headlight protection done. I am always a little nervous to leave my car in someone else's hands, especially when its brand new but this is the only place to go. Will never go anywhere else.. This place is the bomb! I used to get the half rack of pork ribs and they were delicious, but a little pricey. Since then I have graduated to the "Deal of the Day". I typically come in on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Let me tell you this is a literally smokin' deal. You get two meats of the day plus two sides of your choice, pickle, onion, a roll and a large drink. This is for about $9. The meats are just incredible. Pulled pork, cheesy sausage, pork ribs, you name it. Strangely, I have never availed myself of the free soft-serve ice cream, but I know it's there if I want it. The location is excellent: near campus, but off the beaten path of Mill Avenue, so you won't be tripping over dirty hippies on your way in the door.. Oh Man...  What a difference a visit makes.     Hey last time I was there they sat us on tiny litle tables by the bar...   only big enough for kids I think, but ...    they have replaced those with high tops...  Also last time we had no idea that things come out randomly...    so we ended up waiting to eat for the next plate.    Once we found out about the food timing...   we were alright to order food in a family style way.    SOoooooo   much better.      

Let me just say...     sometimes its all about the service...   last time we had no idea what to expect with food timing and the really a la carte menu (Extra $ for salsa and so on)    This time the guy who served us gave us the info...  not only that, but he also knew so much about the ingredients and so friendly.    It really makes a difference.  

 I took my wife this time along with my In Laws all the way from Australia who really havent eaten too much Mexican food....   They LOVED IT...    Father in Law  "I want to lick the plate".     I think that was a resounding and solid Thumbs up. 

So lets talk about what was on the plate.    Guacamole with bacon....    Holy baby god!!!!!!    Soooooooo   Good!

Baja fish Tacos....    Ok...   Let me just say that I have been looking for a good fish taco since my favorite from a place I want to in Tampa years ago...      Listen....     Hands down the ones here at Mercadito were The Best!   Careful though...  they do have a real bite to them...      Spicy...  I love spicy but if you are sensitive...  Look Out.   

Listen...   We got 3 different types of Tacos to share with the table (share with the table...   Sharing is caring) and I could tell you what I liked...   But im not going to...   I liked it all...  and where thats concerned...   you will have your favorites...   Mine are the fish tacos....     Man I wish I was still hungry...     I'd go back for more.  

We also ended with dessert...  chocolate cake and flan...    I know it seems weird from me to have such a turn around, but I can't stress enough how much better this visit was.  Everyone loved it..   Wife...   In-Laws....   everyone  

I'm looking forward to coming back.

FYI     Our servers name i believe was Bryant...    Nice work man....   Really Nice work. I was there buying a shoe for my wife and a young blonde girl named Veronica helped me. She was the sweetest thing she was very kind and gave me a lot of advice on what to buy and that is great since I really don't have any experience buying woman shoes. Workers like Veronica are a god send for a store like that so helpful and patient with customers like me that no nothing about those shoes but want to get perfect shoes for their lady.. Try to sit outside next to the waterfall/pond thing they have, as there are a handful of water shows that happen about every 15 minutes.  None of the shows are that great, but it breaks up the meal, it's a great setting, and the meal was amazing.  I took my (now) wife there for her birthday, and I arranged for their pastry chef to make a cake for her.  Apparently, their pastry chef won some national cake-making competition.  The one she made for us looked like a present with a bow on it!  Pretty amazing stuff.  

Steaks and the service were very good, but the outdoor setting is what sets this apart.. One word. Excellent! My wife and I are picky about quality and selection. This is one of our go to places for breakfast!. Famous Ray's Pizza-Surprise...
Damn if they didn't out do themselves. I had a SPECIALTY PIE request. One I personally built ( my own creation) at one time. I didn't really expect them to comply with my request, but after a little discussion amongst themselves. I got my pie. I have got to say, "It was Delicious". Not too shabby either as far as price went for the kind of items I had them put on it. Better than some of the other local pizza restaurants. Needless to say I was a happy camper.
Thank You Ray's. I will be back.. Such healthy food, the cuisine is full of natural flavor and has probiotics to help the stomach. The curry is my favorite. I enjoyed every bite. The list of wine is better than most places in Phoenix. Thx. First time in. Carne Asada Tacos were full of flavor and so was the Ahogado Torta. Definitely a repeat place eat at.. Great place for beers and friends on weekdays. Enjoy bands on the weekends. Good selection of beers.. Very impressive shooting range.  Extremely personable and knowledgeable employees.  Good products, and good membership opportunities.  Exactly what we needed in this part of the Valley.  As demonstrated by everyone's review - you'll be glad you visited C2.. I'm not gonna lie, but this is seriously one of Phoenix's best kept secrets. I'm Native American so I grew up on frybread and I was floored when I found out a whole restaurant was devoted to celebrating it. Also, it's Tohono O'odham owned and operated so that gets huge points in my book. I really don't think I could stand the idea of a "fry bread house" being run by anyone but Natives. The beef stew and hominy are choice, and all come with fry bread. This place may very well be a future heart attack coming on, but I'll die with a smile on my face.. One of the very few things I truly miss about Pittsburgh.  This station is truly a gem.  Thank you WYEP for the live stream so I can still listen.   Have to admit it makes me a little homesick when I do.. Had never been here a was pretty stoked to get my chance. I had heard amazing things and definitely did not disappoint. 

The bellagio is the nicest and most expensive hotel I have stayed at in Vegas. The Friday they Sunday cost me $800 but with the resort fees and etc it was over $1100. A little pricey for a weekend in July but I knew it was 5 stars and my gf is worth it. 

The rooms are immaculate and the sheets, pillows and beds are plush. The eoom was cleaned very day perfectly and the staff was nice. The check in did take a few more than I am used to but it was Friday afternoon so it was busy. 

I would definitely stay here agin but maybe have to look for a special rate. We did not gamble here as the tables were very high minimums.. Think of how much fun you have at Disneyland and think of it in food form. That's this place.. This is my favorite downtown lunch slice. 
And I seem to be alone on that (the place is never crowded).. This is not a fancy place, but the cheaply priced and quality food will keep you coming back. Fantastic California burrito (with fries) makes it worth the trip.. There is much to like about Taqueria Guadalajara 2.0: the service is efficient, the menu extensive and you get incredible bang for the buck.  I like but not love the food; there are sub-par elements of any meal juxtaposed against some near transcendent elements.  While not my favorite Mexican restaurant in town, it is certainly in the conversation.

The Parrillada that my table ordered during my last visit to Taqueria Guadalajara exemplifies uneven performance of the kitchen.  This dish for four consists of various Mexican grilled meats, roasted potatoes, knob onions, deep-fried jalapeños and grilled cactus.  The steak and rib meat was superb, with a char on the exterior but not overcooked. The same goes for the slightly sweet knob onions, which helped balance out the pile of unctuous grilled meat.  And the oh-so-wonderful corn tortillas served on the side were thick, fresh and loaded with flavor.  On the flip side, the overcooked chorizo added a crunchy element the dish did not need.  The potatoes could provide that textural component if properly prepared, but instead, the limp, under-seasoned spuds seemed out of place, considering the generous pile of starchy Mexican rice served on the side.

The same study in contrasts occurs with the complimentary chips and salsa.  The bland, slightly stale tri-color chips seem out of place in a restaurant that serves such wonderfully fresh corn tortillas.  Taqueria Guadalajara serves two salsas with the chips.  The flavor-packed spicy version is expertly prepared while its milder sibling is a watery mess.

Once you get past the uneven performance of the kitchen, the performance of the restaurant shines.   

The expansive menu offers a vast variety of choices, including numerous vegetarian options.  Adventurous eaters can dine on pig stomachs or beef intestines while the kid's menu gives you the ability to feed the bambinos when you elect to bring them along.  On weekends, the restaurant offers pozole and menudo.  The generous serving sizes mean you will be toting a doggy bag when departing the restaurant.

I have enjoyed top-notch treatment during my visits.  While not overly gregarious, the servers are cordial and efficient.  Even when slammed with customers, I always receive water and complimentary chips and salsa within a couple minutes of being seated.  Also appreciated is how the servers keep a keen eye on the chip basket.  When the chip level starts running low, the server will promptly ask if the table if they want a refill.   They also consistently perform other service basics liking checking in after they deliver the food and promptly removing dirty dishes.  

For a mom-&-pop Mexican restaurant,  Taqueria Guadalajara gets a gold star for cleanliness.  The stainless steel open kitchen still gleans as it did when the restaurant reopened and the tabletops are always spotless.

The serving area is relatively small and there is scant space between the tables.  Eating during peak hours means it may be difficult to carry on a discussion with tablemates at conversational tones.  The dining room has the obligatory muted flat screen tuned to a Liga MX match or other Latin programming.

 Pro tip:  When perusing past reviews, be aware that a completely remodeled Taqueria Guadalajara reopened on August 8, 2013 after a fire closed the restaurant for over six months.  You should discount any comments about the gritty nature of the eatery before that date.

So if you find yourself travelling the South Park Street corridor with a heavy appetite and a light wallet, do not hesitate to pay Taqueria Guadalajara a visit.. The vegan wings are amazing! And that vegan Pittsburgh sandwich is just like I remember the ones from youth before I was vegan. I just wish they had more dine in room, but I've never really had trouble finding a seat. One of these days I'm gonna try that pizza with the vegan cheese if I can keep myself from ordering the wings and sandwich.. I typically head to Pro's Ranch Market (PRM) a few times a month. The place is huge. There are several speciality departments (bakery, tortillas, fish, meat etc). PRM has great prices throughout the store. I typically go there for the produce. I have noticed that you need to eat/use your produce within a few days or the items may go bad. Produce doesn't have quite the shelf life that you may get at Frys, Safeway etc because the fruits especially need a little more time to ripen up.

Each time I go to pick up food items, I have to make sure to hit the taqueria. I'ver never been disappointed with a meal there.  The al pastor is excellent. Getting a fruit drink or a bottled coke is a must. There are several options to go with for the fruit flavored drink.

When Ranch Market first opened up at this location, they provided free chips and guac at the salsa bar. Sadly, this is no longer happening. The salsa bar is still there, minus the chips and guac. I enjoyed topping of my tacos with the guac and having a few chips to go with my meal.

The homemade tortillas are awesome!

The staff is very friendly and helpful.

Always have several checkout lanes open. You shouldn't have to wait in line for more than a few minutes or behind 2-3 other customers.

The market, taqeria and parking lot can get very crowded.. You have a name here when you order, not a number! Great service, great food. So many combinations of burgers to try!  Dont forget to add the onion rings and a red cream soda or lemonade for the win!. At $20 bucks a ticket, I was hesitant to go in but was happy I did. A lot of information that my wife and I both enjoyed we spent over 3 hours inside and definitely had our fill by the time we got to the last few rooms. You should see it once, but once is enough.. Best scones and urban scramble breakfast!! Love this place!  I eat breakfast here everyday!. First time visitor.  Just arrived to montreal with my wife from toronto.  We've been looking forward to the food here for quite some time.  

We were incredibly impressed with everything tonight.  

The atmosphere is excellent.  The portions are generous and more importantly tasty.  We really appreciated the mid meal lemon sorbet to cleanse the pallet and the minty dark chocolate at the end of the meal. 

The steak was a bit on the garlicky side but we agreed to the extra topping.  Will definitely be coming back!. The pizza is exceptional here.

I had a chance to try the artichoke + chicken & pepperoni + sausage pizza, and both were exceptional (I'm not even a fan of pepperoni but they nailed it on this one).  The artichoke pizza is a must.  The prices are reasonable too.

Tips:
-Open till 2AM.
- You can order special sauce w/ your pizza but I wouldn't recommend it.  The sauce is a bit too sweet; it actually drowns out the flavor of your toppings and makes everything taste the same.. Went with family of four.  All went as expected and the outside dining is beautiful.  Lobster roll was better than expected as was service.  Family does not agree with me, but they are wrong. :). I LOVE THIS PLACE !!!! I work right next door and can not stop eating their delicious food. The food is amazing and the service is great. I have eaten Greek food for years and I have to say this place is hands down the best I have had. The Gyro meat is juicy and thick, the salads are large and fresh, and the pricing is pretty good considering the quality of the food the serve. No joke, I think I have eaten at the place everyday for a month and I will admit I frequently stop by to pick up food from them in the drive thru on the way home.. I love beer. Therefore I love beer fests. Never really been to one before but my girl dragged me to this one. Wasn't sure what to expect, but definitely had a great time. We sampled some great brews and I'm interested in finding some more local brews to try that I don't normally get to. I liked that it wasn't too crowded or uncomfortable and there was plenty of shade and seats around.. Great food for lunch and dinner. Everything I have ordered has been excellent. Have purchased several pieces here and have been very pleased.  Their prices are fantastic.  And the quality is second to none.  Ask for Mordechai!!!. Mia Kosher Bakery is new and I walked in at around 7:00pm on January 4, 2015 and they have an awesome bakery selection.  Their turnovers, kosher baked good delicacies and Sambusak (Calzone's) are fabulous.  I can't wait to try their Malawach Wrap, Burekas and many of their other sandwiches.  Their baked goods are excellent.  Wonderful warm greeting, great people and EXCELLENT baked goods.  Can't wait to go back and try their other sandwiches and salads  They have a Sabich Sandwich with Roasted Eggplant, Hardboiled Egg, Tomato and Pickle that is calling my name.  If you live anywhere near Lake Mead and Rampart, stop in.  They are next to the Smith's food store.  I will review again after my next visit for the Sabich!. Hello Maine! 

Er, wait. That's not how the opening to that show goes... but it's how it feels when walking into G&B. Definitely not what I pictured it to look like, but in a very good way.

+ Big, open space. Bright. Lots of white-washed walls, exposed duct work, tile work, and natural wood ceiling. 
+ Huge bar area with plenty of good seating
+ Even though it's a big, open space with hard surfaces, it's not super noisy. It could've been an unbearably loud space, but I suspect they have done some things to help manage ambient noise
+ Several strategically placed televisions for watching the game/sports center

+ Decent tap list; albeit a bit small (maybe 6-7 taps?); great pricing
+ Nice bottle list
+ Small mixed drink list, but drinks were tasty and well made
+ Bartenders were efficient and good
- Not super personable, but not aloof by any means

+ Menu is heavily seafood-based
+ Pizzas looked amazing (didn't sample any)
- Prices are a tad high, but not unreasonable

I can't wait to return to here and sample more of the food. I'd strongly suggest sitting at the bar if possible - just felt "right.". Yay! I'm a fan of @PeppermillVegas .  Cool local flavor up in this joint.

This is a great example of local flavor as well as what happens when you take a diner and rub some funk on it.

I recommend the pastrami burger, although it is a 1/2 pound of beef, a little more than I go for but it was delicious and I will likely return for another go 'round when I'm in Vegas again.

The service was very good...almost too good, but not quite.. Just my style.  O.H. brings a breath of fresh air to the stale, old school style of Caesar's Palace and the strip.  Hip, swanky, with a definite touch of class, my lady and I were most satisfied for our date night out on the town.

Let's start with the drink list.  My girl had a tough time choosing between the many options of Martinis, and settled on something very fruity (surprise surprise) but delicious.  I went with a basic Chard as that is the type of night I was in the mood for.

From there we started with the apps.  We decided to go with Shrimp Cocktail and the Kobe Beef Meatball.  The Shrimp Cocktail was resembled NOTHING of the word shrimp.  These things were HUGE and amazingly delicious.  When we laid our eyes on the Kobe Beef Meatball, we soon figured out that it was going to be a night where we were seriously going to eat.  Again, the meatball did not disappoint as the marinara blanketing the pan went perfect with a fork full bite. 

Already feeling our stomachs starting to stretch, we decided to share the bone in Rib Eye with potato dumplings and tater tots.  All were off of the hook.  The steak, cooked to perfection, medium soft pink and tender as hell.  The potato dumplings and tater tots (something out of the norm for us) were an added treat to meal.  We caught ourselves gasping for air to fight for room in our tummies while sneaking another bite of a tot.

Top button already blown, you know we had to go with desert!  The GF swears that the ice Cream covered cookie was the best ice cream that she has ever had in her life. 

100% we would recommend the Old Homestead to anyone that  wants a nice night out on the town.  Pricey?  Indeed, but worth every cent.  I can't wait to get back to try the seafood platter app, and my girl keeps on hinting on when our next "date night out," will be so she can get back to that ice cream.. Our first time here. They did an excellent job for our party of four at dinner. Wonderful service, generous wine and drink pours. Each of our various entries were perfectly prepared. Prices are reasonable.

We ate "outside" and enjoyed the fabulous fountain. The inside looked nicely decorated. 

We used to live in the area and frequented the Forum Shops. This is a nice addition to the shops.

Tourists do not be afraid! This is a great place wether you are a local or just visiting.. Had these guys come yesterday to clean our Living Room, stairs and hallway. Guy was on time, nice, did a good job, price was what my wife was told on the phone. Nice job - even dried in a few hours like they said. Stairs took a bit longer, but they get little air circulation. Would definitely use again.. WayLay design does a fantastic job.  They designed my website, working with me every step of the way, offering great suggestions, and making sure that the finished product was exactly what I wanted.  I guess the best part was that they were so easy to work with, responding promptly and completely to every question and suggestion I had. After the website was completed,  they continued helping me out, making sure that everything was just right and the manual they gave us was very inclusive and easy to understand.  They are great people!  You can't go wrong by contacting them and learning more about what they can offer.  I was glad I did.. I have always loved this small chain.  Jesse Browns is a staple to the Charlotte area, and they were in the area a LONG time before REI was.  However the selection can be a little bit lacking.  But they have their advantages. The major advantage is their map selection... sure they have the National Geographic maps like REI has, but they also have harder to find maps of the Carolinas that can typically help you more with your back country camping than the Nat-Geo maps do. 
Another advantage they have is that they carry fly fishing supplies.  Not the cheap stuff either, this is good quality rods, reels, and flies.  Definitely a place for anyone who loves to fly fish to check out.  
Finally they always seem to have a sale going on at any given time, and typically they have a few items you don't see anywhere else, which makes it a little bit more special. 
This truly is a great store and a must visit for the outdoor enthusiast.. It is a park. It is in the extreme Northwest. There is a baseball diamond. 

These facts alone warrant a 4-star. 

The fact is that human beings should not be permitted to settle this far in the valley (certainly not outside of the beltway loop), so there should be no park up here. But there is. Unfortunately, they are even adolescents -- with no lives -- who enjoy hanging out here late night. (Yes, I am that grouchy old man.)  

Its existence is a mixture of miracle that they would even bother providing public parks this far away the city centre, and, supporting evidence of appalling, unrelenting, suburban flight. 

The sprawl is real. Nature has no hope against the parasitic cancer known as man. Poor Rango. - E. I have been getting my cuts here for almost a year, once a week. Sergio does a great job at cutting my hair, they also give you free complintry drinks while you wait, and will give you a free neck massage after every cut. I would never go elsewhere to get a haircut.. I love my wet and sloppy ribs!. I stopped here on a whim when I saw they had some happy hour-ish bar specials.  A signature cocktail and an app for about 15 bucks wasn't bad for vegas.  The mini lobster rolls were very tasty (but a bit lemony).  The presentation was very nice, and so was the service.

As with most on the Vegas Strip the restaurant was beautiful!. Not a very good DIY person and it was 100% worth the time and drive from Surprise! Super helpful, tested my AC motor when it wasn't that, got me the part that I needed, showed me how to rewire it, explained it and very helpful. A call to an AC company is minimum $150 service fee? This cost me $13 total. Hope I don't have more problems but this is where I will go and will recommend to friends!. This place has the best and most reasonably priced BBQ in Vegas! They also have a great weekly Saturday comedy show at 7:30 pm!!!. This is a fantastic property. It has that as true Wisconsin charm that I love.The management and staff are always friendly and helpful.. The hotel is very warm and always well maintained. It has a very distinct personality which separates it from all those generic brand hotel chains..I have referred numerous associates to the Ruby Marie and would recommend this to anyone else visiting the Madison area.. Very small hole in the wall family owned Pho place.  As a huge pho eater, I have to say this is one of the best Pho places in Phoenix. Price wise, it is very inexpensive. The broth is chicken so it tastes a bit sweeter than most pho broth, but nevertheless its very well made.  I didn't taste any MSG in my broth like some of the other pho restaurants I have been to.  Their goi cuon and bi cuon is has less noodles in it which is exactly how I like mine made.  Their macaroon is a huge hit.  It is super fresh and it runs out pretty quickly.  

My only complaint is this place isn't closer to where I live.

I been looking for an authentic pho restaurant ever since moving to Phoenix from Dallas a year ago... and it looks like I might have found it.. Is there space for another coffee and sandwich shop in the bulging Edinburgh market? Cafe Milk appears to squeeze in quite nicely! we went here for a coffee and sandwich on a cold Sunday last weekend and were pleasantly surprised. The decor is very minimal, white glazed wall tiles and tables and benches give the place an austere post-war school feel, but it works well. The food was very nice - crisp, fresh wraps and hearty soups.

I would have happily rated Milk a 5 star effort but for the smallish latte size and amount of space at the table.  On a busy day you're going to feel a little cramped. The guy who served us was cheerful without being OTT. All in all well worth a visit.. This place is awesome!!!! The guys made us feel at home this is def our new sushi place!!! Yoshi, Nick and Donald thanx for making our 1st time many more to come. I'm born and raised in NY. I'm a Yankees fan. I used to live 2 blocks from Fenway Park. I used to live 2 blocks from Wrigley Field. PNC Park is currently my favorite MLB ballpark. The location is incredible. Right on the river. Catching the crowds on the 6th Street Bridge before and after the game is a sight to see. Before coming here, my favorite seats were located behind home plate at the new Busch Stadium in St. Louis. I had grabbed these cheap seats in the top section behind home plate and the view is just astounding: the whole ballpark, the 6th Street Bridge, the water, and the Pittsburgh skyline. I had a great time. Great fans. Great food (Primanti Bros). The quest for the best view in a MLB ballpark ends here. (I must add a personal favorite moment: I was sitting in front of some season ticket-holders who kept calling out random numbers. I finally caught on and started laughing hysterically. They were keeping score: how many runs the Pirates scored to how many boats were passing under the 6th Street Bridge. I asked them who often won. The reply: "Not the Pirates, that's for sure."). Visited North for the first time on 03/26/14.  My wife works nearby, and I wanted to take her to lunch.  She suggested North because I like Italian food so much.  I can't wait to return to try other dishes!

North has done the impossible.  They got me to eat zucchini and like it.  I always swore that zucchini was not fit for human consumption.  They proved me wrong!  We started out w/ an order of the "Zucca Chips", deliciously thin sliced deep fried zucchini.  

Do to it being my first time there, we decided to split 2 lunches.  We started w/ the Italian Farm salad.  Mixed greens, salami, cheese, roasted red peppers. olives, and  red onion.  I don't like raw onion in a salad, but I ate every morsel in my salad.  They tasted like they were marinated and did not have that sharp onion bite.  

The other item we had was the Meatball Sandwich.  This was different than most restaurants, as it was served on a round roll, rather than a hoagie style roll.  The meatballs were very good and tasted like they had Italian sausage in the mixture; they were nicely complemented by the cheese, sauce, and tasty roll.  Accompanying the sandwich were some of the best potatoes that I have ever had in a restaurant.  They looked like they were par boiled whole, smashed and fried.  Very, very good, nice texture, and a great taste.  The nice thing is that they were not greasy looking or tasting, nor were they salted to death.

I have to mention that the service was very good.  The hostess, our server, and another server that was assisting ours were great.  They smiled and were welcoming and friendly.  No bad attitude whatsoever.  We told the server we were splitting the meals, and he had the kitchen split them so we didn't have to (nice touch!).  

I have nothing negative to say about our visit to North.  The only detraction that I could mention would be the noise level; it was loud when the place started filing up.

Our bill was $36 before tip.  A little high for a midweek lunch, but not high when considering the quality of the food we had.  I usually don't say this about restaurants that are "new" to me, but I can't wait to return!.. Best.  Restaurant.  In.  Las.  Vegas.

Seriously, Encore and Wynn host the BEST restaurants in all of Sin City, and as I have eaten at all of them, I can honestly say Botero stands alone.

The ambience is beautiful, and gives a great vibe to the space, lighting is superb, and allows an intimate feeling in a room where there are plenty of things to feast your gaze upon.

However once your food arrives, good luck looking up from the table.  Steak was prepared to perfection... sides were delectable, and desserts were both original and delicious, giving you a sample of something a little different than what you come to expect from the Vegas steakhouse.

You can tell chef Mark LoRusso has the ability to balance standard favorites with new age flare to create a memorable meal.

If you eat one place the next time you're in Vegas, make it Botero.. I really need to be kicked in the backside because it's taken me so long to try this place.  Went to NoDa Brewery about 10 times but never stopped at Birdsong (even though it's next door) because I thought they only had jalapeno flavored beer, i.e. thought they were a 1-trick pony.  

But no, no, no - they have a very nice selection.  And every pint is $4 - yeah!  The Higher Ground IPA comes in at a respectable 7% ABV and was perfect to imbibe on a pleasant summer sunny day.  Before I knew it, I had three sixteen ounce pints (plus a taster).  Good thing my wife was driving.  

My bro-in-law dug the Lazy Bird brown ale.  Before he knew it, he had four pints.  Good thing his wife was driving.  I'm not usually into brown ales but it was tasty.  And they had a special release light summer beer (not as much alcohol) that has done well enough to earn a permanent spot.  

The bartenders are super nice.  And the clientele just seems really laid back and some dudes were inside playing some 1970's war board game.  We liked it so much that we went Saturday and Sunday.  Took our Asheville friends here and the Beer City residents gave it two thumbs up.  Beer cred!

And did I mention that they have peanuts as a snack?  Nice.  And thank you to the wives for staying sober when the husbands just couldn't say no to one more!. I have mixed feelings about Marquee...

Very popular nightclub with a good crowd and great EDM music (as well as a hip hop/top 40 area too). The legit DJs however make it so that guys have to pay a significant amount of moneys to get in w/o hook-ups - $50 ticket cover for my guy friends in our group. But Krewella was amazing. Probably one of the best dance seshes that night. THE LAZERSSS! We were also right up against the DJ, not too hard to get up there before midnight which is cool, well aside from the crazy amount of stairs there are...

Drinks were quite intense - $80 for a round I paid for about 5 drinks...given they are legit, but $15 for a red bull vodka? Oi...also, security guards were quite unforgiving...One girl in our party was making a phone call to the bf in the stall, and when we noticed she was gone, she was kicked out of the building - no, no, not the club...the Cosmo...WUT. Apparently they thought she was doing some illicit activity because she took too long and never gave her side of the story a chance. :(  Well, being the good friends we were, we decided to keep her company that night instead of returning to the club.

Tips before coming back: get hook-ups, can buy tix the night of for less ($20 off!), pre-party for sure, don't take too long in the bathroom when security guards are outside. This is by far the best Canadian restaurant I've had the pleasure to dine at, and I'm amazed how little it is known in Montreal.

The restaurant itself stands out from others with its big, clear windows. The entire dining place is lit with several lightbulbs attached directly to extension cables hanging on the ceiling, and the ambience is slightly more "hipster" and casual.

The tables are in different sizes and shapes, and I was seated at a table that was very wide in width but pretty narrow in length, and for my table most of the dishes were presented in long, rectangular plates. The same dish, however, ordered by another table of 2 beside me was presented in a round, large plate because they had more table space. The plating, of course, was also slightly different.
It amazes me how much thought process they invested for creating such magnificent dining experience for every individual.

The service was quick, efficient and personal, and there is nothing much to talk about. It is possible to make and modify your reservation online via Guestful, and it is very fast and convenient.

The food was savoury at every bite. Pastaga's dishes were, in my opinion, about the harmony of flavours and textures. Every element on the plate has its own purpose, whether it was the acidity from pickled eggplant to balance the sweetness of the caramel sauce, or the texture of the soft pancake to contrast the crispiness of the piglet skin, everything just works so well...together!

From the interior decor to the presentation of the dishes, everything seemed so simple, and yet so elegant and complex. Chef Juneau has showed me that simplicity is indeed the new complexity.. Free wifi, short security lanes, and clean. 

-1 star for not having many electrical outlets in Terminal D.. Great Experience! Overall, the best homemade pastas I've ever had. The best deal was at happy hour, but the portions are over twice as big for dinner. My wife and I had homemade Gnocchi, and homemade ravioli. Both were literally excellent. Fresh, light, delicate, and so flavorful. The bartender, Jimmy, was a real treat as well. Super great service and excellent food will keep us coming back for more.. I absolutely love this bar.  If you want to feel like a regular, even when you're not, come here.  They'll get your name and use it - a friendly hello and goodbye.  All with a genuine smile.

It's not what you'd expect from an iconic dive like this - but that's exactly why I come here.  Oh - and the burgers are damn good.

Come here on a Sunday for a hangover cure and football on tv.. Couldn't agree more.  Some of the best Za I've had in Charlotte.  I always get 2 slices of sausage mushroom.  Killer.. I have been to Vegas many times but finally stumbled upon Tender quite by accident. Admittedly, I am always somewhat skeptical of places such as this because I have been disappointed before- NOT the case here.

First off the ambiance and staff are phenomenal, despite being connected to a casino. The waiting staff is well versed on all of their options as well as proper items to accompany with. I tried many things and not one was below par in the slightest, but the star of the show (surprisingly enough) was a burger...

Definitely not any normal burger though, I wont ruin any secrets but all of the ingredients of the "surf, turf, and air" burger are of the highest quality and it can be tasted. Without a doubt the best meal I have ever had anywhere.. A super collection of very eclectic and unique jewelry, trinkets, glassware, scarves and all sorts. If you're looking for a gift and been through all the usual places and not found anything that lights you up.

I thought the beer bottle tumblers were really cool, but I ended up with a set of unusual fridge magnets.. I've been eating here for years, since it was Sonora Brewery.  I've always loved the food, the beer, and the service.  I moved out of state a year ago, came back for business this week and HAD to have the yummy Kobe Burger.  And I'm pleased to say, they didn't let me down.  It was cooked perfectly, and the sweet potato fries appetizer was a great way to start the meal.  Vanilla porter, delicious!  And here's the kicker:  after not setting foot in the place for almost a full year, my server knew not only how I wanted my burger, but also remembered what kind of dressing I liked on the side to dip my fries in!  THAT'S personalized service!  Five stars, SunUp...You deserve 'em!. Awesomeness! So smart but It's a bit confusing for a fist timer. Them muffins are great wish they put more sandwiches and breakfasts on them. The place is so rules free I hope people do not take advantage because they give the customer the benefit of the doubt.
    Pizza was nice, love to have tried the sweets but as it was January I was already way over my careful calorie count. The rockin tunes added so much though I am sure the format appeals to mostly a younger crowd. 
   Some Details, Counter Service until 4. Pizza day time only weekends. Sandwiches are picked up at a different counter than, pizza and burgers. There is a white bucket for your dishes.. I grew up with Mexican food, with a father who grew up in Southern California.  While I'm no snob, I'm sick of the faux-mexican restaurants in this area and what they pass off.
Well, La Unica is a breath of fresh air!  My 2nd favorite mexican restaurant, and IMHO the 2nd most authentic in the Charlotte area I've tried.  Anything on the menu is good, the servers are friendly and attentive, and the prices are fair.
The one complaint I would have is crowd control.  They're almost always busy, you almost always have to wait, and the entrance is a mash of people waiting, leaving and paying - such that sometimes you can't catch their eye to get your name on the list because they just don't know if you're coming or going.
But it's worth the wait to have real mexican!. Went here due to the fact that one of their cupcakes won on "Cupcake Wars". I'll let you research which one it is but I can tell you it wasn't the best one they have there. It was probably my least favorite of the 6 that I ordered. The one that stood out the most was the banana cream cupcake and the peanut butter cupcake. Not the best cupcakes I've ever had but very good, and you won't be disappointed.. Thin and Saucey. Fresh and cold. No I'm not talking about Nicole Richie and Paris Hilton. It's the pizzas and salads at Sauce. I normally don't like the order here, sit down there kinda restaurants. But this place does it right. I'm not going to get into NY vs. Chicago vs. California vs. Tombstone. Save that for a thread, right? I love pizza. So I love them all. Depends on my mood. These pies are delightful. My fave is the sausage and caramelized onion. The potato pizza is hella good. Spinach salad with pine nuts and goat cheese...perfect with my sausage pizza. Service is cheap and the prices are friendly. There's plenty of atmosphere and the parking is light and airy. So get Sauced. Today!. i had a great time here with family. we went to see Alex Reymundo. the servers were awesome and the drinks were strong!. I will preface with one thing, I do not like the house made soda, it tastes gross
Otherwise, the food is soooo good
Things worth trying:
The turkey BLT, it is really good, and has lots of  turkey bacon
Slow boat to china, just yummy and fun
The greek flat bread, I order with extra olives and feta cheese, which is sooooo good
the sweet potato fries are greatt. Dietcoke chips salsa and guac yummy.  Food was cold.  well not cold but my cheese had hardened cause it was no longer hot.  and the waitress never came to check on us.  The manager was really nice and apologetic.  But it sucks on friday night to have a s... meal.. We just stopped in, our first visit since the remodel. Our food was prompt and very fresh, the wings were good and the place was as clean as could be. We were very happy with our service. Lots of sports on TV without a loud, draining experience like most sports bars.. I haven't been to Corleone's in almost a year, but I was thinking about sandwiches and remembered how much I liked Corleone's, so this review is a bit overdue. 

First time I went I remember thinking "Cheez Whiz on a sandwich?" but I was told to try it before I complained and I did. I used that same spiel on my mom when I took her and she frowned at Cheez Whiz being on her sandwich. Needless to say, we were both wrong. The Philly Cheese Steak at Corleone's is amazing. They also have really good fries and that's pretty much the only two things I've ever eaten there in spite of having been there probably a dozen times. Even if you're apprehensive, go and give it a try, you won't be disappointed.. This was all it was hyped to be. A friend from the area had given me the recommendation and I'm glad that I took him up on it. Just a great meal from the start and the service there was good. You have to realize that you don't order at your table -- so if you are seated at the bar you can order from a bar tender, but if you are at a table with your group, you will go up to the counter and order that way.

Food was excellent and plenty of folks were having bloody marys' or other beverages during lunch time on a Tuesday. I enjoyed it enough to go back a second time later in the trip.. Snowy day in Montreal walked in with a friend to get out of the cold and ended up staying over 4 hours.
It was in between lunch and dinner and we never knew they were actually closed in prep for the dinner crowd.
The wine kept coming and the cheese plates and smoked meats kept showing up at the table along with items the chef in the open kitchen was preparing.

The staff was very friendly and we felt at home. The Blues music was the right touch to fill the space with energy.

We canceled our dinner reservation at another location and never regretted it. Spending the afternoon and evening with a staff and hostess that felt like old friends.
It was a find and a great was to watch the city unfold out the over sized windows.. Highly recommend using Jason and his guys. We didn't have a huge amount of stuff to move, but they were very professional and did the job quickly. I plan on using them again when we need to move.. My first visit at My Big Fat Greek Restaurant was mostly a pleasant one.

For starters my fiance and I both loved the appetizers. The bruschetta was some of the best I have had, because personally I love the soft bread they use. I don't like the crunchy hard bruschetta bread that other places use. Here the bread is soft and delicious. We also had the calamari and were pleased with it.

We ordered the gyro platter and were mostly happy with it, but we didn't like that they hardly give you any pieces of pita bread. We didn't mention it, but the waitress ended up asking if we wanted more pita bread anyways. We said yes and ended up getting charged an extra dollar, which I wish they would have mentioned because I assumed when she asked that it was complimentary to go along with the dish.

Aside from that the service was pretty good. They served refills in pitchers which was interesting. The only food item I didn't like was the potatoes which came as a side to the gyro platter. They had a weird taste. We both enjoyed the desserts here though. The bill was also a bit more than what we had expected, but on the whole we were pleased with this restaurant mainly because of the excellent appetizers!. It's been 5 years since we moved to Phoenix, and visiting Different Pointe of View has been on my list of things to do since we arrived here.  On Saturday we finally made it, and I wish that we hadn't waited as long as we did.  This restaurant was fantastic, and far exceeded my expectations.  I am always skeptical of restaurants in this price point, especially when you assume that you may be just "paying for the view".  Not true at all.  The food at Different Pointe of View can stand up to the creativity and quality of any other high end restaurant in town.  I had the Port Cabernet Braised Kobe Short Rib: Fresh Sweet Corn Polenta, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Endamame & Blue Berry Balsamic Reduction as an appetizer.  It was delicious and unique, and my only complaint was that there was not more of it.  My wife had the lobster bisque with Heirloom Cauliflower & Lobster Timbale, it too was remarkable, but I was glad that I got the short rib.  For entrees I had the Cedar River Prime New York Strip: Pancetta Chervil Rosti Potato, Braised Artichoke Heart & Portabellas Sherry Caramelized Onion Reduction.  There was a lot going on in this dish, and I appreciated every bit of it.  The steak was perfect and the carmelized onion reduction was incredible.  My wife had the Palo Verde Farms Pork Tenderloin with Chorizo Stuffing: Piquillo Pepper Parmesan Risotto, Sweet Corn & Baby Zucchini Succotash, Caramelized Tree Ripened Peach & White Balsamic Olive Oil Emulsion.  This had a ton of flavor and she loved it.  The risotto was really my favorite part of the dish, but the pork was excellent.  We both had some standard desserts - i had creme brulee which was good, but nothing special, and she had the Chocolate Amandine: Milk Chocolate Mousse and Vanilla Amaretto Cream, which I wish that I had gotten.  We did not sit on the patio, but I cannot imagine a more beautiful place to eat, and I will certainly reserve my table well in advance on our next trip to make sure that we sit outside.  This place will not disappoint, and it is definitely NOT just about the view.. Not kid friendly, but very nice. Spend the extra and goto the four seasons if you have kida.. All around great experience. 

Friendly hosts and waitress. 

Menu has plenty of great options - burgers, fries, chicken, ahi...

Had the Ringer. Great burger. Everything about it was spot on - flavors were fantastic, meat like melted in my mouth, bacon was crispy and flavorful. 

Fries were crispy and nicely salted. Green chili cheese was a nice side. 

Cool ambiance. Price is as expected for a nice burger place.. The recent elite event at Verde reminded me, I'm definitely in need of a re-review of this place! Since our first encounter, I have taken my own advice several times and come here, treating it as a bar more than a restaurant, reveling in a variety of tequilas, and cocktails involving it. They bring around your first round of chips for free if you're at a table, and they're unlimited at the bar. Along with the chips, their appetizers are usually enough to split between two people over drinks, but they usually have a few items on special so you might want to enjoy a flatbread made with the freshest ingredients they could find that day.

Being one who enjoys to branch out as much as I can, I love to come in for their Agave Wednesdays, that is: a half-oz 'taste' of any tequila on their wall(that is usually priced under $18) for only $3! So, you can create your own flights of tequila to suit your tastes, or let the bartender know what you like and have them spin up their own. Be sure to ask for the iPad menu to get an interactive look at their selection, along with tasting notes and label texts. 

Their patio recently opened, which is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Service has also been greatly improved since the last view - now very attentive and friendly, if not still a bit scripted. The bartenders are all wonderful, very well versed in all of the tequilas and in making excellent cocktails.

If you're looking to grab a few drinks or get an education in tequila, and get some excellent modern mexican-inspired snacks(And maybe dinner, but I haven't tried in a while), Verde is probably the best place to stop. Be sure to heed the warning on the door about parking - if you park in the Glass Lofts lot, there is about a 110% chance of getting towed.

Also, Verde now serves brunch saturdays and sundays, which is delicious!. Okay...so, 11:30 on a Saturday morning MIGHT not have been the best time to come for breakfast. There were throngs of people in the dining room...yet we managed to walk right in and sit down.

Now, understandably, the service was SLIGHTLY delayed due to the sheer volume of people. But our waitress, Sandy, was consistent and pleasant. Even with all of the hustle and bustle, Sandy was able to keep all three of our drinks full.

Denny's has started to emphasize their "fit and healthy" menu. Now they shout out items that are high in protien, low in calories, low in fat, and high in fiber. My wife got the "Fit Slam", and I opted for the "Fit Omelet". Nutritious AND delicious!. Dogtown has been my groomer for four years. I have unique styles for my dogs, and they are always willing to accommodate. Quality takes time and the people at DogTown are all about quality. I am so grateful for their service and their prices. I also love supporting a local business. Loraine is epic.. Just stopped in for my first Firehouse Sub and I wasn't disappointed. I had the medium pastrami sandwich on white bread. The bread was fresh, a little crispy, and very tasty. The pastrami itself was cut thick and also had a great flavor. They have a hot sauce bar loaded with great, hard-to-find, hot sauces. The only complaint I have is that it does take a little while to get your sandwich, about 10-15 min. Now this certainly didn't ruin the experience for me and to be fair, they were getting slammed with orders. Overall, it is very easy to recommend this sub shop. I'll certainly be coming back...next time for a Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket!. The food is authentic vietnamese with reasonable price. This is not the inflated Vegas Strip prices with small portion. Come here if you are part of the Viet family looking for good cafe sua da and Pho.. I live nearby and had seen the little place a couple of times but wasn't really sure about it, but i gave it a try a sunday i was in the mood for chinese and i didn't regret it. I had the lunch buffet special and, even though they don't have a great variety to choose from like other buffets, the food really makes up for it, specially the orange chicken, i loved it! In fact i'm kind of addicted to it (and believe me, i don't usually say the "L" word that often). I really like going here cause the food is good, they price is very accessible and the staff is nice. If you don't mind a small place and want to have a good meal for a very good price, this is the place.. Zaw's is, hands down, the best Chinese food in Squirrel Hill. Everything I have ordered has always been fresh, hot, and most importantly, delicious.

But it's not just the good food that endears this place to me. The gentleman that runs this establishment is the nicest man I have ever met, and he sealed my loyalty on my second visit about a year ago.

I arrived to pick up my food, only to realize I was short about $5. My girlfriend volunteered to walk to a nearby ATM, while I stayed behind. After about 30 seconds, the owner picked up my order, held it out to me, and told me to take it and I could pay him back next time. This was only my second time in his restaurant, and he was trusting me to not just take the food and conveniently "forget" to pay him back.

So, good food and good people? Why would you go anywhere else?. My wife and I had dinner there last week , we had the Beef Wellington , and OMG awesome! Lives up to  it's hype ! We had asparagus and okra as sides. , the okra was as good as the Wellington, I can't wait to have that again , highly recommend the okra , we did the works with coffee and sticky toffee pudding, all amazing , it was a wonderful experience and will go next time in Vegas total bill close to 300. Just to warn you lol. The joys of Pho (pronounced "ph-uh") are fairly straightforward.  Take a tasty broth, add some expertly-sliced thin meat, scallions and rice noodles are offer the ingredients in a bowl.  Add some basil, bean sprouts and spicy peppers on the side (with an optional side of rooster sauce and other spicy, sweet and/or sour sauces).

Simple enough, but get the right bowl of pho and your view of the world drastically improves.  Call it stomach psychiatry--a really tasty bowl of pho can directly stimulate serotonin levels in the brain (more serotonin = more happy).  

But all of that just speaks to the genius that is pho.  Here's why you should head to Pho Kim Long for your pho fix.  When I was there, I ordered the rare steak and brisket pho.  The beef broth was well-prepared and pretty rich.  Other reviewers seem to have complained about the quality of the broth, but during my lunch there it was spot on.  It was a very solid offering.  The side veggies were crisp and fresh and delicious.  

And Pho Kim Long offers a well-stocked selection of sauces if you like to tinker with your food--making it spicier, sweeter, a dash of sour, etc.  It all made for the perfect pho lunch.  The other folks at my table had the beef vermicelli ("bun" in Vietnamese) and were very pleased, reporting that the bun was better than most.  All of which earns it about 3.5 stars (rounded up because of how popular the place seemed--gotta give some credence to the will of the people).

Good enough that Pho Kim Long has become a standard in my list of Vietnamese places in town.  And the crowd there at lunch suggests that this place has become a go to lunch destination in Chinatown.  It has a big dining space and every table was packed when we were there.  That might explain why service was a little slow when we were there.  But, to the wait staff's credit, they didn't seem to mind when we stepped over to the cashier without a bill in order to settle up.  

I haven't tried it late night, but the place is open 24 hrs so it might be worth a visit after a night out on the strip (put down the Jack in the Box, pick up the chopsticks).. Back at Mad Greek tonight. Food was awesome. Never better service anywhere.. This hotel deserves 4-stars (one step above a Marriott, but one step below a 4 Seasons) for its a) attentive but not invasive service, b) superb room layout, c) but slightly off-strip location. 

Stayed here for a week during New Years. The staff is attentive but not invasive. Service staff kept a professional, but light tone with me during check in. I noticed some subtle things: they really know how to treat their Asian guests. They weren't overt or abrasive about it (if they said Ni Hao I would have laughed) but they always handed me things with two hands; had crisp dollar bills whenever I asked for change; and somehow never intruded in my personal space, yet kept me happy the entire time I was there. No idea how they did that. Oh, and they employ house elves because I never once saw a housekeeping cart or staff, yet my bed was always made. Awesome. 

The room was excellent, with a fully stocked kitchen (you can call ahead and have it stocked with food if you'd like), large shower and jacuzzi tub (that can fit more than a couple of people inside), and large living space/king size bed/study area. This is the studio that I've been looking for to live in on a regular basis. We watched the fireworks in my room after the Strip got too crazy. I had a perfect view of the 8 minute fireworks show from my room; what a great way to ring in the new year. 

The slightly off-strip location is a bit annoying for me. The shuttle ends at midnight on weekdays and 2AM on Fridays and Saturdays. I usually tip shuttle drivers well and ask for their cell phone numbers so that I don't have to pay for taxis. That strategy didn't work for New Years since the traffic was so intense after the police closed the strip. On the other days, the shuttle is fine but they rotate the shuttle drivers a lot so its hard to maintain contact with any one particular driver. The shuttle drives you to Encore or to the back of the Forum Shops (where all the fancy shops are, in the back of Caesar's Palace). Its a long walk to any where you are going on the Strip. 

One other thing: you'll pay a $25 resort fee, but its worth it. You get free wireless access (really fast connection, about 1Mbps download) and access to fitness center. Their room service isn't too expensive either. I bought a couple of bottles of wine with me but there's a liquor store that has a decent selection nearby. 

Bottom line: if you enjoy a "nice" hotel that's slightly off the strip and away from the center of activity and action, you'll enjoy Trump. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.. Excellent customer service! The food was as I had expected, delicious! I ordered a medium and it was huge! I still have half of the pizza to eat tonight!! I will be back!!. These are the best, "mass produced" brownies I've ever tasted!  I am very impressed with how they keep the texture and moistness consistent across all of their different types and flavors of brownies.

Their store is really just a counter with a bunch of different brownies.  This isn't A place to go for dessert.  You show up, you try whatever samples they might have out and then you select which brownies they want.  Their focus really is on selling large quantities of brownies and their mail order business.. I had a horrible experience at another location. This location was amazing !!! I ordered with Paige and she made it so easy and was very professional! When I got here, Martin was quick to assist and informed me the promised time had not been reached yet and my pizza was still in the oven. They offered drinks at the bar to ease my remaining wait time. Joe and Kareem  was quick to grab me a drink and great conversation. My pizza and wings were delivered to me at the bar within the promised time. I will definitely be returning as much as I can. Great place and highly recommended!!. Try the Gyro! The ingredients are fresh and flavor is delicious! This gyro is on point!. Having dined at Wildcraft (another Charcoal Group establishment), I'd intended to head over to Martini's for a late-evening road-warrior soup-and-salad-at-the-bar.  Having just driven in from 5 hours away, I was wearing jeans - and the door to Martini's scared me off with its "PROPER ATTIRE REQUIRED" sign.

I'd seen a group of women standing outside of del Dente (wearing jeans) and figured I'd be safe there... even though the door was emblazoned with the same intimidating notice.  (There are three Charcoal Group restaurants in this compound - Charcoal Steakhouse, Martini's and del Dente)

Billed as "casual Italian," del Dente greets diners with a warm atmosphere (for what is essentially the basement underneath the other establishments).  Dark wood, fake vines, the whole thing.  The obligatory bread is served playfully in flowerpots - I found it both crusty and refreshingly soft.  A trio of flavoured (look, Mom, I'm localised!)  butters accompanies - tonight, the mortarboard consisted of roasted red pepper, herb and garlic, and cinnamon.  

The menu consisted mostly of pasta, salad, appetizers and pizza, with a single soup (apple & pumpkin?!?) and a short list of fish, poultry and meat-based entrees.  I had a small portion of the Limoncello shrimp pasta, which was served with a pesto.  The pasta is of good quality, and the shrimp was well-prepared.  I'm not sure if I got the Limoncello connection (as much as I love Limoncello!) but it's an interesting idea, anyhow.

The service was friendly - maybe a bit TOO friendly.  The server was trying to convince two female business travelers to join him for his birthday party at Milton's across the street after work.  The crowd was youth-biased and Kitchener cosmopolitan.

All-in-all, a fine place for a business meal on the road.  They even had Monday night football on (muted, of course, to further your enjoyment of the house music - and yes, I mean house like dancy trancy, not like house wine - that is the del Dente soundtrack) above the bar - where full dinner service is available.. WOW.
What an amazing place.

Since I am half Ukrainian, Ive wanted to try the Red Square for Years but have never been with anyone who would go with me.

Finally, Halloween night, my Fiance (Oh How I love her) was as excited as I was to try this place.

WHAT a great experience.

The food (although on the spendy side) was Exceptional. We had the Stroganoff (her favorite dish on earth) and the Shrimp dish. 

Afterwards, we went into the "Vodka Vault" and it was a BLAST. We tasted a flight of Russian Vodkas and were duely impressed.

I highly recommend this place. especially if you want something a little different and fun.. I'm glad to have watched this show before the show ended in the Venetian and at first I wasn't looking forward to watch this show but my friend was a huge fan of Phantom the Opera and I wasn't but since I made her watch that Monty Python show at the Wynn. LOL

The theater is a far walk from the hotel lobby right around the smokey casino so you can be tempted to gamble while walking through the slot machines which worked on me. :(  The theater is designed as an old 15th - 16th century stage that resembling the Phantom era which was pretty neat and romantic IMO and they had a huge chandelier above the middle of the audience, we all seen that before right? :o

Since the original Phantom of the opera show was 3 - 5 hours and that being in Vegas, the showtime had to be cut to 1.5 hours 1 1/2 Vegas time. The sound and lighting helped enhance the production. Acting was what you would expect in a London or New York production, and lastly the chandelier falling down on the audience was unexpected since your distracted on what's going on stage and around the theater but was a lot of fun. I even took my parents to watch Phantom of the Opera, my Mom loved it but my Dad unfortunately fell asleep and.blamed it.on the dim lighting and soft music. LOL But he's more into the casino but me I'm more into shows and nightlife. It's sad this show has now left the Venetian and I'm glad I had the opportunity to watch this show twice.

I like to now admit that I am a Phantom of the Opera fan but not a huge fan but I love their music and soft melodies and those are one of the reasons it's so romantic.. I've been coming here for decades. Literally since the mid 70s. 

The staff has always been friendly and courteous. The doctors are always informative and willing to answer any questions or concerns I might have.

I now live in Anaheim but was in town for my vacation. I made it a point to stop in and have my eyes examined while I was in Vegas.

I'll be continuing to visit these folks for years to come.. My friends call me a child, but I can't help but order a cheese enchilada. Add rice and beans and you have a mess of cheese greatness mixing it together like your mom tells you in not playing with your food. Add the table side guac, live music, and a view of the city and you create a Mexican food masterpiece.. What a great steakhouse and seafood! Bone on filet and sea bass was amazing. Also they offer a great seafood platter that is a must!!! And you should try their roasted Brussels sprouts! Highly recommend this restaurant. Shakes from heaven (The S'mores or Salted Caramel will ruin you for shakes anywhere else).  Sinfully indulgent burgers and apps.  Creativity and wit in every line on the menu, and genius in every bite.  It's hard not to make my review sound like an advertisement, but they really are that good.  

Not only does Burgatory have tons of signature burgers that taste divine, you can "Have it your way" and they'll custom assemble any combo you can dream up.  The prices are fair for gourmet burgers and shakes.  I particularly recommend any of the signature house fries, the Onion Rings, and the  "Bangkok Fries": massive juicy portabello mushroom strips, beer battered, and brought out stacked in a log cabin with a spicy dipping sauce.

My only complaint is it's so good, that despite the ample seating, there tends to be a wait.  Expect 20-40 minutes on a normal day, up to as much as 3 hours on a busy Saturday night.  Given how many other restaurants are within a few hundred feet, it's very telling that people will wait here for over an hour, rather than eat somewhere else.  That's what happens when you offer delicious, innovative food, with good service, and fair prices.  I hope more other restaurant owners take note and follow Burgatory's lead!. Went here last November and was really suprised at quality of food , service was quick and server was very attentive even though we had kids on tow. Special offers on food at certain times of the day , never seems to be packed but does get busy before and after theatre events next door to Omni centre at the Playhouse. Kids are more than welcome as well which is good as it's a really nice place to take them for a meal.. I have been to Squid Ink several times for lunch & I've always been ultra satisfied. The food is excellent, service remarkable, atmosphere perfect. Indoor/outdoor bar is great even in hotter temps is a fun place, craft beers & a Kobe burger to die for!. Took a few folks and Jesse was our server...food was good and the service was great.  Will come back.. I love this place. It's old school. It's relaxed. It's a great price. And it's a fun place to hang out. 
I've been getting my hair cut here for months. Zakk is awesome and does a great job. He's careful and very considerate of his clients.  He's a self proclaimed "beard genius" and he truthfully is. Lucky, the whole staff there is great!  
This is not a place where you want to come in, get buzzed, and get out. There are crappy places for that.  

If you want a good haircut, a perfect line, and old school straight edge shave with hot towels, in a place full of the scent of Clubman Hair Tonic, then come to Laz!. A gem of a neighborhood place, very small yet quaint. They offer quite a few "boutique" wines, such as Turley, Ken Wright, Pesquera, etc. Again not a huge selection, but boy what they carry is top notch!

I came in for a top rated South African Pinotage for a blind tasting I'll be attending next week. Most people at this tasting have a disdain for South African wines (like I used to until I tried some of their recent vintages). So this should be interesting.

The young lady behind the counter was pleasant and was quite knowledgeable about the wines they carry.

Not the cheapest wine prices out there, but you get what you pay for. 

If you're looking for some "hard to find" wines, then check out this place. I will definitely be returning!. I've always considered restaurant Foo Lam comparable to Chinatown, it's a bit out of the way, but at least you don't have to compete for parking. They have a pretty eclectic menu - as it has Thai and Vietnamese items on the menu. Not to cause any confusion, they have different chefs in the kitchen that specialize in the different cuisines. With live seafood tanks in the dining room as well as a bunch of tis showing different news stations in various Asian languages, the atmosphere is a bit unique. Restaurant Maison Foo Lam shares the same entrance as Sharky's Pool Bar, so fret, just follow your nose.. First time visit..Went with a group of 28 friends to celebrate Mexican Independence day. 
They gave us free sangria and tequila shots :)
Live mariachi band for entertainment.
The guacamole made at table side by Kendell is to die for. 
This is an excellent Mexican restaurant. 
The location (to the left of Sapphire's entrance) is a little weird, but not a problem.
Had great company, great food and drink. Would definitely go back again.
I asked the woman at the front desk if I could borrow her Mexican Sombrero for some pictures. When I went to return it she told me  to take it home :)). My fave spot! We love their buffet options. They cater to your needs and service was superb. I have yet to try their DOSA Buffet on Sundays. Maybe soon!. I have driven past this place a few times and had no idea what it was until I popped in  yesterday to check it out.  Comparing to say, Dave & Busters, it has about 30% of the games, but also has a bowling alley and billiards in addition to the food and full bar.  Sunday through Thursday they have free billiards until 7, so of course I took advantage of that with a bucket of beer.  The help was friendly, and the place is still relatively new so everything is clean (for the most part).  I don't think I would come back to pay full price for anything here, but if it's happy hour or a promotion I could swing it for sure.  It's only a couple of blocks from where I work so it's possible this will happen sooner than later.  I munched on the southwestern egg rolls and chicken quesidilla - both were ok but neither knocked my socks off.  Still, totally worth checking out if and when the price is right!. Went on a Saturday for lunch; great selection of seafood dishes -- crabs, shrimp, clams, fish, prepared in various ways.  Had a sushi section and selection was pretty good!  Would like to see more sashimi and tuna nigiri sushi.  I ate mostly sushi the entire time.  Mom & aunt liked the other prepared foods.  It was quite expensive when going on weekends.  Our server was attentive, filling my glass of iced tea and Mom & Aunt's cups with tea and coffee.  Will probably go back, but not on weekends.. Buffalo chicken sandwich was superb, service excellent. Wife loved her veggie pizza.. Excellent work on my suit pants and other pants. Cuff on one straight leg on the other, just as I asked for. Pricing was fair and the turnaround time was outstanding. They even called and texted to let me know my pants were done. Highly recommended!!!. Had carpet done in our new home several months ago, price here was about $1,000 less than the next lowest estimate. No surprise charges, no high pitch upsells, carpet looks great and installed in one day. giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the person scheduled to come measure was 2 hours late, and couldn't measure because the current homeowners had to leave (we were still waiting to close at this time) the missed measurement appointment caused me to guess the sq footage myself coming up short one entire room, we didn't have time to reschedule because we were moving in within a few days. Its an inconvenience having the downstairs bedroom with different carpet but its worth it for the great price we got.. This place is awesome!! The room is beautiful and clean! So far all of the staff have been extremely nice and not fake and very helpful. This is definitely our new place we will stay when we come to Vegas!!. Delicious first trip. The couple that owns it waited on us.  Each thing we ordered was full of flavor and we even got a free soup during our meal. The Lo-Mein was definitely more flavorful than many other restaurants in the area. 
We ordered egg foo-yong, sautéed beef with ginger sauce, chicken fried rice, and vegetable lo mein. I will add more upon my second visit.. I've always heard about how Metro Pizza is a Vegas institution and yet it seemed that no one I knew ever went there. I never went either, but mainly because I'm always afraid to try non-chain pizza places here.

Alas, recently, I was in the neighborhood, was hungry, AND had some money to blow. Perfect scenario to try something new, amirite? 

The decor of the place is akin to your stereotypical, 80s/90s family restaurant. With red and white cheesecloth table coverings and everything. It actually made the place feel really comfy to me. I sat at the bar and ordered garlic knots and an "individual sized" (more on why I put that in quotes in a minute) Triple Play pizza, which was basically a Chicago-style thin crust pizza. 

In spite of the fact I ordered garlic knots, they STILL brought out bread and butter while I was waiting. So it was already clear how generous they were here. The garlic knots were huge and they were delightful. I'm talkin' drink the sauce and lick your fingers good. A slight gripe is that they could have been baked just a teeny little bit softer, but beyond that they definitely have to be the best garlic knots I've had after the ones at Chicago Brewing Co. 

What they call an individual pizza could easily serve two, three if we're talking light eaters. It had a cracker like crust with plenty of crunch to the bite, and was topped with  a generous helping of well-seasoned patty-style sausage. I made it through slightly less than half of it before I had to take the rest to go. 

My waitress frequently stopped by to ask how everything was and was refilling my drink without me even asking. To top off the already exceptional service, she gave me the tuesday night special (25% off your meal between 5 and 9 pm) in spite of the fact that I came in at four. What I thought would have been at least a $20 bill if not a little more ended up only being $14! I decided to just go on ahead and give her the rest of it as a tip!

It's a shame I didn't discover this place for myself earlier. I really do feel like I've been missing out now. 

The Final Verdict

Pros:
Home-y, slightly retro ambiance.
Generous portions.
Above and beyond service
One of the best pizzas in Vegas.
Pizza cooks who are competent with Chicago-style pizzas. 

Cons:
Garlic Knots could have been softer. But this is minor.  

Return Factor: 10/10. They have a menu that's really worth exploring.. The best coffee in Pittsburgh.  Do it right and order an espresso or cappuccino.  Grab something from the connecting door to pastry happiness.  Then go and stand around one of the tall tables and just enjoy.  Take in the surroundings of a true coffee shop.. Simple system, very good food, great service, highly recommend.  Families, friends, lovers, single, it's a place for healthy and still tasty food.  When I am in LV next time, I'm stopping again.. Dear God in Heaven, there is a burrito here called "The Beast" that is, hands down, the best burrito I've ever eaten. I'm not kidding, WOW! Also, the quesadilla with chicken was pretty much the second greatest thing I've ever eaten. A little pricey? Sure.. Worth it? I'd say so.. Cracked Egg is one of my favorite breakfast spots in Vegas. I will say this, I really enjoy the food but for the most part the servers usually suck. Since I work in the restaurant industry, I usually understand why service might suck one day or whatnot but I've had pretty crappy service there several times.. Never had a bad meal here.  Always a great place to eat.  I wish they would bring back the jalapeño, sausage gravy.  That was delicious.. This a relaxing environment for a dentist's office. My dentist, Dr. Acampado is a great dentist. She is friendly and thorough. She takes time to make sure that all my needs are met. A good dentist is like air, you really don't realize how great it is until you don't have it. It's an overused analogy, but it's just soooo good.

The office is comfortably appointed, modern and sleek. I went to a very antiquated dentist office once. It's not re-assuring, unless you are Grandpa Simpson. 

The dental chairs here have back rollers in them, which for me is almost reason enough to go. Everything about Tranquil Dentistry seems cutting edge which makes me think their practices are the most current in dentistry.

On a side note, I wasn't referred here. I initially started going because I was able to book an appointment sooner than six months away.. Great service! people are real friendly.
Always have my drink filled 
Great music in background
Plenty of TV to watch games
Management looks like they are involved and helping. A lot to see in this store of craziness. The kids love it and makes for great souvenirs if u have people to buy for.. Chef Hiro is one of Henderson's and Las Vegas' Living Treasures.  There is plenty that has already been said by other reviewers so there's no need for me to repeat all of the wonderful praise that Tokyo Boys truly deserves.. Cool place.
Good Burgers.
Also on sundays you can bring your dog to mingle with others. Pretty cool.. I like it at Stratosphere. I definitely think that if you are on a budget, this is probably one of the best options for you. I really have to say for $50 to $70 per night, it really is very well worth it. It has tons of things to do within the building. 

+ Quick check in during the afternoon. The agent was very nice, helpful, gave me good advice, and I had a very pleasant experience. 
+ The buffet was surprising good. Not extremely extensive but just the right amount of food for me to feel very satisfied, happy, and full. The man in the front gave me a tip to use a certain coupon and I got All You Can Eat for the entire day for just $20!! (Make sure to look in your coupon book they give you when you check in, its the last coupon in the back of the book).
+ Included fitness center, which was exactly what I needed. Machines were a little old but they worked well. I loved having free weights as well. (At the Wynn, its $30 per day to use their fitness center- go figure!)
+ As a guest, I had unlimited free access to the top of the Stratosphere Tower, while everyone is charged $16 per visit! 
+ Beautiful 360 view of Las Vegas, mountains, etc. I loved it!
+ Starbucks in the lobby. 
+ Very accommodating staff in all parts of the hotel. 
+ Cool little arcade in the mall area. 
+Comfortable room, very basic. 

- Surprising, what I didn't like the most was that the bathroom products. They are made by a company called ECOFRESH Naturals. The claim to be natural but all the products are filled with tons of harmful and synthetic chemicals. All the products felt super cheap and were really drying on the skin.  

It seems like it is quite far from the other main hotels on the strip, but I am staying at the Wynn for the next 2 days so I do not mind. I will be closer then.. This hotel definitely doesn't deserve the 2 stars that it has.  The staff was friendly.  The room was clean and comfortable.  I would stay here again.. Head and shoulders above the dunkins and kremes of the donut world. I love placing my order and waiting among the regulars while they discuss current events. The breakfast sandwiches are killer too.. Do yourself a favor... Order the pastrami sandwich. I was torn between the brisket and pastrami sandwiches and on the advice of our waiter I went pastrami... No joke, best pastrami sandwich I've ever eaten! Every time I come back I will order the pastrami!!! Oh yeah, the beer is really good too... I went with the wobble, wobble, wobble IPA.. So glad this location opened up in North Phoenix. Always simple low price quality food at all their locations. 
Best tortillas in town so always have to get a burrito. Green Chili Burrito is my favorite with the green machaca a close 1A. Red tamales are awesome and the kids love the chocolate chimis . 
No frills place but everything is a winner whether you eat in or take out, if you don't go it is your lost.. Gosh, I love this place!

Whenever I stay at the Wynn/Encore and I want a delicious meal in a casual spot, this is where I go.  It's located right off of the main casino floor, serves food for early breakfast, brunch, lunch and late dinner.  The atmosphere is very upscale while remaining a casual spot (i.e. you can show up in shorts and tees and catch ESPN on the TVs scattered throughout the bar and dining room).

The menu is American classic by design, and on previous visits, I've ordered everything from fresh fruit and a three egg freestyle breakfast, to turkey clubs and filet mignon sliders.  They have a lot of selections for breakfast, sandwiches, burgers, salads and a wide variety of entree options for dinner.  Every dish I have ordered has been very, very good.  They use quality ingredients and give you good sized portions.  And the service has always been super friendly and helpful.

On my most recent visit, they replaced the filet mignon sliders with french dip sliders, so I ordered those.  O M G!  These are amazing.  The beef just melts in your mouth and the slider buns are perfectly toasted.  These are a DREAM!

If you're a dessert fan (like me) you will love the XXXL Chocolate cake (caution: it serves like 3 people) and the fresh, warm donuts!

Overall, if you're staying at the Wynn/Encore or just visiting the resort, definitely make this a stop.

Iced tea rating: 4 stars!  Delicious tea and plenty o' refills!

PS - Did I tell you that they serve warm mini pretzel breads at the table?  OMG yum!. We had a group of neighbors visit during restaurant week.  The steaks and veggies were just "flat" outstanding.   To us, it was perhaps the best in town. Service was superb.  Will be back soon.. Panda Express is Panda Express. It's not gourmet or even great. It's good. This food is reliable and quick and you know it will be enjoyable. Also this location is staffed with professionals who know what they are doing. For that they squeak out a 4th star.. The name of this museum is a misleading. It does provide a general history of atomic testing, but focuses heavily on the Nevada test site. The New Mexico test site and Pacific testing are mentioned only briefly. My favorite part of the museum was the first area which shows the influence atomic testing had on popular culture. This is the area where the Walt Disney produced educational video on atomic energy can be viewed. It is the first of many videos at this museum. To really get a good understanding of the subject you really do need to take the time to watch all of the videos. I was hoping the museum would have more of the pop culture stuff especially pertaining to Las Vegas (casinos used to advertise atomic testing as a tourist attraction). Based on what is mentioned on their website, they will soon be opening an exhibit focusing on the link between atomic testing and Las Vegas.

The middle part of the museum is about the actual testing. There is a simulation room where you get a feeling of what it would have been like to view a test as well as recreations of some of the facilities. This part was also pretty interesting. The last part focuses on how they are currently trying to dispose of nuclear materials. There are a lot of hands on exhibits in this part including a chance to handle some ultra low level radioactive material. I would imagine those who are more interested in science would enjoy the last section more than history/sociology buffs like myself that enjoyed the first part more. There is also a random exhibit about Native Americans for those that are interested in anthropology/archeology. 

I do feel that the museum largely ignores some of the social and moral issues associated with atomic testing, however I do not think that they did so to be pro-atomic weapons. As I mentioned earlier, the main focus of the museum is on the Nevada test site. The focus is so narrow that there really isn't much room for discussion about the philosophical aspects of atomic energy. It just wouldn't fit in this museum. It is brought up in a few of the videos and I found that they did present both points of view, although some of the more heinous aspects of atomic history such as the birth defects due to Pacific island testing and the use of atomic weapons against Japan, are not really discussed since this museum focuses on Nevada (although both issues are briefly mentioned). I also had no idea what they were thinking with the 9/11 exhibit. There was some artwork in there showing the WTC with a mushroom cloud in the background. I wasn't sure what they were trying to suggest.

Overall, I though it was a nice museum with very good exhibits and a little something for everyone. The gift shop small and kind of boring.. Love, love, love this place!   I am a BIG FAN of Kettle Korn and this place rocks.

Kids love the frozen popcorn.

The owners are cool too.. Outstanding tailoring. There is a wait depending on the time of year (I picked prom season recently, so a two week wait) as there's only one tailor there at a time (it's a small place.) The quality is fantastic; have had a suit, jeans, and a blazer jacket tailored there and they are VERY accommodating to your desires for the piece. I've used quite a few tailors, mostly in Cleveland and Pittsburgh, but this is my go to place. Prices are very reasonable, though cash and check only. I wanted to write a review so everyone else can see for themselves.. Are you looking for a small and encouraging place to reach your physical goals? Lifting weights or running on the treadmill is just too boring for you? Or perhaps you're looking for structured work outs? MAYBE there is a ultra burning desire to redeem yourself from a lack of uber performance at a previous obstacle race. I marked E for all of the above. 

Back in October I did Tough Mudder with some friends, and was greatly disappointed with my personal performance. It wasn't because I didn't finish (we did, in a decent time), but 6-7 months multiple times a week was dedicated to get ready for the crazy mud run. To only finish "OK" wasn't "OK" with me so once a Groupon appeared for Ultimate Training Center's CrossFit classes and some YouTube researching on what CrossFit is, I took the plunge and made UTC sort of a second home.

I'm addicted to CrossFit. CrossFit helps you attain a level of fitness that is measurable by day to day activities in regards to functional movements or "preparing for the unknown" hence their slogan "forging elite fitness".  I've only been coming to UTC for two months and I am not getting significantly bigger, but I am getting STRONGER and more ATHLETIC. I didn't realize how much I changed physically until the day I brought my friend (whom has always been more fit than me in the past) in for a few classes and our fitness levels was on different levels. The workout of the day (WOD) changes everyday, so it doesn't get boring. There are times written on a board so you can compare yourself to others (muy excellente for those ultra competitive people). That's enough talking about why CrossFit is the sh!t though, this review is for UTC. 

UTC staff is always friendly, classes are available early morning, afternoon, and in the evening for the 9-5 workers. Its clean, doesn't stink, there is a shower available, and the coaches are awesome. Chris really focuses on proper technique, has you scale the weight according to YOUR abilities, is encouraging, cares about how you perform, and has jokes. Barre and TRX classes are also offered. 

I have my first Spartan Race on 02/10/13 and thanks to UTC I feel ready to make the obstacle my b!tch. 

http://summerlincrossfit.com/ See you in class.. This is one of the places to be on such a hot day. This location is in a plaza. There is plenty of parking. There is no outside seating. Trust me, in this hot temperature, you will not miss it. There are tables and seating for about 20 people. The restrooms are clean and well-maintained. The décor is nice and has a friendly, lively theme.

After sampling a bunch of Italian ice flavors, I decided to get a gelati, which is combination of Italian ice with frozen custard. I decided to get the pear and mango orange flavored ice with vanilla custard. The regular size portion is definitely enough for one person. The combination tasted great. The flavored ice and the custard go so well together. Another good thing is during the hot temperatures, the custard is a bit more difficult to melt than ice cream, which allows for more time to consume it. On the sweet level I have to say it wasn't too sweet but it wasn't bland at all. All in all, it was a good balance.

The service here is great. No one was around so we had all the attention to us. The worker was kind of enough to sample many different ice flavors! Since it was my first time there it was important as I had no clue what to order. This place is definitely a good alternative to ice cream or frozen yogurt if you're not in the mood for those.. It's a five star review: this place has what it takes to knock it out the park and I hope they meet your expectations of a swanky gastropub if you should pay them a visit. Some of the beers are a little pricey, but supply and demand is what it is and I'm only referring to some of the bottled offerings there. On tap is a good range and you won't go thirsty.

A lot of new student accommodation has recently opened up just feet away - the prices may help maintain the ambience and slightly exclusive nature of The Fountain, but only time will tell.

The food is the star of the show though. Pick yourself a beef shin pie and that's what you'll be getting: a whole lotta beef, with a bit of shin in there too (surprisingly heavy is cow bone). No carrot filler, all bovine killer, in a delightful sauce that you can soak up with your mashed potato side.

The battered fish and chips will keep you filled up for days, but beware the starters for they are mighty in their proportions and may prevent you finishing your battered treat.

The staff are generally great too. This place is an asset to all Edinburgh, particularly on this side of town.. One of the best steaks I've ever had. Ordered the following sides for a table of 5:

-Truffled cream corn (super good)
-Mac and cheese (above average)
-Asparagus (I don't know what to do with green vegetables at a steak house. They confuse me)
-Fries (meh)

My bone-in rib-eye was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I topped it with the seared foie gras, and honestly, while I love buttery, fatty goose liver, the steak didn't need it. I just figured that I would go all-out over-the-top VEGAS, BABY, VEGAS! with it. 

As many reviewers have already mentioned, the fresh bread basket was superb. The fresh sourdough and bacon cheddar bread were warm out of the oven and delicious. When we were packing to go, I mentioned that "I wouldn't mind if some of those bacon cheddar rolls somehow ended up in there" and our server packed up an entire container of extra bread for us! 

Next time, I will try the funnel cake, because that looks awesome. Total tab (with a moderately expensive bottle of wine) came out to about $110 pp. Not too shabs.. Great staff. Location is clean and very presentable. New kitchen inside. Someone is always willing to help.. Went to this place while in Vegas for March Madness. Had a buddy who was there as well that weekend and we needed a golden tee fix.  Might as well gamble on that in vegas too, right?? As the story goes, we took a long cab ride, but this place was SO worth it. 

Drinks were about 90% cheaper than the strip and were strong. Doubles were ordered for an extra BUCK, and were not needed, these were strong drinks. Staff were very friendly and didnt have the "anti-tourist" attitude. The golden tee game was in good shape and it was a real neighborhood bar. 

Food was lacking, but then all of a sudden a relative of the owner (who apparently is a cook on the strip at one of the major hotels) brings a slab of ribs, potatoes and other assorted food - for free. 

Long cab ride back, but will be making the trip again this year, and making this a stop while in town.. Great spot! I've been here twice and split about 10 dishes with people. Everything has been delicious and they also have a great local beer selection!. Came here to celebrate my last night at Vegas.

As an FYI, the price for the dinner buffet is $29.95 from Sunday-Thursday and their gourmet buffet (Fridays and Saturdays) is $36.95.

Another FYI- all non-alcoholic beverages are included in the price but alcoholic drinks are not

When we got to the line and saw how the line snaked around, I was nervous and pissed off because I thought I'd have to wait; (I'm the impatient type you see pacing around when waiting to be seated ;) however, the line was moving and very efficient and we were seated down in about 20 minutes.

When I saw the buffet in this place, it seemed neverending; I counted about 9-10 different stations, all separated by ethnicity or types of food. Since I went on a Friday, I paid for the gourmet buffet, which includes Beef Wellington (I think that's why the price difference)

The beef wellington was amazing; very tender and juicy along with everything else. As I ate, I saw a person in the next table of me sitting down with a pile (and I mean a pile) of stone crabs and just watching him devour it was amazing.

The service was good, not outstanding, but again, you don't come here for the service, just the food :). The food was fantastic. The pupusas were stuffed with more cheese than most places I've eaten at and we're delicious! Very easy on the wallet too. I took my mom there yesterday and we had 6 pupusas, some fried yucca, a side of crema (sour cream), and two sodas and our total $23 and change! Would have given 5 stars but the service prevented that. It wasn't bad service but our waitress had a little trouble understanding my order. She wasn't completely fluent in English. Other than that, great spot and we'll be back.. Cheap, but in a good way. Think hospital cafeteria, but you're in a casino and you're about to save a lot of money having all you can eat food that is mostly edible.. HELLOOOOO new cravings....

I love tacos (of all kinds but soft corn is the best)!

My wife went to high school with the manager so she dragged me in for lunch today on our way home from the children's museum. Located on the east side of 7th street in a used to be house. A line to the door usually means it is good and it was! 

We had to take the food togo so I was already thinking that it was going to be sub par. I was so wrong.
I had two asada tacos and a bean and cheese burrito.  The tacos were perfect with the lime and the smokey salsa that came with them. The tortillas were soft but not soggy, the meat was smokey and tender and packed with flavor. The burrito was creamy and rich with melted cheese everywhere and beans that were not too heavy. 

I can't wait to go back... and soon.

Thank you America's for making a no fuss slam dunk taco shop!. This is a great place. I replaced my watch battery very cheap and plan to come back to buy one of their clocks.. Super cool people here!! Come check them out. One of my favorites.  Always good food and service... Prices are fair.   Try their Pizza and then have some Baklava!. Interesting delicious flavor combinations. My whole family gobbled up our respective dishes. 

Wifey got a yum vegetarian club sandwich that I want to get next time, it was so flavorful and not vegetarian-like. What I mean is that it wasn't just a boring sandwich with the meat taken out. It was full of flavors and textures. I want one now. 

The younger boys got a pork club they both loved and devoured. 

The surfer dude got a Thai po'boy he loved. 

And I started with an AMAZING thai clam chowder, really the best chowder I've ever had. My only complaint is that it wasn't triple the size so that I could take some home for two or three more meals. I also got the fries which came with a spicy tangy sauce, all gone. My entrée was the special, a chicken curry, yummy, but I was hoping for more wow.

We all got their home-made chips, very moist and very flavorful, definitely not from a bag, ate 'em all gone. 

In protest for being required to spend time with his family, grumpy hormonal teenager #1Son ordered just chips & slaw, but ended up nibbling everyone else's cuz he was hungry and it was all so good. 

My wife, who is a much more stern critic than I, said "five stars for the cleanliness, the cheerful attentive staff, the creative flavors, the vegetarian options", and the fact that it's five minutes from our house is a bonus. 

Definitely would come back with my whole family, or alone. 

The "$$" rating is fair, as it cost us $65 feeding 5 fully (and #1 Son Grumpy only got two sides) with no drinks, before tip.

The decor is cozy cafeteria, not institutional, walls paneled in lovely bamboo.. Just Vapin is a phenomenal place. The service is absolutely incredible with friendly, kind, and generous staff. There is a wide selection of e-juice, and I always make it a point to try a new one each visit.. Amazing wine list, ask about the vintages, I was a little worried about my super Tuscan until a 2007 arrived at our table. The food is delicious as well, I had a rigatoni with filet and truffles, amazing! The eggplant appetizer was truly fantastic as well.. It is so worth it to come in on a Sunday night to hear the Acoustic MadMen. I am biased, though...

This is a fun place to stop in or spend the evening if you like the music.  The alcohol is reasonable priced, the food is quite good, too.  My favs being Guiness (24oz) and the Bananas Foster to drink and burgers & the truffles fries for nomming.  Some exceptional items are:

- Truffles Fries: "...tossed with white truffle oil, Parmesan cheese & fresh parsley." Contains no truffle, though still quite good.  (Google "white truffle oil" and you'll be a bit shocked)

- Prime Rib Sliders served with blue cheese & horseradish sauce.  Cooked to your temp & generally great beefy flavor with just enough bite that you don't eat the entire beef slice in your first bite. 

I typically go late on weekends which can be quite busy, so service does degrade a bit.  Lunch service has been good so far. 

Go for 2 Timin' Tuesdays for 2for1 burgers.  Eat one there & get the other to go, even!

I am a repeat customer due to my preference for music, but would easily go there for the food & semi-Irish atmosphere, too.. Fast delivery, good food, I recommend this and they will be my first call for Chinese food from now on.. Very good. Not had a ton of great experiences elsewhere with Tai food, but this place is great. My wife had the Pad Tai noodles with chicken and shrimp and I had the chow main style noodles with chicken.

You can customize your level of spicy between 0-5 and we both had level 3 and that was perfect if not a little too hot so level 5 must be banana sandwich. Do not judge this place by the outside as it is small but there were a few people who stopped in while we were here. While we were here we got complimentary coconut ice cream.. I've been fortunate enough to travel to Thailand twice.  It's a beguiling place.  The most remarkable thing about Thailand is the friendliness of its people.  Everyone smiles in Thailand, regardless of how humble their circumstances may be.  Thai Hut is a sheer delight because it reminds me of the best of Thailand.  The staff at this restaurant is always smiling and their happiness is infectious.  

The setting for the restaurant has a fun and funky vibe.  It looks like Flo's Diner was redecorated by Thom Filicia with decor from the Suan Lum Night Bazzar in Bangkok and a Mid-century Modern reproduction house.  The choice of location on McDowell across from the Phoenix Art Museum is great.  

Whether or not the food at Thai Hut is authentic is a moot point.  In Thailand I tasted a wide variety of even the most basic dishes such as Tom Kha Kai soup and Larb.  It all depended on the chef and their given preparations and quirks.  What sets the food in Thailand apart from what you will generally find in the US is the level of spice.  The food in Thailand varies in heat intensity from Nuclear Hot to Surface of the Sun Hot.  I've seen Thai folks enthusiastically devour Tom Yum soup that was so hot it made them weep.  I've also tasted a dish spiced with pepper-infused vinegar that was so hot it literally took my breath away along with some taste buds.   

With all that said, the food at Thai Hut is great with an appropriate amount of spice for the average Phoenician's palate.  My favorite soup is Tom Kha Kai and the Thai Hut version is luscious due to all the silky coconut milk they use.  It makes a great start to a meal.  The standby Sa-Tay appetizer is delicious as the chicken is spiced with curry before grilling and the peanut sauce is delightfully sweet.  I believe the sauce is enriched with coconut milk.  The Fresh Rolls are also very tasty, but the BF does not like that they include large pieces of green onion in them.  He pulls out the green onion pieces before enjoying his Fresh Rolls and all is good again for us at Thai Hut.

Thai Hut offers a variety of entrees and all have proven to be tasty.  The Cashew Nut dish offers up a mix of sauteed cashews, onions, green peppers and your choice of protein in a savory sauce.  The sauce balances well with the cashews and it brings out their natural sweetness.  The Pineapple Fried Rice is a delicious choice that includes lovely chunks of fresh pineapple and cashews.  The Ultimate Asparagus dish comes from the Chef's Special section of the menu.  It offers fresh asparagus stir-fried with shrimp and chicken in a savory brown garlic sauce.  I totally understand why it's in the Chef's Special section as it's delightful.  

The Thai Iced Tea is also appropriately sweet and the milk is a nice respite from the spice in the dishes.

Thai Hut also offers its menu at a very wallet-friendly price point.  I used to enjoy Wild Thaiger, but it has become too expensive for what it is.  Thai Hut offers better food at about half the price.  Thai Hut has knocked Wild Thaiger off as my standard Thai restaurant.

Thai Hut offers take out and we placed a large order of Sa-Tay and Fresh Rolls for our Tacky Tiki Gay Pride Brunch and the proprietors were very accommodating.. They have a little bar with cafe seating right before you walk into the street scape. They had 1/2 price martini's. I thought that you had to order 2 of the same. So I got 4. Two of each. When I got mine it burnt the hair out of my nose. The pomegranate was there just for color. I asked for a couple of olives because I was getting hungry. They were huge and very tasty. This is a great place to people watch. Some old fart parked his walker next to our table and proceeded to talk about baseball for the next half hour. I had no idea what he was yaking about? But he was amusing. The service was great. Next time I am staying at this hotel. They have everything.. Service was great.  First timer, so the man behind the counter helped with ordering.  Suggested options, offered free soup, recommend dishes, etc...

Food was well prepared, tasted good and quick.  In and out in less than 30 minutes.

Would definetly recommend this place if you like Greek food and friendly people.. Update: Recent full remodel bumps this pizza gem to 5 stars.  Famous Ray's is THE BEST.. The salmon cakes were unbeatable. I had those, green beans and collard greens. Everything was prepared to perfection. Oh, and the cornbread was so tasty. Our group was super hungry and we were all raving about how good the food was and it was filling. Good value for the money. And the waitress was so sweet and attentive. This has got to be one of the best soul food restaurants anywhere.. Easy to make a appointment and really takes the time to get to know your issues and work on a solution that will get you back on your feet and not just coming back to him for more.  I trust him in and his knowledge.. The price is right and the room was clean.  The people who work there are very friendly and helpful.  I met a manager twice in the elevators and the lady that cleaned the room.  Good people.. It is rare to have restaurants like this that people needs to peel shrimps and eat crawfish in the states, but I enjoyed it so much, as the process of eating is fun as well. I went to this restaurant by myself without any hesitation, and then ordered half pound of shrimp and one pound of crawfish. The waitress is very friendly and explains the menu in detail. The food is served on table within 2 minutes, when it is a Sunday evening and the whole restaurant is already full. The spice smells terrific, and both dishes taste so good. I finished them like a hog! If you enjoy spicy food, this is definitely a must to go place!. Excellent cheese plate with local cheeses.  A very good selection of wines. Wonderful ambience.. We have been here 3 times now and it has always been a good experience. The pizza biscuits are a great starter and the service has always been great for us.. Like Shauna, I am also surprised at the other reviews.  
I have visited PJ's several times, and have never had a bad experience.  The food has ALWAYS been spot on and the wait staff has been incredible each time.  
My personal favorite is the fish and chips, which has always had a great flavor, and a wonderful breading on them, that definately does not dissapoint.  The price seems a little bit steep until you see how much fish you get! It definately has plenty of food on the plate for you. 
The atmosphere has always been clean, and with the live music that they have, its hard to turn the place down.
If your looking for someplace to sit and enjoy, this could very well be the place for you!. I heard that the MGM did a whole new renovation/ makeover of some of the rooms! I decided to see what everything was like. I've stayed at the MGM some years ago and wasn't too impressed! However this time around it was a 360 degree change! I was suprinsgly upgraded to a Executive King Suite! Why? Not sure! But who would ask questions right? The room was absolutely fantastic! Very spacious, clean, and the decorations and layout were very stunning. i stayed on the 27th floor and had an exceptional view! I would recommend this hotel to anybody!. Recommendation. Lovely place. Service has always been great and the specials are super.  
Really nice place with parking in the back easy to access.. These wings are the real deal. Crisp skin with lots of meat and real flavor in the sauce. Not just a dose of spice without real flavor like most wings. Be sure to add seasoning to your fries. Super cool staff made our visit extra enjoyable!. My friends and I travel to Scottsdale every Labor Day. We found this cigar shop by chance 4 years ago. It was a pleasant surprise. We've been going back ever sense. I can't wait to see their new location. They have a great selection and we love the Vartan cigars.. Was here for the first time today and found lots of great stuff from as little as a pound.Ended up getting quite a few singles.Will go back again, and for some of the more specialised singles that I am looking for will use the online service.. Although this seems like a much older Taco Bell in to need of remodeling the food never seems to suffer and the staff are generally friendly. They have diet Mountain Dew on tap which not all Taco Bell seem to have. This location is easy to get in and out of even during rush hour traffic times.. Great service and quality work. They always answer phone or call back when you have a question. Their installing crew is professional and does a great job of cleaning up any left behind debris. They use high quality Owens Corning™ Shingles, I am satisfied with their work and would refer them to a friend.. Wonderful annual event. Claims to attract 200,000 visitors, with nearly 500 artisans and food providers. I can't confirm the attendance numbers, but I can verify that there were a lot of booths from which to choose.

Admission is free. Parking is free. A bit of a small town feel, such as ordering lunch from the local Kiwanis group, but with a high volume of vendors. Plenty of pottery, dog hats, jewelry, art work, crafts... pretty much everything you don't really need. Some standard. Some unique. Some expensive. Some remarkably cheap.

I only purchased food. That's how I roll! But others is my group bought earrings, dog bowls and well, I'm not certain what else. Fun was had by all. The little ones most enjoyed the Post cereal samples and running in the park by the fountain (both free).

We'll definitely be back next year.. This place is just amazing. I love everything about it. The food is great, the price is fair. The selection is great as well. I love the idea of Mexican and Korean fusion, wish I could come here more but living in Henderson makes this place far.. Gerald and his crew are awesome.  Over the years we have had 5 or 6 guys and The Pool Steward is the best by far.  They charge a reasonable monthly fee and do a great job.  Normally that is what I expect and I wouldn't be writing a review.  Before I hired them, I took my green water to Leslies who told me I needed to drain my pool, which I had just done less than a year ago.  I called Gerald and he came out and put in a device called PoolRX and it cleared up my pool in 2 days.  I have never had cleaner water and now we enjoy our pool a ton more.. Im a fan. Best cheesesteaks I've had  in the valley.. I wish we had a Trader Joes in Hawaii!! But unfortunately for me they don't and that is why "I Love This Place". 

Reasons:
Easy to find.
Great quality products at great prices(Cheaper then Hawaii)
Clean and well stocked store.
Friendly staff.

Mahalo! Trader Joes for cutting down my list of things to bring back for friends!. My girlfriend and I came here after finding a place close to our house. She's a little inexperienced with Vietnamese food, so I was hoping it would be something she liked so we could come here often, as I am a huge fan of Vietnamese cuisine. Hands down best I've found in the valley. She had #54, I had #52. EXCELLENT is an understatement! We'll become regulars, I'm sure!. The wife and I tried this place out one evening when we were feeling like a wrap for dinner.  I had the barbecue chicken wrap and the wife had the chicken salad wrap.  Both were delicious.  The service was great.  Both employees were very friendly and attentive.  The prices were also reasonable, which I appreciate.  There were several items on the menu that looked good so I can't wait to try it again.. First time buffet guy... I got all you can eat Alaskan crab, prime rib, lox and a tasty meatball plus desert and wine! Crab was great! No complaints about this place! Except for the disturbing amount of food tourists leave uneaten on their plates.. Small restaurant. Decent size parking lot. Good place for sushi and appetizers. Service is excellent.. I guess when you're in El Salvador you gotta love the pupusas and they did a great job price was fair not on the cheap side but worth it because the quality was great the staff was kind to me even they put up with my broken Spanish. I will definitely go back and try some of the other items that they offer and continue to practice my Spanish laugh out loud. Excellent local coffee shop.  Roast their own.

Nice decor, olé Matador!

The lounge chairs and sofas in the back are cozy and awesome!  Just wished the lady using it would stand up...

Great coffee overall!. The best bar west of the Mississippi River !!! Great service , great food , great owners !!! You have to try their chili !!! Thanks chad and Debbie !! Best part they are open til 2 am everyday !!! Great place for people visiting to come have a few and enjoy a few drinks and food!!!!. I've been taking Krav Maga here for many months.  The studio is small, but clean, and well equipped and maintained.  After studying martial arts in a few different studios, USA Pro stands out, thanks to the Sensei, George.  You couldn't ask for a friendlier, more good natured teacher.  He also knows his stuff, and creates balanced, engaging, dynamic, and well structured classes.

Any parent or student considering the studio can be confident that they and theirs will develop their physical and mental strength and discipline in a positive and supportive environment.  In Karate Kid terms, if your philosophy is more Mr Miyagi, than than Cobra Kai than this is the dojo for you!. Very fresh and delicious food.  I would recommend the Carne Asada burrito and the street tacos.  I occasionally get the Carnitas in the  tacos but it has been hit or miss lately.  The salsa they include with the meal is fantastic.  My wife loves the bean and cheese burritos.  Pro-tip:  If you are going through the drive thru bring a book, iPad or gaming device.  It is going to be a while but it's worth the wait.. Tonkatsu is amazing. Go to ramen place for sure. 

They have pork belly that can get addicting 

I would go all the time if I could. So I do. Only one word comes to mind when I think about this hotel - BOOM! The room and decor were enough for 4 stars, but the staff really cranked up the rating. Best hospitality staff I have ever encountered! Be sure to check out the restaurant for some crazy drinks you would never think of making on your own.. Phenomenal frozen yogurt! Best tasting and most creative flavors I have ever had. I am sad that they got rid of buy one get one free Thursdays. Now it's buy one get one half off on Thursdays. When I asked the employee why this was she said it was because the owner was going to use the extra money to invest it into the community... How bout you invest that money back into my wallet and give it for free again. Owner is really nice and the yogurt is so good I could never give this place anything less than 5 stars.. Great large slices of pizza! Salads and wings are great too... Good lunch for under $10. We buy 3-4 of the party pizzas for work and the guys love it!. Similar to other Black Bear Diners, this one also features numerous wooden bear and other rustic designs. In addition to the art and an assortment of hats and shirts, they have one of the best breakfast menus you will ever see! I have eaten tons of the things on the menu and have yet to be disappointed! So if you are looking for a big, hearty, non-healthy, delicious breakfast stop by the Diner today! Also gets pretty busy on Sunday mornings!. Great pools, nicely appointed rooms, flat screen HDTV's, and a short drive to the strip.  I love this Worldmark resort!. I just moved out of Mozart's Arlington building in Shadyside, and I wanted to write a review to counteract some of the negative press that Mozart has been been getting on Yelp and elsewhere. The reason I moved out was mainly due to increasing rent and my desire to check out one of the other neighborhoods in Pittsburgh for a change of pace.

Personally, I had no real issues with Mozart. The building was always kept clean and everyone I talked to -- from the maintenance guys to management -- was polite and helpful. The rooms in the Arlington were very quiet (I never heard my neighbors except for when people were talking while through the hallways). Heat (since it's included in rent) was reasonable, if a little hot at times. I'd say the overall condition of my apartment was above average. It's a really old building (~1910), but the amenities were kept reasonably up to date.

A couple notes that people might want to be aware of:

-Mozart requires that you let them know if you're moving out in February (6 months before your lease expires in August). I think that's pretty excessive, but it's their policy.
-Mozart does not require a security deposit, so I'm not sure why some people are saying Mozart took their security deposit...
-They have a "broom clean" policy which means essentially that as long as your apartment isn't gross when you move out, it's cool. So when you move into a new Mozart apartment, don't expect it to be spotless.

Overall, I would say Mozart is a pretty safe bet if you're looking for an apartment in Pittsburgh. They have a few quirks, but I didn't really mind and would definitely rent with them again.. Probably my favorite bar in Phoenix. Local music and craft beer are pretty much the best combo.. I cannot tell you how afraid of going to the dentist for a root canal I was...

Dr. Angela Catalano and her top tier staff and beautiful facilities made this visit nothing short of wonderful. No pain, perfect service...

I am a believer, and now am looking forward (in a way) to getting my cleanings here and any other services. 

Can't even say enough good things about this practice.

:). YUM!  Writing this review makes me want to go back right now!!!  May I suggest you begin your meal with their signature drink?  It's called a "stole-doli" and its addictive!  It is served in a chilled martini glass.  It is pineapple infused vodka.  If you enjoy fresh seafood I highly recommend you order their seafood plateau.  It is in one word, INCREDIBLE!  Worth every $$$ you spend.  Great wine selection and amazing steaks.  The kona crusted steak is killer.  The fish is good too.  Ask for a window seat that faces the strip.. C'était la 2e fois que j'allais souper chez pollo.  La 1ere fois ça venait juste d'ouvrir et nous avions été très déçu, et bien cette fois-ci nous prouve que les accros d'ouverture sont bel et bien passés.

Nous avons commencé avec les croquettes de morue et l'entrée de crevettes, sardines et callemars grillés, le tout était excellent.

Comme repas principal les cotelettes d'agneau étaient parfaites.

Les prix sont peut-être un peu élevé mais sinon c'est vraiment bien, en plus le service était rapide et très courtois.

Je recommande fortemrnt.. I love Ruth Chris' and I would've given this 5 stars but server Lawrence had a pissy demeanor. For me to have to ask if we can order drinks and scrape the table of crumbs is unacceptable for Ruth Chris. Luckily my Strip was the bomb. Management please talk to Lawrence and don't make the assumption 3 guys in their 20's don't deserve to be treated poorly.. Cody, Russ, Kenny and Diego were awesome.  This is a Vegas MUST DO.  For $150 bucks, you can zip line through the canyons and cliffs of Boulder City with great views of Vegas and Lake Mead - you might even get to see a bicycle wreck or two.  Did I mention you can get up to 75-80 mph on one of the 4 super long zip lines.  Get the picture package for $30 and don't worry about a camera.

One word: AWESOME!. I've eaten here a total of three times with some varying degrees of deliciousness, but I have to say that the most recent visit was the best.  I've never had a problems with service, although for my first visit, I was seated at the bar.  It's not easy to get great service at a bar... Anyways, this last visit was by far the best.  I had the pretzels with the home made dijon, a bowl of the corn chowder with a basil creme fresh, and the heirloom tomato sandwich.  Let's break these bad boys down:

1) The pretzels weren't anything ridiculously amazing, but the dijon mustard is the star.  You can tell it's fresh.  It's a coarse-ground mustard that has plenty of heat.  If you put too much, it will clear out your sinuses, but wasn't retardedly/annoyingly hot.  

2) I'd have to say that the corn chowder wasn't my favorite, but it had some good flavor combinations.  The chowder was sweet and had some crab meat placed in, which made it much more sweet that I usually go for.  I'd kind of like something sour (citrus/lime juice possibly) to cut the sweetness.  But the creme fresh paired well to smooth the flavors out.  It cut into the sweetness a bit.  There was a bit of julienned basil to also help cut the sweetness.  Overall, pretty good.

3) The heirloom tomato sandwich is EXCELLENT.  Crispy bread with a citrusy aoli.  Perfectly rip tomatoes with thinly shaved parmessian on top.  Awesome.  I want another one for dinner.  Sh*t, I'd eat one for breakfast.  The freshness of the tomatoes work perfectly for a hot day.  And it was light enough not to weigh me doswn, unlike a shepherd's pie or a flat iron steak+fixin's.  No post-lunch naps required...

All in all, good execution and a great place to take someone to, since you'll be able to have good conversation about the decor, ipad drink menu, and presentation.. The best place to score Under Armour gear at below sale prices if you follow their emails.  Great selection for an outlet store.  They have a great 2 for sales.  Last sale got a pair of blue workout shorts with matching work out t shirt for $30.  Smokin.  The heat gear is perfect for Arizona summers and Nike has nothing considerable to really compare to in selection and price.  Also periodically they will run special sales, buy $100 of gear get $20 gift card.. I played Kokopelli a couple of weeks ago and found the course and staff beyond my expectations . The fairways and greens were well kept and I might add, challenging. The Pro Shop staff were friendly and helpful, not to mention the great green fees and lunch on top of the other offers. My recommendation is
 enthusiastically offered to any golf lovers who want a great experience. Hoyt Davis. The store is always clean and they have people there that have always been very helpful. I go to this store a lot and I do a lot of my home improvement myself. This store is great, but the only complaint that I have and I know I am now in the minority, I have noticed more and more people are bringing their dogs to the store. This, to me could be a problem. I expect to see pets at pet stores, but do not understand bringing your pets in stores where it is so many things going on. I am not sure about the rules at home improvement stores and this may be legally acceptable, but it just don't seem like the smart thing to do.
This store has everything you could possibly need....GREAT store!!. 5 Stars! 
Very friendly staff, they were available for the time I needed and was able to complete the job faster than originally quoted (only took 30 minutes instead of 45).
Clean shop and great staff.. I eat a lot of veggie burgers. It's a thing. I love burger joints, especially the recent trend of quick casual spots popping up left and right. For me, it's always a challenge to find a veggie burger that is more than a Morningstar Farms patty that's overcooked.

Search no further. Burger 21's Black Bean Burger is a game changer. I ordered mine sans red onion and substituted their utterly perfect brioche for the whole wheat bun that comes standard. 

I devoured every morsel happily. So, so good. I'll easily recommend this place to meat and veggie lovers alike.

They also have banging fries, of  both the regular and sweet potato variety. And a plethora of dipping sauces ranging from toasted marshmallow (you either love it or hate it) to thai ketchup.

The burgers are thick and juicy, and there is no end to the number of combinations you can try. The Mr recently ordered the tuna burger, while friends went with The Skinny (turkey burger). 

I think this chain is doing things right, and I have no doubt that Burger21 will be successful in this new Ballantyne location.. Excellent oatmeal. Highly recommend!. [This is a preliminary review for Nosh & Swig because the place has only been open a week and does not have a liquor license yet (though they are BYOB)]

Nosh & Swig is a fusion tapas restaurant with some tasty dishes and fun food combinations.  The food is creative and the kitchen sends out dishes plated in imaginative designs on the plate.  Between the plating of the food and the inventive flavor combinations, Nosh & Swig is a place where you're encouraged to play with your food.

We ordered a few meat plates and each was expertly-prepared, creatively plated, and fun.  The Nachos O'Brien consists of peppered pork on potato chips with stewed tomatoes in a creamy bechamel cheese sauce.  The flavors of the meat and cheese sauce were surprisingly well-balanced.  The potato chips were prepared by the kitchen and the fried flavor might have been too strong, but the peppered pork stands strong and the cheese sauce blends the whole dish.  The kitchen also did a great job with the short ribs plate--the ribs were glazed with Dr. Pepper.  The glaze was sweet and thick on the expertly-prepared, tender beef, which is served on amazingly sweet, crisp polenta cornbread and candied carrots.  The candied carrots were a bit much, but everything else was brilliant.

The non-meat dishes were similarly imaginative.  The salmon skewers came cleverly prepared in a miso sweet glaze, making the fish taste almost honeyed.  The kitchen added a fresh seaweed salad that was an excellent compliment to the dish.  

Our favorite dish on the menu was the Elote plate--corn covered in a sauce of garlic butter, cayenne and cilantro.  Wonderful combination--creamy and tart.  The dish is messy, but who cares.  The sauce mixes exceptionally well with the fresh corn underneath. 

Measuring the plates on their own, I think I'd only re-order the Elote, but that doesn't mean I didn't love Nosh & Swig.  The other three dishes we had were clever and fun to experience.  So much that I want to head back and try several more dishes.

Note on the newer-status of the restaurant: Right now, the restaurant seems a little awkward.  The space is designed to be sleek and cosmopolitan--metal tables and comfy booths with small bookcases on the wall including books and busts.  They're not filling up the restaurant yet, so the space feels a little empty, but its more than compensated for by a staff that's working hard to make sure the customers are satisfied.. Wife and I ate here for a brunch/lunch meal on a Saturday. We arrived prior to opening so seated right away which was a good thing since it was packed by the time we left. Oysters appetizer and Gouda grits were crazy good. The grits are a must! The étouffée was rather average but there were many selections. We went here because I love Cajun food and did not realize it was on triple D. Cool little art area if you have time as well. Will try again when in town.. I love Your Helping Hands! I enjoyed their services so much, I wrote an article about them and put them on my website as a "Top Pick" of Las Vegas. Here it is below--

This is our top pick for house cleaning services in Las Vegas. They are thorough, dependable, and have successfully served the Las Vegas Valley since 1991. Even more, they use only safe and green products.

I've lived here two years and tried six different businesses. I've also heard plenty of horror stories from longtime residents. Don't be fooled by dirt cheap cleaning services; you get what you pay for. Some places rush over things, some places break things, some places take things. Some use strong-smelling, toxic chemicals that leave your place smelling like a grim hospital ward. Other places go through employees like air traffic controllers.  Once I was informed by a cleaning office that two experienced women would be arriving at 2pm sharp. At 2:25pm two guys approximately 18 and 19 roll up in a raggedy gangster car with no hubcaps and cracked rear window. They walk in, pants pulled down showing their boxers, carrying a cheap old vacuum with dangling cord. I say "Sorry guys, not happening."

Then one day I notice a shiny, practical, white hatchback parked across the street loaded with a variety of cleaning supplies. The car windows display a house cleaning advertisement/logo. Soon three industrious-looking women come bustling out my neighbor's apartment door, carrying vacuums and mops. I ask them for a flyer which they hand me with a smile.

Next week they clean my 2 bedroom apartment. Before they arrive, Cindy, a co-owner and manager, gives me a courteousy call to check in. The three-women crew does an amazing job. Everything is swept, cleaned, scrubbed, scoured, washed, emptied, dusted, polished, picked up, put away, folded, and now shiny. And get this:  it smells fine, too, light and clear, no crazy chemicals. They use only safe and green products. A few minutes after the girls leave, Cindy calls again, making sure all went well.

I was so impressed I used them again. They did another stellar job.

So I decided Las Vegas Top Picks should have a top pick for housecleaning, too. I asked to meet the owners, Cindy and Bobby. One spring afternoon I visited their office; we sipped peppermint tea and talked house cleaning.

They told me some funny stories of celebrity clients. One individual had a large cougar in his garage, which often sat atop a 100K+ luxury car scratching the bejesus out of it. Since they've been in business for nearly 22 years, they have many such stories! Such a length of time also exemplifies their success and trustworthiness. Bobby, the owner, takes pride in her work and good care of her "girls". Their website, which I hope you visit, further demonstrates this. It is comprehensive, professional, personal, and with a big clean heart. They work hard to tailor their cleaning to your precise specifications. In my experience, businesses that truly care about what they do provide the best service.

Also awesome was their giant city map pinned to an office wall. Was I in a secret CIA hub scouting the streets of Las Vegas? Or perhaps they just have tons of customers and know this town like the back of their helping hands.

They even have a mascot - a cute friendly little dog named Bella.  

I believe it's important to find skilled trustworthy businesses whenever spending money, doubly important when they come into your home on an ongoing basis. For house cleaning Your Helping Hands is TOP in this town!

http://lasvegastoppicks.com/your-helping-hands-house-cleaning/. I just can't get enough of their Nicoise Salad. And their fries and desserts are great. Need I say more!!. The majority of games are pinball machines. It has old school pinball machines from the 70's to recent pinball machines like Tron and Avatar. There's acouple of arcade games like MIssle Command and Astroids. While you're here play with Peppy the Clown.. I was here with Sophie A. and man- what an amazing find!  This is like, the coolest bowling alley I've ever seen in my whle life.  It's like that dream sequence in the big lebowski- where the dude is bowling at the infinite bowling alley in heaven.  this is that place- it's heaven for bowlers.  It's also a great place to kill a few hours if you are in the Palms/Gold Coast/Rio neighborhood.  It's not that cheap- cost us $20 to bowl three games for two people, but the sure gloriousness of it all more then made up for the price.  Also, the hall of fame pictures they have lining the wall- all people who bowled 300 games or whatever- are hysterical.  You really should check this place out if you are in the neighborhood.. F1 is pretty sweet... cost is a little much but it's expensive to maintain all those karts and run a huge building and I'm sure the insurance is a killer too... 

Aside from that the racing is usually good as long as you go with your own group and don't get somebody who can't drive or at least understand to let you pass if they're all over the track with no driving line.  (Sorry technical racer here).

Best nights (though busy) are when the open up the dividers and make the two tracks into one big one... SUPER technical and way too much fun.

This is good for groups too as I know they have business team building events available.  We've done the beginning of a bachelor party here and birthdays a plenty

There's food there, though expensive and just typical bar food so eat prior to coming (just don't lose your cookies).  

There's an arcade too for kids or whoever's waiting to race.  I think they had a climbing wall in there too... random?. I've been coming here on and off for almost 20 years now.  Food is consistent and prices are good.  Done both pickup and delivery.  Always surprised at how fast the delivery times are. I love their beef and broccoli and their Mongolian beef. My kids like their orange chicken. Never been unhappy once.. One of my favorite restaurants, can't quite put my finger on why, maybe it's the atmosphere the great German beer.  Just always great food, the pretzel rolls I could eat all day. 
Always there at least 4 times a year.. This place may have became my favorite burger joint. Was looking up somewhere to get some lunch and came across this place. I got the Jalapeño melt burger. The most amazing burger I have had in some time and the sauce was something else.. Wow, what a great place. Very classy, awesome acoustics, reasonable prices, easy to get to and easy getting out. We saw The Pink Floyd Experience tonight. There appears to be no bad seats. A great addition to Las Vegas!. Went back today and had a much better experience.  The food was nice and fresh and everything was good.  Walked in and was greeted pleasantly by the lady at the register,  Gave her my 7 bucks and ate too much.  The huge plus was they had General Tso's chicken.  Love it.  Walked out and she wished me a happy weekend.  I will go back once my Chinese Buffet timer resets.  I think the thing to remember is this place inst in the best area.  Its not dangerous or anything.  Would honestly be 5 stars on this visit but the place is a little rough.  You literally sink in the seats.. You can never go wrong with In and Out - Food is consistently great and staff always goes above and beyond!. Shaunz hooked it up like no one else. I was in town for a family affair and needed a trim.  I wasn't quite sure what I was looking for but I knew I needed a new style, the whole Into The Wild look was getting old. After talking for a bit and showing me some hip men's styles he finally convinced me to take a chance and go for something new. What can I say? It was one of the best cuts I've ever gotten and he couldn't have been a nicer dude, so down to earth and hilarious! If I'm ever back in town I'll be stopping in to see him again, maybe even get a little date...eh? EH?!. Showmars is outstanding!

This has to be my new "go to" spot for lunch if I am stuck between choices!  They never let you down!

I have never been disappointed in any item off the sandwich, pita or salad side of the menu.  I cannot speak for the "dinner" portions as I have not ventured to that side of the menu.

Their tag line says it all ... "Casual Dining ... Fast!"  You got that right.  The drive-thru is a quick and simple execution just like going inside to order "to go" or taking time to dine in.  They bring the food right out to you.  The staff is very friendly (that is hard to come by these days!) and are always eager to assist with anything including drink refills and clearing the table.

The interior is a simple design with your standard dining booths and they provide a few televisions throughout for you to catch up on via news stations and the four letter sports network.. This is one of those excellent buffets in LV! The line is really long and we waited for nearly an hour for this. The items are nice and nicely presented. Highly recommended for those who want to try something that's beyond the regular fare in LV.. My wife and I live in the South End neighborhood and are going to visit The Liberty often!  They have a fantastic bar and some great food.  We initially went to sample "Charlotte's Best Burger".  I vow to update this review but based on this visit, it's a 3 star.  The burger was a great burger but was honestly far from the best.  I still would stand by the Charlotte classics at Diamond, Meullers... even newer spots like Jack Beagle's in NoDa.  A big beefy messy burger doesn't always equate to a great burger.  We will definitely return though and will update with new finds.

Update:  I have been back twice now and I have to switch to a 4 star.  The quality is just so good that I can't help it!  I had the Pub burger again and it was great, but still not the greatest in my opinion.  I have since had their Poutine Fries, more Pretzels, and tried the Caramel Salted Boudine and all was fantastic.  The fries were incredible because the gravy was not heavy, yet extremely flavorful... and the cheese was great quality and was nice and gooey through the whole dish.  The fries didn't get soggy in the dish either.  Highly recommend it!   On the menu it sounds quite unhealthy but it's just fancy cheese fries and it's a must try!  Will agree with the crowd that the service is a little bit lacking.. Cool dive. Stopped in Thusday for a drink late-night stayed till dawn. Jukebox rocks. Didn't play but saw 4 pool tables big screen TVs. Thanks to the bar tender Steve, we had a great time. Will go back. Soon.. I drove from LA to Chandler with my roommate just try the heart attack grill. Naturally I had pretty high standards. 

Heart attack grill met my wildest (and naughtiest) dreams. 
First off the decor is amazing. Outside, inside, it was just great to be there and it felt so unique. 

The food amazing. I finished the quadruple bypass in 9 minutes and enjoyed every bite. I could have eaten another double bypass but instead made a return trip to the all you can eat french fry bar. Which serves delicious fries. Plus the coke made with real sugar was delicious. Now I know why everyone from my dads generation always raves about the original coke. 

Last but definitely not least was the nurses. Between the food and the nurses I felt like I would definitely be needing mouth to mouth by the end of the experience. The nurses are very attractive and friendly. Not to mention that the uniforms are a great sight. 

I will definitely be making a return trip over the summer with more of my friends so they can experience the joy of the heart attack grill.. Awesome you won't be disappointed awesome you won't be   disappointed    just awesome you won't be disappointed awesome you won't be disappointed 
Go with a blank mind and maybe he won't be able to read it.  Ha ha ha. 
awesome you won't be disappointed
JUST GO!!!!  I would give it 6 stars if I could.. the menu was not having good looking and the prices are pretty high. I didn't shock about prices because the Lebanese cuisine is one of the most expensive cuisines in my home Kuwait. Before I went to this restaurant I was expecting certain types of Lebanese dishes such as hummus, tabouleh salad and my favorite lamb shank with rice. In my first visit to this restaurant I ordered these 3 dishes. The hummus was as an appetizer; it was perfect and got the traditional Lebanese hummus taste. The second appetizer was tabouleh salad, it was good but not perfect because it was not contain a good amount of lemon taste. The main and the last dish was my favorite lamb shank with rice. The lamb shank was extremely delicious because the lamb was very juicy and cooked perfectly but the rice was not that good. Overall the quality of food is perfect and taste original in my opinion.. With the least amount of pretension allowed by craft beer bar law, this place ranks high on my list of great beer bar destinations.  With over 60 drafts, and 350 bottles their selection covers some impressive ground.

The back bar couldn't be any simpler. Its a full length row of glass door coolers, exactly what you would expect to see along the back wall at a 7-Eleven convenience store.  (a wild fantasy 7-Eleven, but a 7-Eleven nonetheless).  These coolers are propped up a bit higher and leave the people sitting at the bar a good view of the beers offered.  

The service was great - from both of the bartenders working the bar.  It was a very busy afternoon when I was there, and they made it look easy.  Great mix of very friendly locals and tourists.

To say that I have had a few beers in my life would be a tiny bit of an understatement.  I love to try new beers, or at least beers I have never had.  At Smokin' Joe's I had Moylan's Nitro Special Bitter, Anchor Brewing's Humming Ale, 
Ballast Point Brewing's Reef Rye Brown Ale, and Elysian Brewing Company's The Immortal IPA.  I was impressed with all 4 of them, and oddly enough, most impressed with the Humming Ale.  Awesome selection.

Looking for a bit of a snack to go along with the beers, I ordered the pierogies and added the kielbasa option.  I saw them served to someone else across the bar and had to get them.  Unfortunately they were hard to find on the menu.  For some reason they are way in the back, almost listed as an afterthough.  They shouldn't be.  They were prepared just as I had hoped.  Topped with a bunch of quick high heat pan fried in butter white onions, leaving some teeth to them, but also giving some of that sweet caramelized flavor.  

There is a large flatscreen TV on the wall that separates the front and back of the room.  The screen changes showing you their list out the most recent tapped beers, the list of IPA's only, and a few others.  Great idea.

I'll be back.. Classic Vegas at it's best! David gets right in there with the audience and brings them into the show. The story telling and lead up to the illusions keep you engaged. I was surprised at his humor and thought it an added bonus to the show. Adults and children will enjoy the show and after all the guy is a legend. I highly recommend!. This place is a must!!! If you'd like to return to old school Vegas...well this is the place! Entertainment while you eat, atmosphere awesome, service, & food!!! This is a place you can talk about till your tongue falls off, but you have to be there! So...GO. I love the Mining Camp. Though I like to stay out of Apache Junction as much as possible, this is worth the trek. The atmosphere is fun and unique. The wait staff is super nice and friendly. You can't beat the all you can eat mounds of ribs and chicken that are thrown in your face. The prickley pear cactus jelly for the bread is amazing. All the food is amazing and everything is all you can eat.  The only reason that it doesn't get 5 stars is because the fact that they don't offer soda, only water and tea.. Ok. I'm very picky with food. Must People are picky about taste or texture.  Not me, I'm picky about quality. Bread is a particularly difficult one to understand from a quality perspective.  Enriched breads are linked to a condition known as leaky gut.  Basically that condition causes your gluten allergies.  conversely, whole wheat particularly sour dough has shown promissing benefits to gluten sensitivities.  In other words, the quality of your bread is critical to your digestive health.   I love the bread I buy here because its super high quality, made fresh, and the loaves I buy often cheaper than store bought.. Vdara is a true gem in Las Vegas if you're looking for a quiet escape from the madness of Vegas while being able to dive right into it if you so choose. The rooms are spacious, clean and well equipped, and you can't beat it's location - just steps from both ARIA and Bellagio. Navigating the simple, non-smokey lobby is a piece of cake, and good food and drinks are just downstairs. 

Don't get me wrong, I love staying at the casino resorts, but every once in a while it's great to take a break from their craziness, and that's when I head to Vdara.. I totally dug the layout of Pita Jungle.  I was a bit confused about what Pita Jungle wanted to be at first: Bar?  Vegetarian/Health-conscious restaurant? Central Phoenix Trendy Eatery?  I am not sure I can put my finger yet on what Pita Jungle is, but I enjoyed my experience and would be open to repeating.

My friends and I split the jalapeno and cilantro hummus and it was quite splendid.  I was a bit confused why it only came with two pitas when it was clear that two pitas would not be sufficient.  Luckily, each additional pita was only 39 cents.  Still, don't serve a dish that is not complete without paying extra.  My friends all had various other dishes that were huge portion-wise.  They all enjoyed their selections.  Service was decent.. GOod stuff.  My fiancee loved it more, but she ordered something a little more adventurious.  I think I got steak and french fries.. Our first time here. Salad, soup, eggplant, wines, bread, and on and on.
Awesome atmosphere and food.
We'll. Be back.. My wife and I wanted something simple on our last night in town and so we stopped in.  It was a great meal.  We both had the Cod and Chips.  I had a nice pint of the Burgandy Lion Ale and it was fantastic.

Next time I would like to try some of the other dishes--like the mushy peas or one of the meat pies--they all looked great.

Luckily, I didnt run into any frumpy American ladies, but I did have a nice conversation with the friendly waitress.  (The service people in Montreal are some of the friendliest I have ever met.). My wife and I love Venezia's!  Our favorite pizza place, thin NY style pizza.  They sell giant party size pizzas which are great when we have people over.. Yay for FroYo

Menchie's is another option for froyo in a crowded market. What set them apart in our visit was the strongest mix of flavors. Toppings are the standard assortment, but you have everything from Nutella to Toasted Marshmallow, to Resse's PB Cup.

Setting is open and bright. Staff are nice and seem to keep things clean. Prices are on par with other froyo places. And they have a rewards program. :o). Once again, Dragon Grille kills it at a great event at BOH Brawl lastnight. Had a quick bite to eat before the chef battle/ Always good food from Dragon Grille. Highest quality for sure- All night, couldn't even see them since there was a crowd of people surrounding them! Great job, Keep up the good work!. New York Chinese Restaurant puts me in a New York State of Mind. It serves New York style Chinese food that is out of this world.

  My past visit to their Lake Mead Boulevard location left me with an exceptional first impression of New York Chinese Restaurant. When I write exceptional first impression, I am saying that it is my contemporary favorite Chinese restaurant in the Vegas valley. With that in mind, when I hiked in Red Rock Canyon this past Saturday, I planned it so that I would try their Fort Apache location on my drive back to Henderson.   

  New York Chinese Restaurant blends into the Fort Apache landscape. Passing the southwest corner of Fort Apache at Spring Mountain, it is easy to pass New York Chinese Restaurant, which sits in a shopping center anchored by a Dollar Tree. Featuring only eight tables and a take-out environment, the restaurant itself is ordinary. Due to the fact that New York Chinese Restaurant appears to have a strong take-out business, I landed a table with ease.

  I ordered Chinese food that delivered me back to my fond memories of eating Chinese food in New York. Their chicken chow mien combination which included won ton soup, crunchy noodles, fried rice, and an egg roll was déjà vu to my taste buds. The fact that New York Chinese Restaurant includes won ton soup instead of the conventional egg drop soup made an impression on me. The New York style chow mien that they feature is a different entrée than the chow Mein served in Las Vegas Chinese restaurants.  This chow mien is vegetable instead of noodle based. Because I dislike celery, I specifically directed them to eliminate the celery. They listened and the chow mien was first-rate. 

   
  Their cold beverages are Coke beverages. It works like this. If you order a cold beverage, they give you a disposable cup. Near the counter is the Coke machine. You serve yourself as often as you want.

  When you dine in, they will deliver your food to the table and clean up after you. I feel that this service deserves a dollar tip. Most of all I feel that Yelpers deserve a bigger tip: As of the time I write this review, New York Chinese Restaurant is a first-rate restaurant specializing in New York style Chinese food that will put you in a New York State of Mind.. Great restaurant.  The pizzas are good.  The sauces are above average, while the crust is average.  My kids adore the chicken fingers.  Online ordering is very surprising, coming from a little place like this.. This place is pretty awesome.  Everything from the 90s music to the food and beer selection.

They have 30 rotating taps and probably well over 99 different bottles.

So far everything I've had on the menu is pretty good too.  I wasnt expecting much for the food after seeing the place but it was a pleasant surprise.    Food is good and portion sizes are plenty!

If this place was in Robinson, Bocktown would have some very serious competition!!

If you are in the area looking for something new, I highly advise giving 99 bottles a try!. Awesome food. This little place just sprung up a few months ago, and it looks like it is here to stay (I sure hope so at least). Maize always seems like it is busy, so I decided to try it out. Great food. I like how the burritos are prefect sized - I can eat one without feeling stuffed (unlike a Chipotle burrito, not that that is bad though). Really friendly staff, and a small bag of Chips and salsa comes with every order. The inside is small though, so if you walk in and order, be prepared to wait a little (less than 10 mins though) in a small space!

I used to be an El Charro fan, but since Maize moved in I haven't gone since... and I haven't really missed it either.

Pros: Great food. Decent prices. Friendly staff. Chips and salsa with every order. Orders don't take long (I can call an order in and by the time I walk over it will be ready!)

Cons: Small location, not a whole lot of room to wait around for your order or to sit down and eat. Really busy sometimes.. The restaurant ambiance is very nice, especially when it isn't packed to the gills and you can sit in their booth.  Very standard menu of old traditional American diner standbys, with a nice salad bar.  I would often do the soup and salad thing here.  Of special note, the milkshakes are great, probably the best in town.  That said, I must admit that the food isn't top notch and I am sometimes disappointed by their burgers, sandwiches, etc.. My family and I first dined at Da Vang when it occupied a single store front in that complex, basically where the cashier is located. Imagine the side walls up for the left half of the restaurant. It was a tiny place, that was back in '94. It's 2010, and Da Vang has grown to quite a large restaurant, and the owner's son has now taken over the family restaurant. The son used to own Phoung Huang in the former Lee Lee complex at Dobson and Southern where Asiana Market and Hodori Restaurant have taken up its space.

Da Vang is a no frills kinda Vietnamese place, yes it's dirty but I've never gotten sick and I have a very weak stomach. We usually order #18 and #19, #22, #39 or #40, #42, #43, and #44, and #50 for the egg rolls. Their wide rice noodle stirfry with seafood and egg closely resembles a Malaysian favorite of mine that's usually sold by street hawkers and that's Kway Teow. YUM! Their egg noodle soups are good and quite large, and their prices are not pricey. The restaurant itself is not in a great area, since it borders Maryvale... so it's kinda sketchy. The food makes up for the restaurant's appearance and atmosphere. It's just wholesome Vietnamese home cooking, nothing special nor fancy, a place to go for a quick bite of pho, or noodle soup, and finish it off with either Vietnamese coffee or a glass of Soy Bean Milk. Simple fare and very good too!. So am I weird if I like going to the dentist????? Not in a YIPPEE IT'S DENTIST TIME way, but it is actually a comfortable and relaxed place to be. Certainly much better than any other dental experience. 

Dr. Duresik and his staff are great. I have been a patient for a few years now. Weather it is a simple exam or something more involved Dr. Duresik takes the time to make sure I am comfortable, that I understand the procedure, and follows up after my appointment to see how I am doing! 

His staff are all equally friendly, professional, upbeat, and efficient. Providing a calm atmosphere where you can relax and let them do there job has been achieved. I'm on a first name basis with all of the staff and am greeted by each of them with a smile. 

Elisa and Theresa are great hygienist who have mastered their profession and provide a pain free experience. Jessica and Natalie have the front and back office covered with an efficiency that will have you in and out in a jiffy. 

The technology in the practice is up to date to ensure quality care as pain free as possible. It also expedites the checking in and checking out because it is all electronic. The text message appointment reminders and the friendly phone calls are a welcomed reminder of my appointment. The comfort factor of the office is a hit, the massage chairs are great, there are magazines and newspapers I actually want to read, and the daily SiriusXM station is always different. I'm waiting on WIFI access and then I'll be happy to hang out and spend more time chatting with everyone!. I love this place. People are quick to judge because this place has been here for awhile, but I am here telling you this is the best burger in Henderson. I've been to all Wildburger establishments and this one has been consistently the best. Don't get me wrong, all of them are good, but this one is the best in all of the top categories. 1)Service
Service here is great. The gals upfront always have a smile and are extremely courteous and friendly. The General Manager has been known to pop his head in and truly seems interested to know about how our food is.
2)Food
I've had the classic wildburger and I've had the boneless wings and I can safely say that the burger is top notice. The bun holds up well, nice and quality. The burger itself is always cooked exactly how I want it. The slaw the burger comes with is amazing. It really ties the whole burger together. The onion strings are the best, the presentation is awesome. Little fry baskets?! Genius! Always golden brown and delicious. 
3)Atmosphere 
The ambience here is what you would expect from any stations property. Well maintained and clean. No smoking in the restaurant, so it's nice to be able to breathe. Flat screens galore, if you want them to change the channel the server will be more than happy to do so. 
Bottom line: if you want a high quality burger, this is your place. Fast, friendly service. Ten thumbs up!. Dlux is amazing. Super close to the capital. Very good food and amazing drinks (esp old fashioned). This place gets busy quick but sitting at the bar is perfect. I highly recommend going here if ever in madison.. It was our last night out. We were going to do the classic XS as our last night, but we decided to do something different... way different. we decided to go off the strip to.... the MOON & wow we sure gambled the night right. 

Took a cab to the Palms (in case u guyz are wondering, the cab ride is fairly short from the strip... say 5-10 mins depending on traffic from the Wynn). Went up to Playboys Club and met some awesome crowd there and after a dance or two, all of us took the escalator up to the Moon.

Simply put, the place consists of two floors w/ orgasmic view of the strip. Heck, even the bathrooms, (this goes for ladies room as well) have a floor to roof window view of the strip. 

Diverse crowds. Diverse Music. And need i say retractable roof? 

This place is no size compared to a club like XS, but believe me, it is well worth a visit. 

Everyone including the ppl we met had a good crazy time
Come here and I believe YOU WILL TOO. 3.5 stars, and I am not being fair.  I have to judge though based on what I had and our experience, and unfortunately, it wasn't as good as I expected.  At the same time, I am not being fair because we did not get what we expected to get.  Let me explain...no, there is too much, let me sum up.

My girlfriend and I originally intended on coming here early in the morning, and ready to eat some big pancakes.  But for various reasons, we had to come when we did, and we were not nearly as hungry and ready to eat a huge slab of pancakes as we intended.  So we ordered things we otherwise wouldn't have gotten, and we were disappointed.

She got breakfast tacos and barely ate them - not because they weren't good, but because she just couldn't eat.  I got the "Sunset People," a scramble made with bacon, pork apple sausage, jalapenos, some hot sauce, provolone cheese, and potatoes.  It was not the best breakfast on the menu - I couldn't find exactly what I wanted to and went with something I thought I would like.  Don't get me wrong - it was okay, but it just turned out to not be what I was craving.

In the end, we didn't get any of their delicious looking pancakes or french toast or waffles.  Therefore, I don't believe I am being fair because we did not get what they specialize in.  But, I still have to review based on what I had.

On a more positive note, I did get a boozy shake - the Saturday morning fever, vanilla ice cream, buttermilk cake, baileys, kahlua and sweet cream.  It is for this drink that I am rounding up and not down.  I would come back just for another one of these.

And we will come back.  The pancakes just look too good not to try.. As I walked in the casino I didn't get the normal wall of smoke I remember so that is promising! Checked in with the cashier (Amanda) she was busy with a customer and then attended to me and got me seated right away.
 
They have Pepsi products here, so you coke lovers you "SOL" (Sh*t Out of Luck), got me a Dr. Pepper and I'm fine.

Renee was my waitress and you can tell she's been here awhile, you can just sense the wanna be here attitude. But hey we gotta survive right!?

Breakfast that was ordered was the Chuck Wagon Stampede, a lot of breakfast for the money, ordered bacon crisp and it came just how I asked, order eggs over easy and I had the option of Pancakes, Toast, or Biscuits and Gravy.

I went for the Biscuits and Gravy, they were pretty much lack luster. I'd opt for one of the other two, can't really screw up either one of the other choices.

I walked out and my clothes weren't coughing so that is a good sign they have the smoke issue under control.

I will come again, I'm sure if I make this a regular place it will increase to 5 stars as my street cred gets better in this place..... A Vivace Tale...
A long, long time ago... there was a date night.... And it went a lil like this...

Well, wasn't the best experience for a restaurant, but the positives...  The waiter was very attentive.  I think I drank about a gallon of water before we got our appetizer, which was the eggplant dip (Perfect)   He also offered a GREAT wine which complimented the meal very well!  I try for a vegan diet, which can be hard if you don't call ahead, so the options here are extremely limited, I got a cheese-less pizza ( a fail-safe at any Italian establishment) and it was more of a tasteless one.  But the company was good :)  If you make a reservation, ask for a table that's separate from the wall or not along the windows.  Awkward Turtle moment when you have to move someones purse to get to your seat on the bench as they managed to cram an extra table in.  If you get stuck at one of those tables, be prepared to have little privacy and be involved in a myriad of conversations that are going on around you.

THEY GET A 4!  So, this is an update to an earlier review, I was contacted by a few of the customer service reps and they insisted we try it again!  So, they get a star for wanting to impress us!  I'm in!  LOL, so I will definitely update this soon!  Vivace is trying for a FIVE star, and I'm looking forward to it!

Once upon a giftcard...

So, thanks to an attentive management staff, we tried Vivace again... SCORE!  It was amazing!  We took the suggestion of wine and was without a doubt, right on point!   The chef prepared a 3 course vegan meal and it was A-Maze-Ing, I got lost in the flavors!  YUM!  The appetizer was a variation of Bruscetta that was made very decadently with butternut squash and flavored with vinaigrette.  Mouth waterin' good! :)  On to the main course, was a great hodge podge of arugula, shrooms, squash, broccoli and many more that I can't remember... Let's just say I got my servings in that day!  The flavor was awesome.  dessert was really done very well as well, with apples and cinnamon in a flaky pizza dough wrap topped with raspberry syrup and powdered sugar!  Welll, hheeelllooooo there!!! 
Great job Vivace, we shall return, 

And they lived happily ever after!

:-P. Holy yum! Small selection but all the cookies are great. High prices but worth it. You will not be disappointed at all. Nothing spectacular, but no complaints. Actually one complaint. I couldn't get on the wifi. Nice heated pool and hot tub. Great complimentary breakfast - yes, they do have waffle irons, if that's what you were wondering.. Way under rated! Dang this place is good! You can taste the freshness of the ingredients. From salsas to the meats good food. 
We had the steak taco plate and the steak fajitas plate. We will be back here again!. Hmmmmm....ok service was great and informative the cheese appetizer was really good unfortunately it took awhile....the food was also great but again it took awhile...if this place was packed it would take a day for you to get your meal...lol
But they pride themselves on taking time for your meal...a European thing I quess...
Overall good enough but make sure to clean your schedule for that night. Great burger, clean location, nice staff. The single patty is enough for me- and the standard dressing is delicious. The food just tastes super fresh to me- nothing frozen. Price is right, and the fries are outstanding. I'm a fan!. This is a good family fun magic/comedy afternoon show. Nathan Burton was "made famous" by America's Got Talent, and he continues to entertain the masses in Las Vegas. I've seen his show twice at the Flamingo, and really enjoy his style of comedy and his pretty decent magic. He is a great value for families with older kids (like 8 or so and up), and is great fun for parents and grandparents alike. His show really is a family affair with his mom and sister working on the show, and he is involved in the Las Vegas community, which also makes buying a ticket just a bit easier. 
Both times I've seen him were pretty close together, but I hear he adds new bits to the show all the time, so if you have seen him once, another time won't hurt at all.. Good food with the most awsome view of the strip at night. Margaritas and Mariachi make for a great dinner spot.. Lunk Alarm!  I used to spend my better years getting jacked up and eating protein shakes like it was my job.  Then I found beer. Unfourtunately Beer had caused me to get fat and stop going to the gym.  So it was time to find a new gym to workout.  Around here I used to go to Gold's and the Y.  I personally loved the Y and it was one of the best places gyms I have been to. Though I didn't feel like spending over $55 a month.  Planet Fitness is setup exactly like most Gold's Gyms.  They also almost have the same machines.  The difference?  About $40 a month.  I have heard that you can't put much weight on the machines or the bars and this is a lie.  You can definitely rack that up.  You can do deadlifts which was another myth.  There are only 3 negatives.  Dumbells only go to 85 lbs, you cannot do lift, clean, and places, and there are no Squat racks.  It sucks there are not squat racks and probably the only thing I miss.  They do have 3 smith machines though.  

Overall great gym at a great price.  This location has a lot of equipment so you rarely have to "weight". So far after a few months I am happy.. Wow! #1 Not only does Yoscream have amazing gelato and frozen yogurt but it is by far the most beautiful frozen yogurt shop I've ever been to! Yoscream went all out with marble beautiful stone!
#2 the people working there are so friendly and helpful
#3 the price per ounce is great
#4 the toppings are amazing everything from my favorite sour worms to fresh strawberries 
#5 the shops around yoscream are fun to check out after you grab some gelato or original tart frozen yogurt(my fav)
Anyways that's my take on Yoscream. Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon after walking around.  Very peaceful and beautiful.. Ate at the Ballantyne location on a whim New Year's Eve, walked in early without a reservation, was seated promptly in the private dining rotunda room with no wait.

The food, service and presentation were all fantastic.  The maitre d' treated us like rock stars, especially my girlfriends teenaged kids, couldn't have been nicer. Our party had the portobello mushroom, shrimp cocktail and Italian sausage apps, and osso bucco, veal parm and filet mignon entrees.  Everybody loved loved loved their dishes, the kids were blown away.

I have eaten in many of Charlotte's better restaurants over the last 3 years, and I must say that Villa Antonio was among the best dining experiences I have ever had in CLT to date.

Well done.. Pita Jungle is the Pound for Pound champion of the city.  PJ packs the best food for dollar quality and quantity I know of in Phoenix.  Not only is it a great place with a lot of options, but it is inexpensive.  We ate there today and shared the hummus, got a cup of soup and the thousand bean hot pita and an iced tea at it was only $18.  That is great for any sit down, but even a better deal because the food is awesome.

The Hummus is great.  Two tips - 1. ask for a mix of all 3 flavors (same price and you get a chance to try all three) and 2. Ask for an extra pita (no extra cost) - not sure why you only get one to start since you can barely finish the plate with 2 pitas.

If you are in the mood for soup, I recommend the red lentil soup.  It is thick and go with the cup of soup vs. the bowl.  The cup is about as big as a full bowl anywhere else.  The soup has just the right texture and full of flavor and my wife simply calls it "goodness."

Salads are always a great choice and don't worry, you get a plate overflowing with food, too.  I also go with the Thousand Bean Hot Pita.  I seriously think it comes with a full 1000 beans over a bread of brown rice on a pita - very good and half the plate will fill you up.  

The only downer is that the place is pretty small and the parking lot is shared by other busy places, so at lunch you have to be a parking lot stalker to find a seat.  It is worth the wait if there is one, but they pack their food in nice to go boxes, so take out is also a solid option.. Great food, good service. Came in for a first visit and was definitely inpressed. The menu is a touch fancy but ask for a recommend item and you wont be disappointed. 

Our server Sheri was legit, ( had to ask to spell her name, and thats the only thing we needed. ) 

Even the frys are good. Soda comes in a glass bottle ( coke ) which i prefer as it is made with real sugar!  

The sauces and specials are house made, and tons of good rotating beers on draft. We will return. Came here for late drinks with a huge party so this is really about the bar service and menu.

They didn't have a huge cocktail menu but whatever they served was pretty darn good.  It's good to see that even the Cake Boss knows you gotta spice up your drinks to make people get sloshed (like we did for a big reunion party).  I had a berry mohjito that was absolutely kick ass.  The bartender was also very friendly and did a good job of making sure the drinks kept flowing.

The ambiance of this place is really nice and there's a good amount of space that can accommodate a large number of guests, making it a great meeting spot if you're part of a big party or celebration.. All i can say is good things about The Apothecary Shop.   If you visit a Holistic Doctor, they will send you to one of these types of shops.   Yes they do take insurance, but everything is a little higher.  It is located in an area between Doctor offices. A big one is the fertility Clinic. Which sends a lot of buss. their way. Loads of parking, and it is a healthy alternative. Please give it a try.. I love this place, tucked away, and I'm not sure how long it's been there. But the tacos are great and the service was fast and friendly. I highly recommend for anyone that wants great food at a reasonable price. Came to Vegas over the weekend and got a splitting hangover Sunday.  I stumbled upon this place and it was better than any gom tang in Orange County or Los Angeles.  I ordered the cold noodles and gom tang.  It was incredible.  There were so many side dishes.  Just to let you know that it wasn't because of the hang over, I went back 8 hours later and ate it again for dinner and it was still unbelievable.  Good service great prices.  Will definitely come back next time I hit the strip.. Price+quality=amazing

I love how they use a slicer to slice meats there. The bread is amazing chewy how a sandwich should be. I want one right now.  The Italian dressing homemade is amazing ask for it.. Wow.  Plain and simple.  Wow.  The Eddie Lopez pastrami burger was pure Awesome and the fries they came with were a delight.  Came in because of the yelp reviews.  Our party of nine was pleased.  I recommend the blueberry Maine root soda and the Gale's rootbeer.  I am glad there is a place like this on the west side.  I am looking forward to my next visit.  Cheers to rocket burgers and subs!. Enjoyed the exceptional food! The vegetables, sauce, and tofu blended together very, very well. The portion size was a little small so I wouldn't suggest going there if you're looking for something substantial. Otherwise it's a great spot for anything!. One of the best plumbers I've ever worked with!

Called Dan and he showed up the same day to check my clogged kitchen sink. He used the cable right away to see if he could clean it, sadly that didn't work. After deciding to use the jet, he came back the next day and was done in under an hour!

Extremely fast and super friendly! I will always recommend this plumbing company to anyone with a problem!

Would rate 6 stars :D. Wow that was good. So in January I though that it would be fun to have dinner with some friends at Joe Beef. It had been some time since I'd eaten there and I'd been hearing so many good things about the restaurant I felt it was time to go back. As the restaurant is in my neighborhood I passed by and asked to make a reservation for 5 on a Friday or Saturday night, well the first available spot was over two months away. 

For the past two months my friends and I have been anticipating our dinner, it was no disappointment. Great food, great atmosphere, great fun!

We were a group of five so we were able to sample a good amount of the menu and nothing disappointed. The portions are large and the food is very rich so sharing is a good strategy if you want to get a taste of multiple dishes. 

We started by sharing the Foie Gras Double Down - two pieces of deep fried foie gras with cheese and maple syrup in between. If you're going to share something, share this entree. I don't think that it is humanly possible to eat this and then go on to finish a main course. Other highlights from the entree list were the Eel Croquettes which melted in your mouth and the giant Baked Oysters. 

For my main dish I had the Lobster Spaghetti. Had I only had the accompanying sauce I would have been pleased. The dish was very rich, but terrific. 

Although we were all stuffed we could not resist a dessert so the 5 of us shared a beautiful looking meringue covered in raspberry sorbet, chocolate sauce and fresh mint. The meringue was so light and delicate and each of the other flavors set off a party in your mouth one after another. Even though your gut is about to burst you just can't resist having another mouthful. 

Given the decadence of their food Joe Beef is certainly not the type of place you can eat at everyday. But it is a wonderful treat. Be prepared to spend your money because nothing is inexpensive, but it is all worth it. They really do deliver a complete package, a fun experience with good food and good service. 

Enjoy!. Great cafe.  Introduced to Cortinos.  The staff is friendly and craft fine drinks.  A must visit if near convention center.. Very responsive service, fairly priced, and Levi is extremely friendly and professional. Highly recommend!. Of all the wonderful places to eat in Charlotte, this place was an instant favorite.  It has a down to earth type feel.  

The food was something else.   I've never had southern food, but as this was my first experience with it, I have to say I ow understand what all the hype is about.  After eating at this place you'll understand the meaning of "Soul Food".  Salmon cakes,corn bread, deep fried catfish, home-made butter, mac and cheese, okra and tomatoes...the stgoes on.   My mouth is watering just reminiscing about it.

The guy who waited on us was more than just a waiter.  He was friendly, funny, prompt, courteous, and attentive.  Carmela...thank you so much for taking me to this place! I had itis for the rest of the afternoon!. Best breakfast burritos in Scottsdale!  I could eat these all day.  You get what you pay for as they're stuffed full of delicious ingredients.. Was craving a gyro and decided to give this place a try. Had a couple gyro sandwiches and Greek fries (I was starving don't judge me) the fries were good not as good as everybody on yelp was saying but good. The sandwiches were pretty damn good. The servers were nice and it was fast. I'd definitely go back. I've been practicing Baptiste power yoga for six years and had the great fortune to learn at the "mother ship" Baptiste studios in Boston. When I moved from Boston to Charlotte a few months ago, I figured I would find a decent yoga spot here but that it would never compare to my experiences in Boston. Wrongo! Yoga One rocks. All of the other reviewers hit the high points--great facility (showers, lavender scented towels, enough room to move around without trading sweat with fellow yogis = yoga studio Nirvana), reasonable pricing and a great, welcoming vibe from the staff. All of that is really nice, but the true greatness here is the teachers. In the month or so that I've been going to Yoga One, I've been offered a number of meaningful insights and some really excellent assists that have helped me to deepen and improve my practice.  For me, that's the real test, the rest of the stuff is secondary. All of the instructors I've encountered are upbeat, knowledgeable, thoughtful, and clearly excited to be teaching yoga.  Finding Yoga One has been a real highlight of my move to Charlotte!. The 51s have been around for a long time already (including as the Stars) and I hope that contiues to be the case for another long time.  I like going out the the games a couple of time a year at least.  The pricing is right for an affordable night out.  While they don't always win when I am there and they don't always perform well over the duration of the season, they always put on a good show.  And when they do win it is extra special.  The last game I went to ended with a score of 19-2 for the Las Vegas 51s over the Reno Aces.  That was a rather convincing win.  It was good to see the home town boys do so well.  I hope they can keep it up all season.  That would be great to see.. Finally Tempe has a breakfast spot.  Snooze clearly prides itself on being more than just an eatery.  Great food, atmosphere, and SERVICE!  Highly recommend the corned beef hash and danish blueberry pancakes!  Every member of the staff was dancing and smiling, again, truly an enjoyable experience.. Had a nice lunch here :) Smoked turkey sandwich was delicious and the soups were tasty. Good service and atmosphere.. Arturo, Marcos#2and Erick did a great job!! This company was recommended by a friend and he raved about their quality of work and we were not disappointed. They were courteous, hard working and very careful with all of our items! We would recommend this company to anyone who is moving and wants peace of mind with using a moving company!!. The reason I give this place 5 stars is because of the service. I've always been leery about ordering water as some places require you spend money. I went in solely to catch some march madness and, when I was served water I offered two dollars and the server told me not to worry about it. He was very cool and civil with me. So I then asked for a menu and ordered oysters. He explained the two types, east coast and west coast stating the latter were creamier and more expensive. I ordered east coast and he put one west coast on there for free. I believe his name was Luke. Anyway, he was a very cool and down to earth guy and really made me want to spend my money there. Oh and the oysters were very good. 

I've been to this establishment before for various events associated with Global Pittsburgh. It's particularly nice summer time as it is open to the outside and in general is a good place for larger groups to gather and mingle. 

In regards to my most recent visit, the friendliness of the service and how the aforementioned staff member made an effort to accommodate me and make me feel welcome fully warrants this rating and as a result, I can see myself returning and providing them business in the near future.. For so many years I've been going from McCarran to downtown in only one of three ways. Limo, taxi, or rental car. I'd heard about the bus, but never considered taking it downtown. 

So when I heard the WAX only charged two bucks to take you from the airport all the way down to Fremont Street, I was skeptical to say the least. But it's legit. For less than the price of one dish of Golden Gate shrimp cocktail, you get timely and comfortable service from LAS to FSE.

It's quick and easy to find, right outside baggage claim on the lower level. Same place you'd get your limo, if you reserved one. Just walk a little farther across the street towards the parking garage. You'll see the bus parking spots. Head off to your right and you'll see signs.

The WAX is a nice, clean, and spacious bus. Typical RTC transit vehicle. Just picture what you ride on from the McCarran Rental Car Center and you won't be surprised. And at $2 for a one-way trip all the way downtown, at almost the same speed as a taxi, it simply can't be beat.

And here's a little secret. Once aboard the bus, head way to the back to either the extreme right or left. There, you'll find a secret luggage stashing area (see photo). Just behind the perpendicular-facing seats in front of you is a space large enough for almost any carry on luggage. I was able to easily fit my entire roller bag behind there.

There you go. A special tip just for you. No charge.

I was almost alone on the bus at 6:00 pm on a Sunday evening. And it doesn't make too many stops. You just pick up a few tweakers near NY NY, hop onto I-15, then a few more stops near the Outlet Mall up north, and you're suddenly downtown.

The WAX drops you off at a very convenient location, at 4th and Carson (directly across from The D's main entrance). From there, it's an easy walk anywhere on Fremont. 

There really is only one disadvantage to this way of travel. Departure times. You have to time them just right. The bus only departs about once per hour, every hour. Other than that, this is the way to go.

I may not take my date this way as she looks best in a limo. But if I'm alone, it's the WAX all the way.. Location, location, location. This resort is in the heart of north Scottsdale and walking or free shuttle distance to Kierland Commons shopping and restaurant plaza. The rooms are well kept, spacious, pleasing decor, and separate shower and tub. Great place for a romantic getaway. The pools are beyond incredible for families with beach entrance, slides, wave machine, lazy river, live music/activities during the summer months, and a large adult only pool.. You sunk my battleship!!!! Those of you that have eaten here will get that.Good food and reasonably priced. I have only tried the Spicy Noodle B4 as it's my constant go to. So good!! Tis the weather for a good bowl of soup thus is the time of year to come to the Noodle Man, they have non-soup dishes too.. but you will have to read other reviewers to get the feel for that stuff. The place is well decorated and extremely clean. Parking is a pain in the g-maximus.. My new go to spot in vegas!

This place is awesome from the food to the customer service it was an awesome experience.

During a recent getaway myself and my girlfriend enjoyed an array of items on their menu.

Muscle boy breakfast = straight and forward everything was cooked my liking and delicious

thai monster w/ brown rice = delicious and highly curious on to whats in their peanut sauce marinade

steak breakfast burrito = best thing ever (keep in mind ive been on a chicken rice diet for the past few weeks so red meat was like crack at this moment) it was like the perfect helping of red meat and egg whites. 

gf had the salmon salad at that too was crazy flavorful and delicious.

we also tried a peanut butter protein smoothie = OH GOD (bigseanvoice) i seriously need to figure out how to make that thing.

While we were waiting the manager noticed our anxiousness and decided to have us try out some samples of a new smoothie they were working on. Its little aspects like this that really give an impression on the type of business theyre running. Even the busboys were nice to even see how our experience was when he picked up our plates. 

my only want would be a macro count on their menu cause im very curious to see the calorie count/macro ratios on some of their items.. Their new location is better laid out then the old one but the customer service is always top notch. Been coming here for years every Friday for our traditional "Comics and Coffee (at very nearby Cartel Coffee Lab) Friday "!. Wonderful service and the most delicious authentic Italian food in Montreal!  Don't skip the dessert.   The basil sorbet is amazing. You need to eat here.. Met the owner of this chain in one of the other locations once. Nice guy and it shows in the restaurants. Staff is always more than friendly, quick personal service that you would hope to find in other "sit down" eateries. Expectations are always exceeded for me at this location and it is why I pass others to go to this spot.  The $5.00 Big Carl Combo is the best deal in town and the service is icing on the cake.. Obviously this wasn't built a Starbucks. It's more spacious than your average 'bucks, and has a cool little game room tucked away with a table to seat 8 or so. A few gents were playing chess while we were there.

Lots and lots of seating is available, although lots of it is taken by people working away on their computers. The customer service is excellent.

I had my first Fizzio (root beer). It was unexpectedly really good! Has a tinge of ginger in it, and with whipped cream on top it has a creamy aftertaste. I'm not a huge fan of cold coffee, so this might become my go-to cold drink.. Great food and menu selection.  My wife loves the mini-lobster pot pie!   A little on the pricey side at times -- but another outstanding dining experience.. Upscale but...
My wife and I celebrated our 35th anniversary last night at The Capital Grille.
The food was excellent. We had both the lobster crab cakes and shrimp cocktail for appetizers. Very delicious. Just the right spice and temperature. For our main course my wife had the salmon and I had the night's special steak. My wife enjoyed her salmon but did have to add salt which I found a bit unusual since she rarely does that. My steak was cooked to perfection and our sides of Sam's mashed potatoes and asparagus were also prepared to our liking.
I can find nothing but great things to say about the quality of food.
The only thing keeping me from giving me The Capital Grille five stars is the service. It struck us as being rude when we were at the reception station and the host told one of the wait staff to "go sit these two". Not really what I was expecting from a place such as this. Our waiter was "Ok". Nothing special. He was semi-attentive but as we were having our first sips of our after dinner drinks he brought us the check. Really? Do you want us to leave or do you want us to sit and spend some more money.? It was Halloween and its not like the place was slammed full. 
Call me picky but if I am dropping $250 for dinner then I would expect that the service equal my expectations.
I do want to give The Capital Grille a big Thank You for going the extra step of setting up our table for our anniversary. My wife was thrilled. Thank you!. Whenever I'm asked about FROYO, I never turn this opportunity down.  A couple of us came here after a BBQ.  I'm super surprise to discover this place and location.  I always thought the location did not contain a lot of cool businesses, but so not the case.

Island Frozen Yogurt Bar is like Yogurtland.  You choose the size cup, the flavors of yogurts and toppings.  You are charged by the weight of your cup in the end.  The store has a few tables for seating.  There's an arcade in the back.  There's also an area that looks like a candy shop.  

It definitely hit the spot today.  The great part is that it's so close to where I live, so you know I'll be back!  Very soon :). Really some of the best pork I've had. Very moist, flavorful, and juicy. The taste without the sauce was excellent. I honestly thought the BBQ sauce took away from the pork flavor. 

Cole slaw was not good, and the Mac and cheese was very so-so, but based on the excellent quality pork sandwich I will give it five stars.. On a recent trip to Las Vegas, we rode in a Nellis Cab Company vehicle to our hotel from the ariport.  Being visitors we had no idea that we were being overcharged by the dirver...and he alone not the company.....until we took a return cab drive a few days later from the same hotel back to the airport.  The difference between the two fares amounted to approximately $20.  

We wrote the cab company complete with all the details and our receipts explaining what had happened.  In a short two weeks, we received a lovely letter from their Human Resource Manager and a FULL refund for the trip!  Obviously the management of this company cannot be with every driver all the time...but their actions exemplified to us that they are indeed a very reputable company!  I 'd use them anytime!
Peter Foley. I went here last night for my birthday dinner, and I was extremely happy with the entire experience. The biggest plus for me, aside from the food that is, was the waitstaff. All of the servers were very friendly and professional, and I could tell they all looked out for each other. Case in point, I noticed some lint on one of my glasses of wine, and before I could even say anything, one of the other waiters saw me studying the glass and quickly came over and offered to replace it.

Speaking of wine, the selection was great, but I was unfortunately relegated to the limited "wine by the glass" menu since I was the only red wine drinker at my table. Even so, the selection of wine by the glass was well-rounded and pretty solid, and our waiter's wine recommendations were spot on. Now, for the food!

Bread and olive oil is complimentary, of course, and very tasty (so simple...but so good!). For starters, we ordered the crab cakes as well as a spring salad with walnuts and gorgonzola, both of which were very good. For my entree, I had the roast duck, which came with fingerling potatoes, red cabbage, spring vegetables. The entire dish was fantastic. Moist duck, perfectly cooked vegetables, and a wonderful sauce that had blueberries in it. A simple dish done very, very well.

In all, Timpone's is a great place for a gourmet meal at a pretty decent price. They have a nice selection of veg-friendly dishes, too (not vegan, however). I can't recommend this place enough. Give it a try!. Went to Restaurant Sinaloa with my wife today.  Usually this is the kind of place we would drive right past and not pay attention to.  We did this many times for this restaurant.  Well today we went to this place for dinner.

My wife ordered the arroz marinero (seafood rice).  I ordered the coconut shell cocktail of shrimp, oysters, and octopus.  Both were very good.  My wife and I were impressed.  We will definitely return here.  

Do not let the outside of the building or the neighborhood put you off.  This is a place that we want to do well and stay in business.. gutes essen, nette bedienung!

die plätze im freien sind zu empfehlen (geräuschpegel, geruch etc.) 

ein solides burger und slow/fast-food restaurant das so manchen american diner alt aussehen läßt!. Fantastic Espresso here.  You can certainly taste how fresh it is.  Aside from the coffee though, the place appears to be over run with "I'm too cool for school" hipsters, tattoos and nose piercings to boot.  I can handle a few dirty pretentious hipsters here and there, but not sure if I need a joint full of 100 of them.  Will be back for the java, but will probably get it to go.. Moodswings was great!!!!! It was exactly what I wanted!!! They were very prompt and on top of things. I had an appt for 5:45pm and I was seen right on time! It was amazing. 

My stylist was Julz!!! She was great. She cared and did what I wanted with my hair not what she thought. She was amazing at fades which most people aren't. I am very very very happy with my cut. Also she paid attention to how I wanted my hair styled and not just a quick style before I left. She styled with product I was interested in and did my hair the way I liked it. 

And the hand massage was amazing!!!! Over all, it was an amazing location, great space, amazing energy and just all around I was energetically happy!. Awesome. Awesome awesome awesome. The balcony was obviously phenomenal, the place did not require bottle service, and the wait wasn't too bad. Obviously you can't bitch and moan about prices if you're going to a trendy club/lounge, but this place definitely delivered. 

Then again, I'm not a Vegas regular, just a visitor. My budget might have been slightly more for a night out than a resident.. $21.95 (dinner) for all you can eat, and they really mean it.   We sat at the sushi bar and got to order as many of their premium sushi rolls as we wanted which were freshly prepared.  The sushi chef continued asking all through dinner if we wanted something else.   We also got to order hot food directly from our waitress, who provided quick and excellent service.  Even dessert was included.  Wish we had a sushi place like this in San Diego.. You're not going to find an experience like this anywhere in Las Vegas. Anywhere for that matter. I THINK: These people come to work wondering what they can do to make your dinner an 'all out experience.' I've eaten there like 12 times already. Maybe it's because my name is Marc and they just like me more than anyone else in the world? I don't know the reason.

Last night I just suggested that I had time on my hands and wanted something unique. They went back and brought me out a taste of something called Chicken Riggies and not only did I order it I fell in love with it. 

I've traveled the world as a computer officer on cruise ships (Crystal Harmony and Crystal Symphony), been to well over 100 countries and I've eaten in some of the worlds nicest restaurants with some of the best food being on board our ships. Here is my review IF I HAD TO PICK ONE RESTAURANT TO MARRY, HAVE AND TO HOLD FORSAKING ALL OTHERS UNTIL DEATH ---- THIS IS IT!!!. This place was awesome. First time i had heard about it and will definitely be coming back. Brought some friends with me from up north and they couldn't get enough of the sweet tea and cheesey buns. The staff was excellent with my kids. I could see this place being tough to get into around race weekend for sure. Prices aren't too bad either. You definitely get what you pay for and then some.. This place was awesome....seated very quickly.no waiting. Sonny our cook was friendly and funny.
I did a sake bomb and the made a 7up with syrup for my son(non alcoholic). My 3year old cried during the fire parts. But had a great time. The food taste soooo goood. We will make sure we come again and again.. The atmosphere is classy and fun . Always love the food the spice can be a little hot. Pepsi served in bottles, no free refills. Brought my girls and thought it was not very kid friendly.. By far the best car dealership I have ever had to deal with. I bought a 2012 VW Passat TDI there in March from Daniel. It was an excellent experience! He was extremely knowledgable, helpful and not the least bit pushy. I live in the east valley and I commute to have any and ALL work done on my two VW's in Peoria because of how great this dealership is. Period. Thanks Lunde's.. I would come here everyday if I could. Really delicious. Very friendly staff. Great concept. Not a whole lot to say about high quality shaved ice except to be careful since it's easy to become an addiction! Also the ring game on the patio will drive you mad if you give it long enough lol. 

I hope to see more places like this pop up around town. It's great we are employing young people in a fun environment. Enjoy your sno! :)

I want to mention that I had a small issue in the past with getting the wrong flavor. I posted a review and the owner, Jeff, reached out to me about it immediately to resolve it. How refreshing to see someone take their clients' opinions that seriously. #fanforlife. This place is great...  A buddy and I had a wonderful experience at Hennessey's.  

We had a waitress named Nikki and she was absolutely amazing.  This girl was just hilarious AND we were grateful that she was knowledgeable about the menu... helping us vegetarians navigate it with ease.   She was beautiful, sure, but she was SUPER witty... which was a relief after the rather dull service we had gotten throughout Vegas earlier in the week.  I'm telling you, if you go to Hennessey's and you get Nikki as your waitress (whether you're a boy or a girl), your experience will be elevated!

I had a veggie burger and fries... not bad.  Food and drinks were quite inexpensive.  The meal was followed by a shot with our waitress.  My only criticism of the place is the surprise I had to see a bathroom attendant in the bathroom.  I've dealt with restroom attendants a few dozen times but it just seemed strange to have one in a Irish bar in Vegas.. Was in town for a recent sporting event and read good things about Ds. A bit off the beaten path, but an easy bus ride from my Oakland hotel (and bus originates from Downtown, so should be easy ride from there, too).

Ds did not disappoint: creative craft beer list of 25+ taps, plus hundreds of bottles in the Beer Cave that you can have onsite or take to-go, and some of the best dogs I've ever had. Was there on a Friday, so got the Scorpion (cheddar jalapeno kielbasi) & fries deal for $5.50--excellent. Also tried the very good Ds Brat (cheesy bratwurst) & fries (same price), and they do a terrific version of the Chicago Dog. There are also 20+ toppings options if you want to DIY. Nice, friendly service from the guys behind the bar/in the kitchen made this a fine time.

Next time I'm in PGH, Ds will be at the top of my list to visit. Can't wait to try their other dogs and whatever they have on tap (or in the Cave).

P.S. There is also sit-down service in a room between the bar and Cave that seemed more family-friendly. I noticed several tables had pizzas and burgers, so I assume those are decent, too.. You have not lived until you have ate KoMex!!! I use to eat at the Decatur location ALL the time and I am super excited that this new location is less than a mile away now! That can be either good or bad :-/ it's not the most healthy food but it for sure hits the spot every time! Tonight I placed a to-go order which seems to be the more efficient and time effective way to get your food without much of a wait! I do know that they are a fresh to order kind of place so it's not like you can walk in and anything on the menu is already prepared! Tonight I ordered the Bulgogi quesadillas and the musubi with spam and a fried egg! Delicious! I usually get the Bulgogi fries but tonight I switched it up! This place is a MUST! If you're looking to order a cocktail they do have a bar in this location which is most definitely a PLUS! Go KoMex!. I called for information about telex and they answered all my questions! I paid 109 and I am all set. Pricila is very helpful and I'm glad they are helping me!. Great selection of beer, a simple menu with options out of the ordinary, and excellent service.  Can't recommend this place enough.. A perfect way to top of an exotic shopping experience at 99 Ranch.  The Taiwan Express has photos of many (not all) of their dishes. Very authentic.  

Also try some shaved ice for desert (brought me back to Singapore!).  My kids love the shaved ice, though they are more used to Asian foods than most kids.  

Note that the Buffet section (to the left) is better than any mall food courts, and may be more tame for some taste buds.  

AND - in between the buffet and Taiwan Express you can buy a whole roast duck for about $12.50, which they will cut up for you.  Be sure to buy some Plum Sauce (elsewhere in the store) for a sweet dipping sauce for the duck (yummy!).. My absolute favorite new restaurant anywhere.

The beer selection is awesome, and the menu is well thought out.

Poutine + Foie Gras = Stupid Amazing

My steak was cooked and seasoned to perfection, and the greens were perfect to cleanse the pallet between each morsel of meat.

I'm only in town for a week, but I'm definitely going back--probably tonight.. Just a neat place. Celebrated national vodka day there. Casey the barkeep made a special vodka drink in honor of it! Just overall fun and relaxing. Outdoor bands are special under the stars.. Those meals that are so good that you want to close your eyes with every bite. Heaven! Beautiful food. Beautiful setting. Perfect to be outside and soak it all in!

The pork tacos and quinoa salad were perfect. 

Jessa is the best! Trust her suggestions and you will have a great meal. I told her this was my favorite culinary experience! Thanks again if you are reading this :). Played the Blue & White courses this morning with a group of 30 golfers. We all thought the courses were very nice, fair but not too difficult. Fairways were in very good shape, greens a little bumpy but not too bad. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Most of our group said that they would love to play there again. Thank you to Clay in the pro shop for the excellent service.. The best juice place I've discovered in the Phoenix area.  Everything is cold pressed within a day and comes in a variety of flavors.  Many times juices can be incredibly difficult to swallow but these are all surprisingly tasty.

The staff is knowledgeable and willing to spend quite a bit of time with you answering questions or developing your own program.  

The word is starting to get out which leads to them occasionally running out of juices.  It's best to go in the morning to be assured of getting the juices you want.. Hard to imagine. Great quality, awesome service, reasonable prices, in LAS VEGAS at a chain? Yes! Maggiano's. I don't know what else I can say. The ambiance was country club. Menu selection was Superb.

OK it wasn't a quiet little bistro. it's located on LV Blvd. In Fashion Show shopping center. But the food is good and you can easily splurge on the wine or drinks, and still save a ton over the big name places, eg. Batali's B&B, etc.. This may be my favorite restaurant in the world. The flavors you discover sitting at your table here are amazing and the staff is amazingly kind and attentive. I've eaten her twice now and will be back many more times. The yellowtail with jalapeno is a taste delight.. Best tacos in Vegas. Been countless times and I can't stop. Al Pastor taco's are a must have for sure and to be honest is what I usually get so I can't give to much insight on the list of other tacos. The Carne asada tacos and fries though are also amazing. I know my Mexican food and promise you it won't disappoint. 

If you want something quick, authentic and delicious then this is the spot. Good prices, quick service (although there is often a large line), and delicious food. Both locations are at par to me so don't be shy by this ones location next to a gas station.. We have some pretty good Mexican food choices here in Casa Grande.  We were delighted to discover Red is our new favorite.  The food was excellent and the wait staff friendly and courteous.  We've always liked the intimate setting of this building in its prior occupancies and wish the new management great success.. Having frequented this Indian numerous times, and tried plenty of the wannabes this is the place to eat, authentic Indian all the way, if you want HOT it will come HOT and SPICEY, not your pretend hot meals. Excellent knowledgeable staff who take your order, if you want MILD you'll get MILD, If you want to test what your made of, get HOT.
    Quite simply NO BETTER INDIAN in the Phoenix area.. Picked up a suit in Phoenix & needed some quick alterations before a wedding.  She had no problems hitting the deadline and even removed the tags of my jacket for me eventhough I ended up having nothing done to it! Just a nice little shop and happy to recommend her.. The best food ever! Get fried chicken and waffles. Come hungry too. You will wait maybe a hour to eat. Don't be on a diet if you come here. Yum !!!!!. I rarely use the word "awesome" to describe anything but I was left with that feeling after spending three hours at Shelby American Saturday June 13, 2015.
The facility is immense, clean and inviting. It is about 5 minutes driving time from the Mandalay Bay, plenty of parking. Souvenirs at reasonable prices.  Everyone there is friendly and enthusiastic. If you are, or at some time in the past, were, a car nut, this is the place for you, whatever marque appears on your baseball cap, tee shirt or keychain. 
There is an assortment of cars on the floor that takes you through the history and career of the fabulous and interesting man Carroll Shelby was. 
Gratis, mind you, GRATIS, is a one to two hour tour. Ours was given by Jim King, a 50 year Ford and SA veteran who, is friendly approachable and, dare I say it, fascinating. Jim stood in front of each car on the floor and told its story and how it wove into the racing passion that took place in America in the 1960's, and how this passion stretched across the pond to involve Ferrari and the 24 Hours of LeMans. Even my wife, who couldn't tell a Cobra GT from a Grand Torino was taken by the tale Jim wove. 
After a discussion about the cars he took us into the shop (it was Saturday so there was no work in progress) and explained in detail the process you might go through to obtain any number of cars being produced by Shelby American today. 

Classy Place. From what I know of him, Carroll Shelby would be proud. 
Post Script - Jim referred me to a book that details America's foray into International Endurance racing "Go Like Hell" by A.J. Baime 2009. Available on Kindle and in Paperback on, where else? I just finished it.. When folks come to Vegas I believe what they seek is an experience.   Whether it's a show, their hotel, the casino, people watching or the food.  Hugo's Cellar excels for a food experience!  The ambience is what I imagine was typical for old-school Vegas, a place for regulars with, ahem, "connections".  The wait staff is attentive and professional without being in the way.  Carlos is a fine waiter and Diego kept our water glasses full.  Then there was Victor.  At Hugo's they make each diner a salad to their specifications from a table side salad station.  Victor was the salad guy.  But he was so much more.  Victor was the story guy, and the "tell it like it was" guy, and the guy who embodied the ambience of Hugo's.  The name over the door read "Hugo's Cellar", but it could have easily read "Victor's Place".

Our party of 8 dined for close to 3 hours.  Mine and my wife's bill was around $170 for two entree and two martinis.  Expensive? You might think so.  You could think of it as comparable to two tickets to a Vegas show with a free steak meal.  I think of it as a Vegas experience and well worth it.. Alors ce resto est idéal pour les Brunch, il se trouve en face d'un autre établissement ou il y a en moyenne 1h30 de queue et je pense qu'il récupère la clientèle qui ne veut pas attendre comme nous. Bon il faut tout de même attendre un peu car c'est pris d'assaut et de ce fait nous avons du attendre 20 minutes !

Le patron à été super cool et il booste les serveuses pour qu'elles débarrassent rapidement les tables pour que d'autres personnes puissent profiter du brunch.
Une fois installé il est difficile de choisir tellement il y a de choses sur la carte. J'ai pris une assiette avec du pain perdu, des saucisses du bacon et d'autre truc. En plus de cela j'ai eu le droit à des pommes de terre ainsi que des fruits. Il y avait dans cette assiette largement de quoi manger surtout qu'il faut rajouter le bagel et tous cela arrosé de sirop d'érable (enfin pas sur la viande).

Vu que nous avions les yeux plus grand que le ventre nous avions décidé de prendre aussi une assiette dessert : banane/ nutella et pain perdu !! Autant vous dire que quand tout est arrivé nous étions 3 à nous demander comment on allait manger tout cela. Mais je vous rassure on a tout mangé.

Finalement on a passé un très tres bon moment dans un restaurant bien sympathique (certes un peu bruyant) et avec des hôtesses plus ou moins souriantes mais vu le monde présent je peux comprendre. En plus de cela les tarifs étaient vraiment intéressants.. Very friendly as I entered. Shop totally dedicated to the RC hobby. Limited paint selection focusing on lexan.. Here is why this gets the Five Starts:

1. Independently owned with the owners actually there working
2. Authentic German Food done VERY well
3. Amazing staff that understand the menu and doesn't make fun of you for pronouncing anything wrong.
4. LARGE outdoor bier garden in historic downtown Glendale
5. Das Boot - You can get a real German bier in a large Glass Boot.
6. Best from scratch pretzel you could ever dream of. 

The overall atmosphere is one that is just fun and very different from anything else I've found in the Valley.. Yes, it's a hole-in-the-wall and hard to get to.  It's also fantastic food at a great price.  I will definitely go back.  The Serrano Dinner was fantastic.. We come here for the amazing yummy Salads! Huge portions and definitely enough to share.   Today we had the gluten free pesto chicken pizza.  Crazy good! Nice to find gluten-free options :)

Very fast service so great on a lunch break!. Really fun place to gamble. The tables have good limits and the atmosphere was great. They play live music and the crowd seemed to really enjoy it. Had some good luck here and wish I could have played longer, but it was already 4am. I would go back here.. Killer sandwiches and dill potato salad that set my world on end.

I wish I had known of Bertha's while I was in town for a long period of time because I would have eaten here everyday.  

I went for the blue cheese roast beef sandwich which was a magical meal.  Lightly toasted bread, slightly sweet mustard mayo, fresh veggies and the most beautiful sliced roast beef I have seen in a long time, this sandwich was nothing short of awesome, damn it was good.  

As a side I got the dill potato salad, this stuff is NOT your grandmothers potato salad, this is what your grandmother should have been giving you.  Holy wow, creamy dill potato greatness.  I am going to have to figure out how to get this out to me in LA.

The deserts looked great and the little chocolate brownie cookie gave me an idea of how good the other offerings most likely are.

Bertha's is awesome, fresh sando's, salads, wraps and potato salad that will redefine the potato.  Bertha's please open a location in LA, I will keep you afloat!. Very. Good brisket, quest, and burger. The ambiance is very dark but pleasant. There is a good sound system and entertainment many nights. There is a nice dance floor for when dancing is available; most of the recorded music is certainly good for dancing county and western.. The food is alright, but for the buffet price I will eat alright food over and over.  The lunch buffet is full of great food, with hot milky chai and multiple chutneys included.  The restaurant isn't clean, sometimes they take awhile to refill the steam trays, and it's kind of loud.  But it's cheap and decent.  Best way to fill yourself up on a cold day on the east end.. If you spend much time looking through reviews of Vegas hotels a motif of sorts emerges pretty quickly...

"who cares about the room?"

"but it's just for sleeping in a couple of hours so who cares?"

"I don't spend any time at my hotel so I don't care if it sucks!"

What these people fail to recognize, I fear, is that it is precisely this dearth of expectation that provides for such a low standard.  And where exactly do these people relax after a day of walking those endless casino-miles?  Where do they get ready to go out for the night?  Where indeed do they get their freak on?

The prevailing wisdom asserts that the hotel room is the LEAST critical measure of enjoyment as pertains to the successful Vegas getaway.  I am here to disabuse you of any notion that the party-line is worth your penitent regard.  From where I sit your hotel room is by far the MOST important decision you will make when plotting your Sin-City sojourn.

Easy for me to say, of course, because from where I sit is in my room at the Mandarin Oriental hotel.

Located on the periphery of City Center, right on the strip, the MOLV is your quiet and civilized oasis.  Calm.  Serene.  Tranquil.  Beautiful.  

Expensive.

Yeah it costs more than a few extra dollars to stay here, so if you're hoarding your readies to flay the stickmen at the craps table then perhaps the IP is a better option.  But to my mind, that money is far better-spent on the tasteful luxury and warm, welcoming atmosphere afforded to the lucky traveler who rests his head here.  You will want for nothing.  You will not spend 40 minutes checking in.  You will not have to navigate a crowded and smoky casino to access your room.

I admit it.  The Mandarin has spoiled me for every other hotel on the strip.  Even options I had considered "a step up" in the past now seem hopelessly dreary.  But on a recent visit the tariff for my room was only 20 bucks more a night than what was surely a cramped shoebox at the sprawling and cacophonous MGM Grand.

Another perk...  after inquiring of the doorman how far a walk it was to the Cosmopolitan he responded with an estimate of 5-10 minutes or so, but if i could wait 5 minutes the house car would be available to drive me to my destination.  Hmmm.... walk or be driven there in the back of a chauffeured Mercedes.  Yeah, not such a tough call, there.

So look. You can take your chances at mandalayexcaliburcircuscircuswynnmiragepalacestationpolotowersballagio or wherever else the hoi-freaking-polloi is congregating.  You will save yourself money, but what you give up, to me seems far more dear.  Do yourself a favor.  Care about something.  Be good to yourself.  See you there.. Fast, friendly service.
Awesome sushi.
Not too shabby price.. FREE CHICKEN at Fry's?  How Can you Get Yours  "if fry's marketplace is out of chicken you get a free chicken on your next visit.  

Here's the story,
As i walked up to get my 8 piece friend chicken at the frys on McDowell, I saw they were  out of friend chicken.  This guy comes over and says "I can't wait got get a free chicken", i was like what are you talking about?  but tell me more. 

He explained, "Free Chicken Guarantee, between  certain hours one can get a free chicken coupon if they don't have any ready for you.  The store manager was called and gave me us each a coupon to use later for a free 8 piece chicken.  see posted photo of coupon.

There is a large sign is behind the counter that explains the simple guarantee from the CEO. don't believe, check it out yourself. I used to work here in the Forum Shops and was one of those anticipating for Carmine's to open and finally got to try them out last week. I came here with a party of 11 to celebrate my aunt's birthday. I must say my aunt and her family are from NY and have eaten at the Carmine's there, so the expectations were set pretty high. I do love the inside of the place especially how the high raised ceilings have all sorts of pictures hanging on the walls. If only the restaurant was in a stand alone building then it would truly give that Manhattan feel. Before anything was served we noticed that the plates were at the end of the table, my aunt expected the server to place each plate in front of us because that's what the server did in NY. It didn't happen, so I guess here it's more of a self serve concept. My beverage of choice was the strawberry lemonade since another review mentioned how good and tart it was. She was right I did enjoy the tartness(tasted similar to Red Robbin's Freckled Lemonade), too bad it's not free refill because I sure did finish that drink before the food was served.

So here is the break down of the food:

Carmine's salad- I liked all the additional toppings in this salad like berries, nuts, and salami if I remember correctly. We had 2 salads and assumed they were the same because they looked very similar. After tasting both we realized the other one was a mixed green salad. I prefer Carmine's salad and say it's worth the $3 difference. 

Calamari- pretty standard, wasn't too greasy and the breading was like how I've had it at other Italian restaurants.   

Zuppa Di Clams (white)- I am not a fan of clams but my brother convinced me to try the last piece and I was pleasantly surprised. If you enjoy clams I definitely would recommend this dish, pretty delicious I must say. The sauce for the clams was so good we saved it to put on our pasta.

Broiled porterhouse steak- this was really delicious and I thought it was perfectly cooked with various pieces being rare and medium (refer to the picture). One of the better cuts of steak I've had from a restaurant. Warning this is pricey, costing $80.

Chicken Scarpariello- I read from another review recommending this dish and when we ordered it the server said they were out?! I was shocked at first because I've never heard of a chicken dish running out at a restaurant. Thankfully she came back and said they still had it. It was cooked in a buttery sauce, probably my favorite dish of the night and reasonably price. I will definitely order this the next time I come back. 

There was a pasta dish we ordered but I can't remember what the name was. Next time I come, I'll also order the Rigatoni & Broccoli as recommended by another yelper. According to my aunt and her husband the food was a little on the salty side, but still a good quality in comparison to the one in NY. However the service was lacking. I really want to come back but it probably won't be any time soon. This place was pricey so I'll have to find a special occasion to come here for.. chicken was great! a little pricy for a combo with fries coleslaw and drink but you get really good food for the money. the chicken tasted fresh and was perfectly fried. it also tasted very healthy. it wasnt dripping in oil. will go back just for some strips next time im in vegas.. So it's a Dentist office so automatically I went there under high anxiety.  Something about having metal utensils and fingers in my mouth is just unsettling to me.  Fortunately, the staff here are very welcoming and great to be a patient for.  They explain every step and procedure and while they take their jobs seriously, they have a laidback and casual approach to things.. This used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant, but it closed down thanks to the crappy Bamboozle Club that opened in the same plaza. Phoenix residents wouldn't know a good Chinese restaurant if it bit them in the a__!. I was very impressed with the value that this restaurant provides.   It was also a great venue for a family with small boys as they were able to move around.  Price was unbeatable at $12.85/adult with a large choice from the buffet:  Japanese sushi, crab legs, spicy crab, chinese dishes like spicy chicken, orange chicken, spicy string beans, a mongolian stir fry station with kalbi cooked to order, oysters on the half shell, etc   The food was pretty good on all counts-certainly wasn't Bellagio quality-but it was very tasty and an incredible value.. Confession Time. Authentic Mexican food places intimidate me. I am very interested in trying out new things but rarely do because of the language barrier. The staff at Taco Taco are the nicest most helpful staff I have ever had at an 'over the counter' restaurant. My first time in they took the time to explain the entire menu and let me sample all the different meats. It was a great experience. I settled on soyrizo.

The food is excellent. As a confused white guy I think of Taco Taco as a chipotle style establishment with real Mexican tastes. I make a point to stop by and try something new whenever I am on the east side.. I live next to AZ Mills Mall and have been going to this location since Ricky started there a few years ago. I used to go to to the location at Chandler Fashion Center until I had a bad highlight experience.  Then Ricky took over as manager there and I was blown away by his professionalism and talent, when he came to AZ Mills I was thrilled. I prefer him to cut my hair but if he's not available or I'm in a hurry any of the other staff do an amazing job. I've never had a bad haircut or highlights at the AZ Mills location.. Wow. Family owned. Everything made fresh and it taste like it. I ate way too much. Great great quality food. Super friendly staff. We are the buffet. A little expensive but worth it because of the quality.. Took my girlfriend for her first Pho experience and she loved it. The spring rolls are awesome and the Pho is always tasty. The only downside is that they dont serve beer. Came in for an oil change today saw Cody and he got me in n out within 40 mins!! 
Great service friendly people to chat with while I waited!!. Cowboy Monkey is a fairly nice bar in downtown Champaign. In the winter it kind of sucks because the indoor seating is fairly limited. During the summer, dare I say, it has the best outdoor seating in Champaign. Lots of seating and great atmosphere. The only other problem is that if you are going to go there for dinner your food options are pretty limited to some tacos or a sandwich. And thats only in the summer. The kitchen is closed in the winter months.

Some good bands tend to play here as well, and they have specialty nights a few times a week.

Misses the 5th star for lack of indoor seating and no real food selection for a place you would imagine would have a great full kitchen.. If you feel like some non-standard ice cream flavors, this is the place for you. I'm not adventurous enough to take full advantage of what they offer, but the tequila ice cream is pretty amazing. Recommended.. This was my last boss's favorite restaurant in Las Vegas, and he took me there to show me why: great wine selection and delicious food.  Don't be fooled by the french name of the restaurant -- you can get an amazing steak here as well.. Great shawarma and great staff!! However, the number of the staff is low so you will to wait for minutes, but worth it!. I was looking for the perfect sink and the guy on the phone (forgot his name) was really patient w/ me. I was on their website and was asking measurements on at least 20 vessel sinks. I finally found the one that was a perfect fit for my custom vanity I was building. Thanks!. I went into the store anticipating poor and arrogant service.  Reading some of the other posts prepared me for that type of experience.  What actually happened was quite the opposite.  The store ws very busy, but immediately as I entered Andrew approached me with a smile and eager to help.  I went in to buy speakers for my IPad.  Andrew showed me different speakers and offered his experience with my selection.  I purchased the Phillips speakers.  Even after I was being handed the receipt, I posed another question just to see his reaction...would he be impatient?  He was not!  His service was focused on me the entire time answering every question, even the seemingly simple ones.

Andrew made my experience very positive!  I will return to that store.. Very nice place. They have a full bar, the service was fast and friendly as was the food. I ordered the ravioli alfredo and it was delicious. I would recommend here to anyone.. MI sono trovato bene. Ho fatto aprire in anticipo i gestori, che stavano ancora pulendo. Capisco che è sabato, ma alle 8:30 è già tardi per la colazione ;)
Ottimo il croissant appena sfornato con la marmellata fresca di arance. Ho preso anche un bagel con uova e verdura. Ovviamente, ho preso il cappuccino con il caffè Illy!
Sarò stato condizionato dalla mediocre colazione della mattina precedente al mio hotel cinese, ma questa era veramente buona.
Ambiente carino e pulito. No servizio al tavolo. Non fanno crepes e pancakes, ma sono ben fornito di tutto il resto.. I went to AZ 88 this past week to meet up with some friends and an out of town friend.  It was close to our friends hotel so we thought lets check it out, I hadn't been in awhile.  

The Good: 
I've been here several times over the last 12 years of living in Phoenix and one thing I have to say is this restaurant is very consistent with their food.  It's always good, and when you order something you know what you are going to get.  A sandwich I had 4-6 years ago, tastes as good today as it did back then. 
 
The Bad: 
It's not really bad, but to best honest, I think its time for a little make over.  It's one thing to be consistent but this restaurant needs to catch up with its competition.  There are many many new restaurants in the valley, especially in the Scottsdale area and to the locals this can get boring.  This place hasn't changed in about 10 years, I think its time for a freshen up.  
Overall, its a great place that brings back many memories from coming here over the years, and I look forward to coming back again.. I enjoy this place.

"Whoz better than you!" 

The food is not five star but not 0 star either. You pay a reasonable price for good food. The portions are enough to leave you full and you enjoy the place as a whole. 

The owner of this location is friendly and fun. He has this thick accent and  is always willing to make suggestions.  He is a no bones kind of guy and will always tell it like it is.

If your looking for an alternative to fast food and like to whet your appetite on some Italian, it's a great place!. This is as good as it gets folks. One of the funnest and cleanest clubs you can ever go to. The bartenders are friendly, the bouncers are respectful and their set-up (both sound and lighting) is incredible. People you see are mostly classy - yea, you'll run into a few douchebags/skanks, but most people in general just seemed like wanting to have a good time in Vegas!

The dancefloor gets hella packed but what do you expect? The best part? Just walk away and you can enjoy the outside pool area which is freaking massive and awesome.

Unless you are on the Guestlist, or have a bottle service, I'd recommended buying tickets in advance. They have a separate entrance (not just line) to get inside so you don't have to deal with any BS line.

Also, they only play EDM/House, barely any top 40/hip-hop unless the some DJ is playing the opening or closing set. The headliner is always mostly an international superstar!

One last piece of advice - get there early!!. Ate here on 12/25/13. Got there a half hour before they opened. The mall they are in is pretty run down, but there is plenty of free parking. Don't let the outside of this place dissuade you from eating here. The restaurant inside is much bigger and better than the outside would suggest. We were going to leave, but a line quickly formed before they opened so we figured we should stay. This is the best Thai food I have eaten in the US. Service was excellent, food came out quickly, and best of all, the food was excellent. They also have a huge wine selection if you drink wine. Ate the Drunken Noodles with soft shell crab, Massaman curry, crab fried rice, Tom Yum soup. The curry was sweeter than I've had before but was quite good. Highly recommended. Honestly, not sure what the difference would be between a 4 and a 5 star rating. I can't imagine a Thai restaurant being better than this. Maybe I should give it 5 stars.. This is a nice new trendy place (by new I mean redone- it was The Fitzgeralds) right in downtown Las Vegas.  The rooms have had a light makeover with fresh new bedding, mattresses,  curtains, carpet.  I think the furniture might be old or at least it looked kind of 80s.   The bathrooms have not been redone but they are fine and the shower curtains are new.   We paid around $50/night so I thought it was a bargain considering the remodeling investment they've made and the fact that it's well located on Fremont St.   The a/c units don't work that great but when I mentioned it to the front desk they sent someone up quickly to fix it.   I would recomment this place.  Small pool area.  This isn't a place for kids.  Then again, Vegas isn't a place for kids in my opinion.. Located in the Mandalay Bay mall area, this place is a nice place that was very popular. I had the basic bacon cheese medium rare.  The meat was perfectly cooked.  A good char on the outside with nice a pink in the middle.  Not as juicy as I would have liked, so the Angus meat is lean.  The bun was a regular sesame bun. I was hoping for a brioche at that price.  It wasn't as good as a Bachi Burger.  My friend that the surf and turf.  The hardest part is putting the burger back on the plate.  It's too big and just falls apart.  Sometimes, bigger isn't better.  I don't think I would come back based on the price of the food.  It's good to try once.. I recently had lunch here. Fast, express in and out deal. Hailing from the Boston area good Italian is so hard to find.

I had the chicken parm. It came steaming hot with a thick layer of cheese, topping the red sauce. I was greeted with two huge slabs of tender chicken. 

Their red sauce was unremarkable. The good is it wasn't over sweetened and lacked the Mexican seasoning that plagues Italian cooking in NC. 

Their cannoli needs a lot of work. The shell is too thick and the filling bland and flavorless. They dress the filing up with nuts and chocolate chips, to still find it in want of authenticity. 

In all it's a great place to have a fast 1 hour or less lunch with a hint of Italian cooking. If you want a wine selection Press is in walking distance and run by the same management.. Two days ago, I walked upstairs and thought that I'd walked into an oven.  The AC was messed up.  So, I called these guys the next day and was able to book them for an appointment--they confirmed it with the tech and even called me up to let me know when they'd be over.

I showed the guy what was wrong, he went outside and messed with a few things, and then pulled out a capacitor that needed to be replaced, in addition to fixing a leak.  

I can sit back and relax in my fully air-conditioned house and enjoy the cool air as I write this review.  

Guys, you were definitely a lifesaver.  And, I'm so happy that you gave me a $30 off coupon for my next service (as opposed to the 10% Yelp discount I got last year).  I was surprised that they actually remembered me, but I'm glad that they did.  I'll definitely keep these guys in mind whenever I have another problem.. One of the best lanes in the valley for sure. Plenty of lanes and they offer a VIP area for the rich and famous, or something like that. A full bar with pool tables and dart boards and a game room for those who don't like to bowl there is something for everyone.. I love Mongolian grills, and YC's has to be among the best I've had.  Infinite combinations of deliciousness for an extremely reasonable price, and the employees are always friendly and helpful.  Drinks are included, and so is rice, wonton noodles, and soup.  I've never left hungry, that's for sure.

I only wish they'd open one on the west side of the valley so I could eat there more often.  

A great place.  Try it.. My gf and I went tues-thurs and we had reserved a GO room, which I had heard good things about. When we got there there to check in there was a long line, luckily there are kiosks that you can use to check in. However when I went to check in the room wasnt the GO room I had originally reserved. This is where the Flamingo gets the 4 stars instead of just 3 they upgraded us to a neopolitan suite. Loved the location and there are no resort fees, O'sheas is next door (good deals on drinks). Outstanding customer service.   I use to bounce back and forth between UPS and FedEx.  However,  this store stands out.  I live 5 minutes from a UPS store, but I make the drive to this store because they treat people right and are fast and efficient.. Really good clean food with great customer service - I absolutely will be back here when in the area. Great place. I've been coming here for about six months now on at least a semi-monthly basis. The prices at very reasonable. It's community oriented and the staff is all very friend. It's not so crazy as Lux, but that's some of the draw. The Refuge is very active about developing its niche in the community.. Love the decor.  The service and coffee was good.. Excellent!! Chopped salad is amazing!. Cute little place. Counter service of fast food Italian. When you want something quick and cheap, come here!. I thought we were going to have traditional tacos. There's nothing traditional about this place. I loved the Chipotle Cherry Steak taco, Guild Chicken taco, Yucatan Shrimp taco, and Street Corn. Great service. Great atmosphere. In an old church that was built in 1955. Come for the novelty, come back for the food.. The Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue appetizer was really good. Although I may be biased as I am not one to refuse warm bread dipped in melted cheese. Thanks to the past reviewers that recommended it. My entree was the Chicken Curry, which was also great. The service was excellent.. Who doesn't love a drive thru?

Well, I may be the oddball out here.  I actually walked into this place instead of opting for the drive thru.  Hey hey now, I hear the criticism coming from the back, but I was already out of my car at another store nearby and it felt unneeded to get back in my car to drive less than 25 feet.

It is sometimes better to do this, especially if it is the first time at the establishment, which was my case.  I wasn't sure what types of brew they had within, so I would have been that annoying person at the drive thru who could not decide what to get.  

They have all the basic domestics in stock, and some are in the cooler as well if you are too impatient to chill them at home.  They also have a section that has a pretty nice spread of imports.  Be sure to also look around a bit, if you can't find your beer of choice, just keep looking, that's what happened to me.  Also, the staff are always able to assist you in anything you need.  Prices aren't bad either, about as typical as any other distributor in the area.

They also do lottery here as well.. Kind of a cross between a thrift shop, an antique furniture shop, a furniture consignment shop, and a regular furniture dealer.  Their showroom is a huge selection of used furniture ranging from used particle board crap to serious antiques 100+ years old.  You never know what you are going to find.  For that alone, it's worth going here.  But wait, there's more!

You can order new furniture too--right up to the finest commercially available--at the lowest prices anywhere.  The quotes we were given had deep price cuts.  They are now holding our order until we can get our home remodel finished.

We liked the service, as well as the sense of adventure every time we visit.  It's HUGE.

Don't come in here looking for things to be nice and neat and orderly--stuff comes in and stuff goes out--they don't have time for that crap.  Never mind about pretty, but if you're looking for a deal or for maybe something unusual, GO HERE.

Want to order new furniture?  Don't go to prim and proper Ethan Allen with a carpet and air conditioning and an employee who will take your credit card with a manicured hand as she charges you full retail price.  At J&K, floors are concrete.  Maybe someone kicked in a cigarette butt from outside.  It's ungodly hot during the summer in there.  Sit down, sweat, look in the catalog, and get some of the lowest prices in the Valley.  It's worth it--it's worth it to drive halfway across the Valley to get here.  Down and dirty and cheap, with no pretense--that's J&K.. Hello friends, 
Long time no type!!

Short review. My wife was out grabbing groceries & decided 2 order out. She arrived home with a back seat full of groceries and....... A BIG brown pizza box. "Surprise"


Opened the box and found a REAL NY style pepperoni & sausage pizza (she said it was about 15 bucks. 

"I figured you would like this pizza. It's the kind u can fold like u like to RIGHT"?  Yes indeedy sweety. 

Nice big slices. Not shabby on the toppings. Will definitely go again... And again... And again.

TTFN. This has fast become my favorite Poker Room in Vegas.  Tournaments are well run and affordable.  The Staff is professional and helpful. They honored my special seating request (due to my wheelchair), without a hitch.

I like this place so much, I am giving them 5 stars even though I haven't won a dime there yet!  Maybe in May!. Troy came in to our home and introduced himself. We showed him the leak at our shower faucet. Then he went right back outside to the pressure gauge that another plumber told us needed to be replaced and tested it. then he worked with a pressure screw, released some of the pressure, retested it to see where the pressure was, then walked back to our master bathroom and showed me that our shower head was no longer leaking , adjusted the shower spray on and off, still no leaking, and the cartridge that we were also told needed to be replaced did not need to be replaced. Paid our $75 service call fee American Home Shield required.

 After he was finished at our house, I walked Troy across the street to a neighbor of ours to introduce him. I gave her one of Troy's business cards and told her if she had any problems to call Troy.

She told him she had been having some problems with her water pressure and he immediately went back to his truck and got his testing equipment to test her pressure for free. Found our her gauge did need to be replaced and showed her why. The cost of his repair was almost $300 less than I had been quoted for our pressure gauge.

This is THE PLUMBER you want to go to. He is now our family plumber and will be our neighbor's as well.. Walking by this place i glanced at the window and had to stop in. And all i can say is WOW.. It's amazing what can be done with sugar and pastry. This was a quick stop before dinner and I did not want to spoil what was in my mind going to be a Delicious dinner that ended up a wreck... Check out my Rainforest review for the details of that hurricane in the jungle... Anyways we bought 2 of the amazing looking cupcakes, The lemon Mirang and the Chocolate one that was decorated to look like a hostess cupcake.. Oh my goodness, we got home and split them 4 ways, words can not explain the chocolaty amazingness. This thing was rich and 1/4 of the cupcake was plenty, but let me tell you, I know jumping into the sea of people on the strip may not be your piece of pie but you should sure make this your piece of cupcake because it is worth the hassle.. Hell yeah. I've eaten at Shane's every Tuesday since I've been working in the area (since September 09). TENDER TUESDAY FTW. Tenders, a side, and a drink for $7.. just recently raised from $6.50. Seriously just awesome chicken tenders.. nearly on par with Rock N Roll fingers in Tempe. I used to get mine tossed in Teriyaki sauce but now I just get them plain. They also offer grilled tenders which I may switch to in the near future. The side of fries is obscene. I have trouble with self control when it comes to eating and would always attempt to finish all of the fries and tenders which nearly always resulted in hurt. I have switched to the green beans which are both delicious and healthy.. Nice little spot to grab a burger or spicy chicken sandwich.  Get there early for lunch though because the lines can get long.. I've been going to Victoria at NY Hair for over 4 years now, ever since I walked in one day--way back when I was new in town and needed a haircut. The service here is fantastic, the price is right, and she is very flexible with my sometimes changing schedule. Very nice atmosphere here also, as both Victoria and Nikki are super friendly. I highly recommend checking it out, whether you are a Las Vegas resident or just visiting.. I didn't waste any time going to Hash House A Go Go right when I got off the plane.  I was HUNGRY!!  And I wanted a big meal that wasn't a buffet.  Plus, it was one meal that I really wanted to get it over with since it basically kicked off what was my Food Tour through the Vegas Strip and was the biggest and most intimidating meal that I would encounter.

Since I've already had their Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles and Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, I went with a change of pace and tried their Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin Benedict.  And just like the other two dishes, once I saw my waitress bringing it to my table, I immediately started cracking up because it was so enormous (http://bit.ly/1KIcQLz).   It's a loaded plate - Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin w/ market Yellow Tomato, Spinach, BBQ Cream, topped w/ Scrambled Eggs all over two Biscuits and a Griddled Mashed Potatoes.  The Pork Tenderloin was good. If you've ever had Tonkatsu at a Japanese restaurant, it's pretty much the same deal, only 10x's bigger.  And I did pretty well, managed to kill the Pork Tenderloin and left one Biscuit behind.

Washed it all down with their house special Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade (http://bit.ly/1YwCGrU).  A friend of mine recommended it and even my waitress said it went well with everything on the menu.  They were right!  Very refreshing and colorful too!!

This experience was a lot better than my last visit 9 months ago.  Probably because this time I opted for a table and not a seat at the bar.  The service was definitely better as my waitress was very enthusiastic.  Also the $10 Restaurant.com coupon helped make it a good experience too!  So good service, big food, and full stomach.  It was a great way to start off my Food Tour on the Strip.. Excellent salad bar...and soups...and other goodies.. AWESUMM!! We kno pizza & wings, we're in town from Buffalo for Bills to paddle the Panthers. We drove 1/2 hr from Charlotte (Elizabeth), & it was worth it! Service and staff were very friendly. If U want cheap tasting Pizza- go elsewhere, they clearly use fresh good quality ingredients- @ reasonable prices. Truly a quality Pizzeria/Rest, & we'll be back!. The grill was good. Service was pretty good, food was pretty tasty, and the ambiance is nice. 

We all had something different. 
I had chicken crepes, very rich, lots of mushrooms, very tasty. Good job. 
My boyfriend ordered a Prime Rib, which they were out of, and he ended up ordering another steak, which was tasty.
My friend had a cobb salad. More items in the salad than lettuce, yummy, good job. 
Her boyfriend had a prime rib dip. Which is made out of prime rib, which we were told they were out of. I guess it is pre made? Not sure. But the sandwich was really bland, definitely not the best dish on the menu. 

Now, the mashed potatoes. I was NOT a fan. Who puts nutmeg or cloves in mashed potatoes and doesn't tell a person!?!? I see mashed potatoes and thing, YUM, butter, maybe milk, maybe cream, maybe even garlic. But nutmeg and cloves? Unless you like that, don't order the mashed potatoes. 

Now, the not so tasty mashed potatoes also came with a hair. Doesn't totally gross me out, but isn't pleasant. I asked for mashed potatoes to go, hoping I would like them later, but nope I did not. However, the manager comped some desserts and whatnot to make up for it. We did not ask for this, so I am assuming he did because we were really nice and easy going about the whole matter. 

So, although parts of the dishes I would not order again, because of the other food, the service, and the overall care of the manager (generosity as well), I would definitely go back. 

The desserts we had wereL:
A chocolate souffle thing, which was yummy, and a banana thing, which I personally was "meh" about, but my friend LOVED it. Thanks wcg!. John's is one of the best Chinese places I've been to in a while. The inside is beautiful, and the staff is very friendly. They bring crunchy "chips", I suppose you would call them, and a duck sauce to the table, similar to how bread would be laid out at an Italian place. Even though these are delicious, do not fill up on them, because the entrees and sushi are great here.. This is the new hot spot at the Encore. Really beautiful setting and incredible food. I have no issues with this restaurant. I went there on a Thursday and there was a local special which is $7 food and drink items!

I ate with a friend and we had amazing food and drinks for $35 at an upscale restaurant. I am also going again this Thursday! They had a dj and this is something that stuck out to me because most restaurants wouldn't dare try this.

The DJ played 80's, funk, and soul. I go out a decent amount and I kept saying oh I love this song I love that song! It is a really cool atmosphere when you can add some music without being intrusive. I think the dj added something great to this place. 

The decor is outstanding! There are eyes that change colors on a giant screen when you walk in. There are tear drop lights throughout the restaurant and my goodness the chairs were so comfortable I didn't want to get up. It could have been all the yellowtail or dim sum that I ate haha! I give this restaurant 5 stars.. Just  a quick update a year later.  Still a rock star with awesome office staff!. The Greek sampler is a good way to sample their gyros, spanakopita, moussaka, and dolmades.  This is a nice place to get some economical Greek food and the owners are very nice as well.. Good Mexican food, I come here often to have tried most things. Fast, and good food.. Great Place. If you like Chinese you'll love it. My family has been coming here for a couple of years. Consistently good and fresh food. Their pita is never dry and their meats are always flavorful. Good sides too! Wish they were open later than 8 pm though.. this place reminds me of home and im sure you will feel the same when you leave. 

this place has over 300 beers and the food is pretty good too. it wasnt expensive, the average burger and fries will run you about 14 dollars  . They have an amazing happy hour ( 3-6pm ) 1 dollar sliders and wings . During happy hour Miller, Bud and Coors products are 2 for 1 . You wont be sorry if you stop by . 

P.S. ask for Lori she is one of the best waitresses ive ever had . 

ENJOY.. You are probably thinking:  This pervert likes the fluorescent dancers so much that he doled out 5 stars.

Nothing could be further from the truth.  I am rating dinner.  RumJungle is a Brazilian inspired restaurant in Mandalay Bay.  They have exotic foods, but are known for their "Fire Pit" where foods are carved off a skewer at your table.

I had the salmon, which was cooked perfectly. Thats right perfection, not dryed up and overdown or clammy and undercooked.  My IT guy had the fire pit and was satisfied with the 12 different types of meats through his way.

Ernie the waiter was likewise excellent....Different and interesting food  with great service..... Still the best beer in Pittsburgh! Fresh, local and delicious.  Be sure to taste the low ABV short run beer session beers they offer- very original and easy drinking- the perfect compliment to a back yard BBQ or a weekend of yard work.

Looking forward to seeing Big Hop in cans!. Chocolate chip pancakes were amazing! No need for syrup.

Bacon pancakes are as expected, a wonderful achievement of the modern culinary movement.

For everyone complaining about the parking lot, grow a set. It's a hard right turn, get over it.

Service was excellent. Management watched over like a hawk, and greeted all patrons.. One of the best gay bar any where is town . The bartenders are all great . I have always had a wonderful experience . Being there and watching the bartenders if they don't know you , they will .I have read all the reviews on the Phx Bars. If it is busy there ,some people just stand there not saying a word for a drink . Open your dam mouth . Has for smoking  ,get over it ,it is a bar .never had a problem with it . The food is great !
Good people, Good drinks and the Friendly  bar in town.. Left hands down best tacos and quesadillas I've tasted in Phoenix. And cheap! Eat here especially after a drunken stupor. You'll love it. Promise.. HR calls you in unexpectedly. 
You think you're fired for sure. 
It had to be Jeremy in payroll you reckon...ratting you out for stealing your co-workers lunches out of the fridge, the little worm. 
You're surprised. 
In fact you're in shock when HR informs you of a raise and promotion.  
You rush home to break the news to your wife, unfortunately, she's in your bed with Julio, the pool guy. 
What do you do?
Still in shock from the raise, you grab your gun and shoot them both dead. 
You're proper fucked now. 
Turns out Julio was an undercover police officer with a pool business on the side.

You're sentenced to die for your crimes, where you spend the next twenty or so years on Arizona's Death Row.
It's the eleventh hour. 
Still no call from the Governor to stay your execution.

That's when the warden comes in to ask what you'll be having for your last meal.

Without hesitation, you order Harkin's Theater movie popcorn and a Coke zero. 
One problem.
You didn't buy the Harkins loyalty t-shirt and cup, so he asks you to fork over $12.50 when it could have been only a dollar.
Life's a bitch.
Harkin's Theaters make it tolerable.. This us one of the best Pizza places in the Phoenix Valley... Their sauce is not overly sweet and has a nice spicy overtone that makes the whole pie work as a culinary delight. Price wise, Casanova is a far better deal than the Coal Fired Pizza at San Tan Village.. Yes, it is expensive (as all high end restaurants are in Vegas). But if you are looking for one of the best steak dinners you will ever have, anywhere in the world, then definitely consider this place....also, Charlie Palmer, Smith & Wollensky, and SW Steak House, are all excellent choices. I purchased a vehicle here last month and am very pleased with this dealership. 

Colean, in sales, was very friendly and a good listener to my needs. She provided me with a vehicle that offers everything I wanted and within my budget, with absolutely NO haggling!

Elizabeth in the financing department was very professional and easy to work with.

The service department thoroughly inspected my purchase prior to releasing it to me. I appreciate this extra effort of safety precaution.

Word of mouth can be your best friend or worst enemy. I strongly urge anybody looking for a decent vehicle to visit this Findlay Lincoln dealership.. I haven't eaten at this particular Steak 'n Shake but I have at others when I used to live in the Dallas area. Fine cuisine? Don't expect it - just simple comfort food. The five-way chili (better known as Cincinnati style) is excellent, and the burgers - ahem - steakburgers do not disappoint.

Only drawback I've seen from reading other Yelp reviews is that there's only one location and it tends to get crowded on weekends.. Best Burger I have ever had ,you can expect to wait a bit but the line moves fast and don't expect a Whopper once you get there this is the Real Deal the Truffle Fries are Great too priced Fair and Good Sevice makes this Must Try Place. It takes big balls to have a bathroom through your kitchen!  Check it out!

Pros:

The place is super clean
kitchen well maintained! 
Prices are great! 
Food is not greasy and good tasting. 
Good parking, great convenient location. 
Very pleasant inside.

Cons:

listen if you are a bitchy negative person, like some folks who gave it a 1 star, you can always find something wrong with everything around you.  Bring a positive minded spirit back to the restaurant and you'll give it 5 stars. or maybe you just had a bad day.... Having moved here from Ohio, I was looking for a good massage therapist. After reading on Yelp about Jill I gave her a try. She did a wonderful 90 min. massage. Her knowledge about stretching muscles daily was very helpful; holding a stretch for 40 seconds was new to me. I now go for a massage every three weeks, always looking forward to an excellent experience. I highly recommend Jill to anyone for a great relaxing massage.. Really great service and the food is amazing. Right when you walk in they are very fast to take care of you to make sure your order is correct. The food is awesome as well. When you eat asian food at some places it can be very greasy, but not this place the food tastes very fresh.. Awesome local joint.. Exactly like all the other Apple Stores I've been to.  I went in to make a specific purchase, but got an excellent product demo on the new iPad from an employee - lots of new things I didn't know.  My purchase was quick and easy.. 5 stars! What is there not to love about Astor House, strong great coffee, best bartender in town, amazing food and wonderful host....and it is just around the block from me. I love this place, try anything and everything.. Great food!. I really enjoy watching the planes come in and out in this nice cafe spot. Food is decent and service is always prompt.. My wife and I love this place.  Delicious food and relaxing atmosphere.   Fantastic service always.. I was surprised to see that this location was not yet on Yelp, however this address is not listed on their website either so maybe it is a separate franchise(?). Anywho, I am giving a 4 out of 5 stars for this type of restaurant, not necessarily a 4 out of 5 for all mexican dining. I like that Juliobertos offers a "light" menu and wheat tortillas although I am not sure just how light these choices are. Also it seems to depend on who you order from but I have noticed that some of the staff do not know what is what when it comes to the menu. I have ordered the grilled chicken burrito off the light menu and received grilled breast one time, grilled thigh another time and shredded chicken one other time. Either way everything typically tastes great, I like that there is a salsa bar inside and the food overall is a great value as is with most 'bertos restaurants. Plus after a late night of drinking who can beat a $5 meal of carne asada fries?!!!. Great spot for lunch. Always fast and good food.. OK. You know you should have eaten before shopping when you enter a dog bakery and it smells so good you want to graze on the biscuits. Seriously. And had they served milk I probably would have sneaked one of the oatmeal apple treats. This bakery also has couture for all types of our canine comrades. My fave would have to be the hyper pink number that says Daddy's Little Bitch. Arf. Arf. Arf. Arf...that's our Schnauzer Emilie piping in with her version of four stars!. Ok, this place served the best bowl of ramen that I've ever eaten. I admit that I was skeptical at first when my friend told me about this place. I've had their signature Fukumimi ramen and their Tan Tan Men. 

I prefer the Fukumimi ramen. In my opinion a good tonkotsu should have flavorful broth but not to the point where you feeling like you're drinking liquefied lard. This bowl fits the bill. The noodles are the straight kind, the kind that I like.

If you like a good spicy bowl of noodles then definitely you should try the Tan Tan Men. The broth was a bit too thick and creamy for me, but it was still good. The broth was begging to have extra noodles added! It was spicy but not overly spicy where you can't taste anything.

I also had their karaage. It was very juicy and tender. One of the best I've had.

Their service was really quick and friendly.

This place definitely is the best ramen shop in the Vegas area. Monta used to be my go-to place, but now it is here!. Cafe Rio is one of my favorite Mexican fast food spots.  The portions are large and food is great.  I highly recommend the steak or chicken salads!

A few unusually nice things about Cafe Rio is that they give a free kid's cheese crisp with an adult purchase.  My only complaint is that all they have is a small cheese crisp for a kid's menu.  They also do not have any desserts on the menu.  

Their prices range from $5 - 8 per item.. This place is so so. I guess my expectations were too high.  It's not exactly chain style but it's not fine dining either. 

The FOOD:

The spinach artichoke dip was bomb! Very good. 
The Cesar salad is garbage. Worst I have ever had. 

I had the Lasagna.  It was extremely good! 

Wife had the pasta ala vodka. Also very good. 

But my favorite was what my sister had: the steak Bruchetta. My little niece had a burger. It was whatevs. But it's not a burger joint. 

SERVICE:
Our server was Brittney. She was very nice and courteous. Also very knowledgeable of the menu. 

One thing I didn't like was how they brought the Cesar salad BEFORE our appetizer. Salad always should come after. 

Plus it took a while to get oil and balsamic that we asked for and water refills.

Other than that it was amazing food and decent service. Will def come back!  

5 stars for food

3 stars for service. I've been here twice with co-workers. It's a hole-in-the-wall place downtown and I absolutely love it! The vibe is so cool, the service is great, and the food is amazing! 

I highly recommend the Windy City Dog. It's so full of flavor and one simply isn't enough! I can't say enough good things about this place, go check it out for yourself!. This is the diamond in the ruff, the locals secret spot for the best Donuts in Vegas. Try it once and you'll never go anywhere else.. Very good food. Staff is always friendly. Decor is quaint but dated.. I miss this place something terrible right now. I wish there was something even half as good as this where I live now. I never realized how spoiled I was till moving away. The low carb Pizza, the regular pizza, the caprese sandwich. It's all so delicious I am daydreaming of flying home just to eat it. 

I met the owner during one of my MANY visits and he was crazy nice but the girls who answer the phones are usually snotty. That is the only reason I did not give 5 stars.. Grilled pork sandwich was very good.  The grilled pork was very tasty.  The bread was great.  I am Vietnamese and very picky about Vietnamese food.  

It's much better than the crappy banh mi sandwiches stores used to serve in Houston 25+ years back.  Some people like 'old style banh mi' such as crappy questionable meat with heavy artificial flavoring, soggy with tons of mayonnaise and soy sauce.  Well none of that was here today.  Thanks goodness as I never liked the 'old style banh mi' even though my Vietnamese peers loved those nasty things back in the day.  

I like eating healthy.  Since they open at 7:30 AM in the mornings, I'm going to start going here for breakfast sandwiches.  Certainly beats most high fat breakfast options. :)

Update:

I came back and ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, che, and cha gio (vietnamese eggroll).  The grilled chicken sandwich was decent, good.  The che was too sweet which is typical of all their desserts here.  The eggrolls were okay.

Update 2:
The fried dumplings are awesome!!  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be available most days. :(. Jason's deli has a really great self-serve salad bar.  I won't rate the sandwiches, because even though I've been here over 10 times, I only have got the salad bar because I like it so much!

Tip: If you just want the salad bar, skip the lines at the front of the store and go to the self serve payment kiosk by the salad bar and pay there and get your salad plate pronto.   

Ok, on to the salad bar.  It is always fresh and clean even when they are packed.  There is a great variety of items, and they don't cheap out on the good stuff.  Olives, cheese, cottage cheese, oranges, apples, nuts, and of course all the other standard salad bar fare.

If you want to order soup you can get that for extra.  If you want more protein you can order a side of chicken or salmon too.  However, i haven't been impressed with the chicken or salmon quality for the extra price ($4-$6 extra I believe).  If you order salad bar, soup, drink, and a side of meat your meal is suddenly pretty expensive.

The little muffins you can get are awesome too!  For dessert there is a ice cream machine (ice milk really) to make ice cream cones or ice cream bowls.  Nothing fancy, but it works for a nice treat.

In the end, I always leave satisfied and full.. Very nice. The service was great and food excellent. Lots of food. We took home 1/2 of it.. I love Tazza D'oro! It is in such a great little area and is a nice place to spend some time with a delicious cup of coffee.

It it sometimes busy and hard to find a table (which is not surprising since it's a great spot), but I like the neighborhood feel and the staff has always been very friendly.

I usually get iced Americanos in the summer and regular coffee or lattes in the cooler weather. All of the drinks I have ever had here have been tasty. I have also had some of the pastries (and maybe a bagel at some point?) and everything has been fresh.

I'm a big lover of coffee shops and this place fits all of my requirements. While I don't live in Highland Park, it's definitely worth an occasional trip.. This place was definitely worth the extra effort of traveling off the strip for food, despite the nightmare that occurred while trying to get back (keep reading for the full story).

First, we had a group of 11, so the place reserved their side room for us which was pretty awesome. Next, the wait staff was super cool and patient with waiting for our mess of people to figure out what sushi/other foods they wanted. Then, the food came out and was absolutely delicious. After, the chefs even sent out some rolls they made special for us because they thought we would like them. Finally, the mochi/ice creams are included with the AYCE deal, so dessert was free (and fantastic).

The best dishes there? The Giant Clam piece was unbelievably delicious and really fun to tell people that you're eating (get it?!). Wet Dream was tantalizing. The Yama Special was perfectly prepared. The Seafood Salad had great pieces of fish in a fantastic sauce that I actually used instead of soy sauce for some of my tuna rolls. They offered Uni with the AYCE, and although I didn't like it I certainly appreciated that I was able to try it. The Edamame was low in salt for a change, which I can't praise enough. The best part is that no one had a piece of fish that was unpleasant, a feat not to be taken lightly at an AYCE sushi place. Also, the three people who decided not to get the sushi deal said that their dishes were also delicious and that they would go back again as well.

After the meal, the manager called us some cabs to get us back to the strip, which was really nice of her to do. The cabs didn't show after the 30 minute promised window, which if you know the politics involved with Vegas cabs really doesn't come as a surprise, so the manager called them again and complained. Then one cab finally came, which wasn't enough for all of us, so she called yet again to get us a ride back. Meanwhile, the restaurant is closing up shop behind us, but they asked us to wait inside their lobby area because it was cold outside and kept telling us we weren't in the way and asking if there was anything else we could do for them. This is what solidified their 5-star rating from me - I can't imagine anywhere else where the food is so good and the staff is so friendly and accommodating. Overall, this was the best eating experience on the trip and I say it was definitely worth the traveling hassle to eat there.. I met the owner? Jason I think.  He was outside having a smoke and I was leaving the BoyScout store with my son.  I approached him and asked if he had any IPA's and he told me about a few of his beers.  This guy was really nice and took the time to say goodbye to patrons that were exiting and to people arriving.  He seems like a really sincere guy.  I hope people visit this place because good people need all the help they can get when the take a risk and start up a new business. That is "Merica" baby.  Way to go.  I will visit this place this Friday and have a few cold ones.  Just thought I should share the fact that the owner is quite nice which is a rarity these days.. If you want a seriously meaty tasting (and salty) burger, give this place a try. It'll fill your meat/burger craving. Got the double smoke shack and it hit the spot. Fries with cheese ....oh so good! Nice crunch and they don't salt it. 

The just ok side...hot dogs. I really wonder how Hot dog can be amazing though.. My wife and I were craving a steak and decided on Saddle Ranch. Ribeye steaks were cooked to perfection mine medium hers medium rare. They were seared perfectly. The manager met us at the door as we were leaving and asked us "how was everything ?" My wife told her that we never got to try the jalapeño corn bread. The manager told us to wait and she went and brought us a big box full with honey and butter. Great way to end a great meal.... Just an update: What a difference five weeks makes...

The grass really grew in the past five weeks and the course has greened up pretty good. The course isn't running firm and fast like it was last time I was out there. It's definitely playing longer now since there is substantially less roll on the fairways. And the greens are slower and bumpier than last time. 

The tees were also unmowed. Maybe they just went light on the mowing today, but I hope they firm up the course again. Hopefully they can find a balance of keeping the grass green in summer and still keeping the course firm.

It was surprisingly slow out there too. I went out as a single and never had to join up with anyone. That's pretty rare for a day at Papago.. Awesome joint.  You wouldn't think the foods great from looking at the place but wow!  The staffs super friendly. Highly recommended.. Lamber Goodnow
If there were ever a law team that worked tirelessly to provide their clients top-notch customer service, expert legal guidance and counsel, and a commitment to learning and fully understanding a client's case, it would be the Lamber Goodnow team. Led by Marc Lamber and James Goodnow, the legal team is the epitome of professionalism. Marc and James are available to their clients any time of the day or night. They are approachable and responsive, and instill the highest levels of trust in their clients. The same goes for the rest of the legal team, who are warm and welcoming, yet very savvy in their field.. Okay, so the service isn't that great.  And okay the chicken wings are just so-so (I love the breaded 911 wings, so I like the wings, just seems many of my friends don't.  All that squacking aside, you still can't beat the location of Tempe Hooters, or the spirit and energy of the local peeps.  Are the girls the hottest of all Hooters girls no, but you still can't beat the whole thing all put together.  It's a good time.  When you are done, go up one floor to the rooftop and check that out.  Tell em Attorney Steve sent ya!. Wow!!! What a hidden Gem!!  This was my first time. The food was out of this world and the price was not even a drop in the bucket!! We had a large party at lunch and they were amazing!! The ambiance inside was not expected and just added to the quality. I will be going back soon! The staff were so gracious and extremely helpful!!. I recently had an interior paint job of bedrooms, bathrooms, trim, and touch up done through a competitor.  The price seemed to float higher and higher, even though I thought we had reached an agreement on the work to be done.  Needless to say, it left a bad taste in my mouth and some of the touch up looked terrible.  

I called David and he was incredibly helpful and sympathetic to my situation.  I bought a couple of gallons of paint and he made the most of the situation on a limited budget.  The house now looks fabulous and I will not hesitate to use him again! 

Thanks David!. Been going to Cane's since I lived in Vegas. This place always delivers a solid meal at a reasonable price. It is like the perfect marriage of flavors in each bite with the slaw, bread and fingers. The chicken is even better back at the house heated to a crunchy level and dusted with your choice of spices. Of course, you also always need to buy an extra Cane's sauce, so your not skimping on your dipping. Great sweet tea too!. Above and beyond on customer service and steel fabrication skills. I am very happy with my custom hitch and motorcycle carrier. I would highly recommend Lewis Hitches to anybody looking to have a hitch installed on their vehicle.. I was leery about using this agency based on Yelp reviews I had read. However, I know that they recently merged with E-Z Rent-A-Car, which I used several times in Las Vegas, so I was willing to give them a try. In fact, I made my reservation through the E-Z Rent-A-Car website.

The service I received at Advantage in Phoenix was nearly identical to the service I received at E-Z in Las Vegas. I was fortunate in that when I arrived at the rental car center, the building was nearly empty. No lines - ding!

The gentleman processing my rental was polite and friendly. I was given a choice of two cars for my Intermediate selection. I politely declined the typical add ons and options  that rental car agencies usually offer and was on my way in a very short time. My car was a Mazda5, which ran well and had no problems during my rental period. Returning the car was extremely fast and easy.

I can only speak from my own experience, which was that I got a great price on my rental, received friendly prompt service and had no problems whatsoever. I would certainly recommend Advantage at PHX based on my rental. Thanks!. You get what you pay for but love the fact that this extended stay hotel offers a full kitchen, minus oven. I enjoy not having to eat out every night when on an extended business trip.. Awesome pizza especially after a long night of partying. Good prices and been here multiple times. Good for taking out as well. Great great great atmosphere!. I had a great meal here with my grandmother, wife, and two young children.  The sangria was fantastic, and the moule frites delicious.  The service was very pleasant, but a bit slow.  The decor is tasteful enough to feel classy but not so much that I felt out of place bringing my children in for lunch.  It certainly isn't cheap, but neither would I call it outrageous.  For a respectable place to get a nice relaxed meal, I'd definitely recommend it.. I didn't really know what to expect from a Chinese/Mexican place, but I was happily surprised. One thing you should know, though: It's not a fusion place. There's Mexican dishes and Chinese dishes and a heartwarming anecdote about a Chinese girl getting kidnapped by the Spanish empire explaining the name of the restaurant. 

We had my baby nephew in tow . . . and he's a heartbreaker. So we got terrific service. A high chair, attentive service, helpful beyond the norm. Our server clearly knew the menu too and offered us lots of great suggestions. 

My one regret is not ordering more Mexican food. I was more intrigued by (and our server offered more suggestions of) the Chinese food. It was tasty . . . although we didn't love the dumplings: too much dough, filling was too sweet. The tacos that we ordered were awesome, though. We got the carnitas. Delicious, but way too small for the price. Wish we'd gotten more. 

All in all, I think it's a good bet. If you are a little adventurous, you can get a great meal for a not-too-bad price. Just bring a baby with you.. Best barber in the valley. Arturo is the man! Been going for about 3 years now and have never received a bad haircut. He does especially well on low fades if that's your thing... Sometimes a long wait, but just kick back and enjoy the soothing sounds of DJ Tiesto or whatever is jamming!. Stripsteak is in the Mandalay Bay/THEhotel complex, and offered an excellent steak and Martini experience. My wife was satisfied with the glass of Cab she selected off of the (iPad!) wine list, which was fairly robust. 

The Rib Eye was very tasty and served at a proper temperature, and the foi gras was delectable. The sides were just okay, and I wouldn't recommend the mac and cheese, which was watery. 

I would recommend the service which was attentive and knowledgable. Also, the duck fat fries however were awesome. Overall I would recommend Stripsteak and would go back again.. The Taj-Ma-Teeter. Need I say more? OK so it's isn't "cheap." You want that go spend time with the Walmartians......(I do admit to going to Wally World though for SOME things.....and HATE it!). But this store has everything, including a really great butcher (for a chain supermarket), great wine and beer selections, and those other hard to find items (i.e., Truffle Oil). So you will pay for the convenience and quality that is offered at this HT location. Thankfully it's only 8 minutes from my house. Yeay!. It was a good run in place. I would eat here again.  There ware several options and the staff is knowledge and fun.. No idea what the service complaints are about. I was seated during a very busy Sunday brunch/midday time. I never felt ignored although the service staff was working extremely hard to keep up. I worry that some of these reviewers want to be treated like they're the only people in the restaurant (or the only ones that matter). I went in with an open heart and mind and was not disappointed at all.

The cornbread that everyone raves about? Totally deserving. The best I've had at any restaurant, ever. The fried chicken was crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside -- again, tops. The green beans I had were not the best ever, but they were very good. The mac and cheese was extremely tasty, and I think I'd have a tough time getting my kids to leave the restaurant once they tried it!

My server was gracious and sassy, just as I like 'em. When I ordered a dessert ('nana puddin') after the meal, she told me it was really good and I'd better save her a little taste. But I couldn't do it. The food was so good, I wished I had two mouths and two stomachs. She pretended to be mad at me for eating all the pudding, but I think she was happier with the generous tip.

I will come back to this place any time I'm in Charlotte!. Friendliest bar in Vegas, if you're looking for attitude, go somewhere else, the staff is super awesome, and the atmosphere is like having a party at your besties house, "we're not here to judge, we reveal, and heal" Love it!. Who says the Midwest can't have tasty seafood?  Dim and intimate, Muramoto is easily one of my favorites places in Madison.  A varied menu with some fantastic Asian-inspired cuisine, this ain't your grandmother's Friday night fish fry.

Update:  swing by on Sunday night to try the blind chef's tasting.  4 courses ending in dessert for $30.  Never disappointing.. This place quickly became my favorite bar in Scottsdale. The staff are always amazing and are ready to recommend a drink. The bartenders treat their job like a profession not just a cool job. So they know their stuff and their drinks. John, the bar manager, is a great guy to talk to. In fact, I should go back when he is working and pick his brain some more about tending bar. Seriously, when my Dad and I were there. He just told us all about tending bar and all the cool things he learned. And as someone who is getting into the hotel industry, I might need this knowledge at some point. And go during Happy Hour, which starts at 3. Great drink specials. Cant speak on the food, only had it once. But the menu has changed a lot since then. 

Drink of Choice at Old Town Whiskey: Moscow Mule 
Because it is made in the traditional old copper cup. Which makes  it taste better, I swear it does. Also it made with my favorite Ginger Beer from Australia, which is always hard to find here in the US. Must remind myself to ask them where they get it.. Huge selection of Halloween costumes and props. The little spinning playground merry-go-round with little zombie babies was particularly creepy. The store is large and laid out well. Plenty of costume options for every size and style. I saw some of the items listed as new and hot for 2010 such as Avatar, Jersey Shore and of course all of the vampire craze. I was only there for a few accessories, but I found it quickly with the assistance of the friendly staff. Check out was quick, but I am sure that will get longer as Halloween draws closer. Stop in now and avoid the rush.. In all honesty the Rio isn't a 5 star resort by today's Vegas standard. But however for each time I've stayed here on my own accord or with TR members the staff has been terrific in making us feel like VIP minus 1 check out. It gets the 5 for continuing to stick to it's marketing approach and win or lose I don't feel like I'm getting jacked at the tables.... so kudos all around. My family has been coming to this garage for over twenty years which should tell you the level of trust we have in the owners and workers here. Just brought in my wife's 2006 sonata and had repairs recommended by a dealership done by them for half of what the dealership wanted. We now live in Surprise so it can be quite a haul to bring in a vehicle here but I wouldn't want to take my vehicles anywhere else. I trust them, enough said.. we had a planned birthday meetup at cafe boa for a friend. we arrived just early enough to have 1 drink on the happy hour menu. 

my wife wasn't pleased with her first choice, and i really didn't know what to order wine wise, however, one of the bartenders made a suggestion for a wine not on the happy hour menu but offered it at happy hour price! extra star for service!!!!

for the meal, i had one of the ravioli dishes...agnolotti boa. it was beyond delicious. it was some of the best ravioli i've ever eaten! hand made and you can definitely taste the difference. the sauce made for excellent dipping of a few bread slices!

the happy hour prices are reasonable, but this place is a little on the nicer side so regular menu prices are on the high side. still, the ambiance of the place is intimate and they have an excellent patio. great for brunch too!. Hotel is in the "thick of it".  We stayed in the one bedroom penthouse.  Beautiful room.  I think it is mostly used for events, but we wanted space and a balcony (overlooking harbor)...and this hit those needs.
Speaking with other guests, I sense that rooms in the front are noisy as the street scene is hopping till early morning hours.  You may want to ask for something facing the back street.
Other than penthouse.  Not much for views as it is surrounded by other buildings.  Great location for Old Montreal experience.

Staff was attentive, pleasant and helpful.. Great service and very trustworthy. They do great service on my vehicles and other than the routine maintenance they have not had an issue!. Pizza and Caesar salad were great, pretty neat place to get a quick eat. The best "neighborhood restaurant" in the neighborhood.  Great food....service...drink....everything.. This place is awesome!  I have eaten at lots of Chinese places and this place is great and reasonable.. Really nice staff. They are very helpful, and reviewed my bill. I was able to add additional channels and my bill went down by a couple bucks! Thanks for the awesome treatment guys!. Cheap & delicious. This shop's location make it like a live theatre reality show. Always something going on!. This place was excellent. The best steakhouse I have ever eaten in. We we got there we knew we were getting the Porterhouse for two, med-rare, so we skipped the apps. We told the waitress we were just drinking beer and she didn't blink. Lots of places expect you order wine, but sometimes you just want beer. My wife/fiancee was drinking a drink the bartender made up and wasn't on the menu...she ordered three. The waitress was very attentive and was the rest of the staff. They really worked as a team. Even the water boy was helpful to us. 
The bread was excellent and warmed perfectly. The butter was soft, with extra virgin olive oil and fresh cracked black pepper to top. 
We were sat on the porch and had a wonderful view of the water show with singing frog and dancing balls. 
When our meal arrived it was like a ballet with the setting of the plates down to the serving of the meat.
The Porterhouse: Came out perfectly at Med-Rare. I asked the waiter who the person on the line cooking it was. He said his name was Patrick.
Patrick, that was the best piece of meat I have ever had. Anyone who thinks a steakhouse is just throwing expensive beef into a broiler is wrong. It was seasoned perfectly, rested perfectly and cut perfectly. It is hard to get an even cook on something that large and you did it better than anywhere else I have a had one; coming from Texas that is a lot of places. I am also in the restaurant industry so I know a little about how to cook. And no, I'm not a waiter or bartender. 
The sides were to die for. Lobster mac and cheese! Yummy! Large clumps of lobster and lots of it. Potatoes au gratin. Yummy. Perfect bite to the potatoes, cheese au gratined till nice of bubbly to form a perfect crust and well seasoned; something lots of places forget to do well with this dish. Season every two to three layers with lost of salt! 
The sauces were all great. The black pepper veal demi was great. The SW steakhouse sauce was a nice bbq blend. Bernaise, while not my favorite was perfect. You could tell that they made a reduction with vinegar and tarragon and the made the hollandaise and blended it. The Tropical fruit and jalepeno was great. 
At the end of the meal I had pre-ordered a special red velvet cake. It cost 25. I figured it would be okay. It was amazing. First off, it was big. Unbelievable frosting! It was beautiful too! The whole meal was great and I can not recommend this place enough!. I am not a Las Vegas local (anymore), but this place makes me wish I were.  

We started with the garlic knots--Huge rolls, baked to perfection and bathed in garlic and olive oil.  Marinara sauce and olive oil dipping sauces on the side were exceptional, and the EVOO was among some of the best I've ever tasted.

The first thing that got my attention when the pepperoni pizza arrived was the glorious aroma.  Heaven!  The sauce boasted chunks of flavorful tomatoes...the pepperoni edges curled and crisp.  Topped with fresh basil to give it a pop and tie the flavors together nicely.

Service was friendly and efficient, and the ambience is surprisingly nice, given its location in a strip mall.

Dom DeMarco's is a jewel in the desert, and serves up some of the best pizza this side of New York.  I hope to be back soon!. After our stay-cation at the Rumor Hotel, my group of besties and I decided to go to brunch so we could nurse our hangover! LOL.  I've reviewed this place once before, however my opinion has slightly changed for the better.  On my last visit, I checked out the bar portion.  This time, I went and tried the bistro part of the Arts Factory.  

The bistro is uber cute!  The lights are dim for an intimate setting. There's exposed brick and air ducts to give the industrial feel.  The focal point of the décor is a golden sandwich star-type structure.  Each booth has a high back which makes for an intimate feel.  What I really like are the tables.  Thick wooden tables shaped like painters palates.  The only problem was that the table was so thick that it didn't give a lot of room to move into the booth.  Still, it was cute!  I don't know what our server's name was but he was delightful.  The only server there, so it took a while for service at times, but he had a lot of personality.  He was a thin Latino guy with an accent.  

For brunch, I decided to get the Carne Omelet for $13.  This omelet was filled with pancetta, Spanish chorizo, maple chicken, Cabrales cheese, roasted tomatoes and shallots.  This omelet was good!  The pancetta is a little tangy, big chunks of flavorful chorizo and savory chicken pieces.  The cheese was more on the tangy side and made the omelet super good.  The eggs were fluffy and this omelet super flavorful!  The only gripe about this dish was the size.  Compare to other great brunch joints, I definitely got more for my money.  I would have appreciated some kind of starch like hash browns or even toast.  

I'm glad I got to visit the other side of Bar + Bistro.  It certainly changed my original view and I will certainly be back.  Remember that it's more of a specialty bistro.  Prices are a little higher than what I think they should be, however, it's delicious!  Come check them out, especially for brunch!. They make gyros the way I like them. You won't find any lettuce on this sandwich.  Plenty of tzatziki sauce and plenty of gyro meat.  I keep thinking I should try other things on the menu, but I can't miss the opportunity of having one of his fantastic gyros.
Gentlemen behind the counter is always friendly, greets my wife and myself with a big smile and Hello.  It's always a great meal and pleasant visit.. They actually make some pretty good sandwiches for being a gas station. If I'm ever in the need for a quick fix and don't want to stop somewhere for gas, somewhere for food, and somewhere else I can usually make all three stops combine in to one and just get it all here. It's right think house too so I guess it makes for an even greater amount of convenience but hey I'll take one of these sandwiches over all the ones that specialize in sandwiches any day.. Solid, but not my favorite.  Maybe I'm more of a burger traditionalist.  I had two of their specialty burgers (St Patty's day and Southern).  SPD was solid with unique flavors.  Southern was bland to my taste.  I'd give them another try and go with one of their more traditional offerings.

Service was a little slow, but they were busy and I did not feel ignored, etc.  Owner was working the counter and did a good job representing his business.  

My favorite burger out there is from Modern Burger.  There is now one in the Sky Harbor.. This is one of my favorite places to drink beer in Charlotte.  I usually don't drive out to the Music Factory just to come here, but I am ALWAYS pre-gaming at this place before a show at the Fillmore or the amphitheater.  I get just as excited about coming here as I do about the actual concerts themselves....That's saying something!

I can always count on VBGB offering up a beer on tap that I've never tried before.  It's always such an adventure!  It's all craft beer here folks.  The food is very basic, but I like that.  I'm not looking for an expensive meal when I'm trying to get my drink on, just something to keep me going.  If you try anything at all, go with the pretzel & beer cheese.  It's terrific.  A great munchie to keep you grounded after all those high gravity brews!. This place is way better than Roberto's - There food is more authentic and they cook real meat compare to Roberto's which I never recommend to anyone!. Big portions low prices. I am not a shaved ice person. Have it a number of times but they are all like ice cones. Not this place...the best ever. Do not know how they make the ice so creamy but it is something you have to taste. My wife and friend had some kind of pineapple yogurt they loved and I had a pink lemonade shaved ice big enough for 3. Great place and going back again. Wish they would be down in Henderson but worth the drive.. My 2011 Toyota Camry was damaged when a chunk of tire was flung up into my front bumper and headlight while traveling on I-10. This was my first time ever having to have body work done on a vehicle and deal with the insurance claim that goes along with it. The insurance company put aftermarket parts on the estimate, but Matt was able to negotiate with his vendor to get OEM parts for the same price. This was a big deal for me. The work was done on-time and the work was superb. They matched the paint absolutely perfectly. Even under hard light, I can't find a difference in the tint and texture of the old and new paint. I won't even consider anyone else if God-forbid I need any other body work done while I reside in Phoenix.. Love their take home pizza.... cannot believe the quality / quantity of food.

I ask for double pepperoni - we GET double pepperoni...  LOVE the store... NOT the cheapest... I don't WANT the cheapest.  Definitely worth the difference.. This place rocks. Seriously. The food is so good I was questioning if it was vegan or not. The general tso "chicken" is delicious. The lunch portion was more than enough food and comes with soup. The service is speedy and the employees are super nice.  If you are a vegan and in Las Vegas, you HAVE to stop here.. It's not fancy but it is big with great tables and cheap drinks. Exactly what I look for. Also the service is really good.. That was awesome!  BLT and a Sam Adams on a beautiful day.  Sat outside looking over the golf course and it was absolutely wonderful!. This JJ's defines my lunch during the workweek; quick, cheap, to-go, online ordering. This location deserves the extra star for staying open on the weekends - something the rest of uptown needs to follow. 

The staff here doesn't change too often, so it is nice that they remember the regulars. Be prepared for a line out the door during the week lunch rush. Like other uptown lunch spots, they are prepared for the rush and know how to pump out sandwiches rapidly. 

I usually go with the #1 Pepe with bacon. Plenty of customization options available when ordering online. 
Bike delivery available for uptown. The delivery people know the city and buildings well, always impressed how quick they show up.. Pretty good, especially if you like dessert, seafood, and prime rib. A little expensive, but don't forget to tip.

I hear it's free if you are a frequent poker player at the Wynn.. Situated in a back corner of a strip mall with door angled in such a way as to easily mislead customers into believing this delightful palace is closed . Once inside the diner finds a pleasant ambiance suffused with soft pink and a cross between teal and evergreen. Also readily apparent is the friendly serving staff. Better than the setting is the great food. The seasonings are strong yet well layered. The ingredients are properly prepared with vegetable that have retained their crispness and flavor. There is no skimping on portions; be prepared to bring home the extras. Special mention should be made of two often overlooked parts of a great meal. This place serves really good tea and absolutely outstanding mustard.. Venue:   NASCAR Hall of Fame

Decor:   Nice, Clean, 

Service:   Friendly

Environment:   Entertaining, Informational

Food:   N/A

Prices:  Fair
 
Huge Pros:  Located centrally in the Heart of the City, relatively newer facility

Debbie Downers:  
 
Conclusion:   It is something everyone should check out as a tourist.  You don't need to be a fan of NASCAR to enjoy this experience.  Definitely give it a go to put it under your belt for the different exhibits and activities it has.

Overall: Whether you are a huge fan of NASCAR or just a casual fan, this is a tremendous venue with much to see.  It could have been located in a better Southern City 

Grade: B. This is in the space that used to be Diego's in the MGM grand. We were impressed by the service (knowledgeable and friendly), flavors (traditional Sonoran) and overall value. It's hard to find a family meal in a strip hotel these days that's good quality but doesn't set you back well over $100. Hecho is just opening and so they are working a few kinks out, but don't miss the table-side prepared guacamole and / or their ginormous nachos!. Have been  eating at Max's for 20 years.  One of the restaurants I misss the most now that I'm out of the 'Burgh.  Visit often and always stop by.  Great food and great Beer....not a bad combo.  I have dreams at night about there wurst platter and spatzele with cheese....definately a don't miss attraction. I recently went to see Jeremy at the Happy Valley store. What a great experience!! Jeremy took care of my issues right away, and throughly explained everything.  Every subsequent visit, he has always been very courteous and helpful to me.
Being that Jeremy is a manager at the store,  he has many more important things to do I am sure. 
Nevertheless,  even upon departing from the store,  he walks to the entrance with me, and opens the door! 
I cannot praise Jeremy's, professionalism enough.
He is a Professional. I highly recommend if you want the very best service anywhere, go to the Happy Valley store, and look him up.
Thank you.
Mike Larsen. Great service! I was impressed with the timely call back and scheduling an appointment in such short notice. I received a call prior to the appointment letting me know he was on his way. The work performed on my area rugs and carpet made them look new again. I have a hand me down fabric lounge chair my in laws gave us that was in new condition until the kids got ahold of it.  It was filthy and my in laws are coming in a week. NOW it looks clean and new again. I have used COIT before and others who are totally unreasonable with their pricing and their work was mediocre at best.  I will definitely be using him again. Great work, good and fair pricing.. This is a great little place right near campus. Seemed under the radar but I've been going for over a year and they don't disappoint. The katsu chicken is my favorite meal, sometimes with a side of hawaiian fried shrimp. The boba is what sells this place for me. Their flavors taste great and are never watered down whether blended or on ice. Black milk tea, thai tea, and taro are my favorites so far. Definitely coming here even after I graduate.. These guys do excellent work. I recently got side-swiped by some jackass on the street so I called my insurance company and they referred me to Campus Body Salon. It was close to my work and approved by my insurance company. I dealt with Todd Elliott and he was great to deal with -- very friendly and caring. I dropped my car off before a out-of-state trip and got back to find my car all done and ready for pick up. My car looked perfect like it had never been hit at all. If you need bodywork for your car definitely check out Campus Body Salon. They do an excellent job and are a pleasure to deal with!. Pita Jungle has really great hummus,  it is expensive but worth it. I recommend getting the triple hummus as an appetizer.. The banana chocolate chip pancakes are the ultimate evolution of the pancake. Not since mankind first invented batter has their been a more revolutionary flavor experienced by a breakfast-seeking individual. These compliments are coming from someone who actively avoids breakfast and doesn't take pancakes very seriously. This endorsement could not come from a harsher critic of breakfast.

In other news, the corned beef hash is very good. The service is friendly and the space is nice. Protip: Go when they open to avoid the line because they fill up fast.. Food is crazy good! The fried BBQ chicken is delicious and the French fries are awesome. Fast friendly service sodas are very fizzy and the restaurant is very clean. Try it out you will not be disappointed.. This is the second time that I have been in for an acupuncture treatment.  With a bad back and a skeptical frame of mind I decided to give it a try.  I figured acupuncture has been around for 8000 years and there must be something to it and going to a school at least there are several sets of eyes watching and checking.

Anyway, the first session (with Jeanette) went really well and for the first time in many years I did not have pain in my back and neck (AWESOME).  Ok, was this a fluke or was this all in my mind.  This was not a permanent fix and I knew that, my pain is back.  I decided to give it a try again since the first session went well (with Adebelle) and I feel incredible.  I just wish this place was closer to Chandler because my infrequent trips are not going to make a significant difference right away.

I also looked into the herbal medicine side for some other issues and this is very impressive.  I received my first herbal formula, so lets see if this works.. As good as it gets! The Capastrami is my ultimate favorite. Super tasty and pretty much the best sandwich here in Vegas.. friendly fun staff, decent food, reasonable price, very clean. stayed at stratospere for week with teen kids. was our go to for food.. Been here twice while on different vacations.  Staff is attentive, food is good and if you sit at the counter, its fun to watch everyone work behind the counter.

If you have kids with you, have your kids ask for a paper hat, they'll love it.. Some of the best sushi in phoenix! Mr. Lee, the sushi chef and owner, is a true artist with everything he creates. The atmosphere is really nice with really good music. The staff is very attentive and also have great recommendations if it's your first time. You can count on this place being consistently great every time you go there!. A calm, clean and pleasant environment. The only complaint would be, we made reservations online weeks in advance and still had to wait to be seated. The service was timely and efficient. The server was amicable and friendly. The food was delicious. The menu was slightly limited, but still a decent variety. I would recommend dining here the next time you're in the area.. Best Indian restaurant in vegas period. I have been going here for past 2 years. Excellent service with great food.. Excellent food and service. Most of the menu specializes in seafood and it's great. I highly recommend this restaurant!! I frequent this place every time I'm in Phoenix at least once. Last visit I made it back a second time in one week. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Don't let the location turn you off. Just go in and enjoy. Oh yeah - 22 oz. beers on tap.. Awesome prices, great selection. Got a lot of awesome inexpensive souvenirs. Very friendly staff, I wish a store like this was in Texas. Thank you for a great experience!. As good as it gets when it comes to pre-owned Luxury vehicles! Look no further.. I really love this place. Had the turkey cranberry sandwich and Clam chowder soup and was not disappointed. The sandwich bread is soft, and complimented well with sprouts and cranberry sauce...perfection!   The clam chowder was not too thick or watered down, was the right consistency with the right amount of ingredients. The restaurant is clean, spacious and well designed. The beverage counters are away from the check out counters and complete with shots of your favorite berry flavor to add an extra kick to your drinks. Last, they have a nice selection of desserts for your after meal delight. First time here, but will be my new favorite.  The salads are unbelievable!. It's been a year since I've last been here but my goal was to have a great night of karaoke fun & drinks.

The good news is that our favorite KJ Mack was stills here doing his karaoke magic and of course having hawaiian food is always an extra bonus.

The lounge was about half full when we arrived but as the night continued on it definitely turned into an epic party house with a great vibe.

From karaoke singing, dancing, and comedy from the lounge hosts, KJ Mack & Barman Chris, this is definitely a place to come have fun.

:). One of the best restaurants I've been to and probably the best of the many upscale restaurants we tried in Montreal. 

Duck confit - excellent.

Pickles - outstanding.

Mustard - great.

Steak tartare - good but not the best I've had.

Service - good.

I would come back here in a heartbeat if I make it back to Montreal.. Five stars for these reasons:

Genuinely friendly employees.
Motivated employees.
Good prices on coffee.
Good prices on beer.
Good prices on wine.
Good prices on glassware.
Good selection of household items like wicker baskets from the Near East.
Good selection of imported consumable goods like jellies, jams, and snacks from several major regions around the world.
The only place in "the world", apparently, that sells all-cotton white towels with a high thread count and a chevron molded pattern.

And genuinely friendly employees. Yes, that counts for a LOT!

The location is convenient.. We "Had a BLAST!!!" The staff was so friendly at the resort from the valet to the Spa and the Prado restaurant was GREAT! hats off to out server... we ordered  the rib-eyed steak (served on a cutting board due to the fact,  it was so BIG) with sauteed garlic and roasted tomatoes with mashed red potatoes and string beans and a bottle of red wine. This was a birthday getaway for me, a special surprise from my loving wife.  I felt as if I left the country. You must do the spa and spend some time at poolside bar order the Vitamin C , it has four juices such as orange. lemon, grapefruit and cranberry with Vodka. Man we had those rolling for hours we also stayed at the resort and had chocolate dipped strawberry's and a bottle of champagne in the room what tops it off  was the rosebuds all over the room and a heart on the bed made from rose petals.  Go have a blast and get treated like the royalty that you are, here in the great USA.

Give these folks a visit you won't be disappointed, :) Oh!, tell the Emoneyblue and J. Rammelle sent ya!

Cheers.... In the daunting world of big box corporations, it's nice to find a local business out to really take care of it's customers. Sick of phone trees, foreign customer service, and bureaucracy, I decided to Google local office supply. I called OPACS and the cs rep was extraordinarily pleasant and easy to work with. Lilly accommodated all my questions and needs and booked a local sales rep to come visit me the very next morning.....AND deliver some items I needed immediately! 

It's so great to get personalized service these days!. Crazy Pita at the District. They have a lot of tables inside and outside. Of course if its 100 degrees outside we recommend not sitting or eating on the iron chairs & tables. They have a few TV's in the place and for the most part they have it on ESPN (its a plus in my book).

I am not a Greek food connoisseur...but I loved CP's Kefta & steak skewer combo plate. Kefta is spiced ground beef...theirs had a little kick to it, very tasty. The steak was also good and tender...i've had a lot of steak cooked to a point of calling it beef jerky. They serve their plates with couscous with sauteed veggies, hummus with bread, and a Feta salad. All this for  $11.95...I thought it was worth it because of the flavors and I always have extra to bring home to munch on later. They also have freshly brewed Shangri La Iced Tea....which I think is one of the best tasting iced teas out there. My wife likes their chicken skewer plate. I had a bite and its very tasty and cooked just right. A friend had the steak pita and its her favorite and always gets it.

We have always had good service and the owner/ store mgr. always comes around and chats up everyone. Its not a fast food joint so don't think you'll get your order right away. The grilled food takes some time but its a reasonable wait. It gets crowded during lunch time, so make sure you have some time to spare.. Burger coma.  This place rocks.  They offer all sorts of burgers with different tastes and flavors.  Highly recomend their milkshakes.  BIllionaire burger is a must try.. Great restaurant. I am from Chicago and this truly represents a Chicago style pizza place well. Deep dish pizza tastes just like back home. Great Chicago themed inside with many great Chicago pictures and posters. Also, the music while your eating is great. If your in Las Vegas looking for the real deal Chicago deep dish pizza. Come here!. Just terrific.  Time and again.  Every dish bursts with flavor and the chicken tika comes out sizzling with a great seasoned crust to it, unlike other places where it's only unadorned skewered chunks of unseasoned chicken.  If they created a bit more ambience - maybe music? - and worked on the patio decor they would be a 5 star in my book.  I'm hooked.. Wahou !!!!
Super !!!!
Vraiment une magnifique découverte grâce à des amis.
Le cadre est sympa. Le service est impeccable et super pro au niveau des conseils, j'en parlerais plus loin !
Nous avons commencé avec une assiette végétarienne à 4 qui reprend différentes entrées que l'on goûte avec des pitas.Tout était succulent, très bien assaisonné et on a pu partager tout cela dans la bonne humeur.
Ensuite au niveau des plats 2 personnes voulaient prendre le même plat et le serveur nous a avertis que cela était copieux et ce fut une très bonne remarque de sa part car après avoir pris le plat à partager pour 2 il n'a pas été finis ;-)
Pour les 2 autres personnes chacune a pris un plat perso et ce fut trop car les portions sont gargantuesque et pourtant j'ai bon appétit.
Mon plat est un filet mignon relevé, la viande exquise et assaisonnée à merveille. Chose rare mais j'ai adoré le riz en accompagnement qui était cuit parfaitement et super bon. L'autre plat était super aussi.
Il y a du vin au verre et pas mal de référence en bouteille. Les prix sont dans la norme.
Nous n'avons pas testé les desserts car bien trop mangé avant ^^
Au niveau de l'addition le rapport qualité-quantité-prix est juste trop bien, on en a eu pour notre argent sans se ruiner.
Vraiment super content de cette découverte, il faudra maintenant tester Le petit alep :)
Je vous le recommande à 113%. I am drafting this review because I thought it was important to share with the Yelp community the quality of work that EZ TV Install does.  I have had Joe install  60 and a 65 inch plasma TVs.  He not only installs the TVs but he provided the mounts which are fully articulating.  He also supplied all of the cords for them HDMI and Toslink.  he not only did a good job at installing them in a timely fashion but he actually showed up on time and went about the installation in a very time efficient manner.  his pricing is also extremely competitive based on my comparisons of other installers on not only Craigslist but also around the web locally.  I went with him becaus of his friendly professional phone demeanor.  So if you're in the market and you don't want any tricks or games and you want someone to do the job and do it right with the best materials and installation, I would highly recommend EZ TV install.. Had a great time here. Went for my brother's bachelor party and got the "Competition Package". Not a single person left disappointed. Bus picked us up, and dropped us off. Front desk staff was full of attractive girls (something the company actually advertises) and the range staff were very knowledgeable and knew we were all there to have a great time. I definitely want to go back soon!. Stopped in to buck and honeys for lunch and was not disappointed. It was not to busy at the end of the lunch hour. I had the fire cracker shrimp and a bloody Mary. I could not believe how fast my order came out, nice staff and bartender. The fire cracker shrimp was very good and it had quite a snap to it! I will be back for the sassy cow cheese curds.. Update:
Having eaten here multiple times now, my experience is now a little more modest.

The Graze Burger is solid, but I realized it was a sloppy mess the 2nd time around.
The bibimbap is probably the best Korean dish in Madison, which isn't saying much. The pork and crispy rice make it pretty interesting.
The chicken & waffles are superb, as well!

The cheese curds are not my cup of tea. Something about the breading is just too thick. The cheese part of it is very good, though. 
But, if you want a really good appetizer, go for the pork buns.

The prices are affordable and portions are filling, especially for a premier Capitol restaurant. There is always a long wait (we were trying to get dinner on a Saturday evening) but it is well worth it.. Went there on a weeknight and the place was crowded. Heard others talk about it so we gave it a try. Surprisingly, with it being so packed, we didn't have to wait to be seated! The service was pretty awesome, food was good, and the beer was tasty. Great first experience. My only complaint is that it was really noisy, but what are you going to do when you have that many customers. With so many customers, the service still was great.. I drove past this place for almost 8 years. Which is very odd since it was within walking distance of my house. When I finally went in and had the corned beef I felt like a complete idiot. 

The food here is so good. They use boar head meat, vegetable taste fresh and the bread is on point. Never been disappoint by a sandwich from here.

Their soup is a little bland but I don't mind it that way.. I love this place. I have been coming here regularly for the past few years. Service is always good. The place is clean and the food is made from scratch, no microwaves. Love the look of the place and the beer is always cold and a great selection. 

I have been to Ireland and The Harp is very authentic ! 

To those that rated this place so low, I challenge you to give it another chance. 

Do not miss this place if you are in the area.. I'm not a popcorn person but this is really good.. I called to get a quote, the quote was so great that I drove down there immediately.  When I arrived they took my car right in.  The work took less than 2 hrs and it was great work. They are very friendly and professional.. My gf and I were in Vegas for a week and I had to check out the No. 1 buffet for myself. They really go above the bar in presentation, creativity and taste. I wasn't sure what I was expecting but I love casino buffets and what they served wasn't your typical ethnic and seafood items you get in buffets. High quality and home away from home food with a spin. We showed up a half hour before close and all items were at full service and the staff were not intentionally rushing us. The chairs were mini sofa chairs and the buffet is larger than it looks. Definitely try it out and review it for yourself. I know I'll go back the next time I'm there, unless another can trump them.. I have to say I love this place. I have not been out to Chef Marcs other place Parma but based on how great his pizza place is I know I have to try it. 

The food: the pizza here is pretty awesome. It's priced reasonably and only takes about 3 min to cook. The spicy sauce is my favorite with ricotta, meatballs and mushrooms. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. 

The service: the staff here is friendly and knowledgebase. They know their product. And are really good with helping you make decisions.  They are fast and efficient as well. 

Overall I love the pizza here. The cost is not bad at all. 8.99 for a plain cheese plus any toppings you need. My new favorite pizza place.. Pickled my liver here in the 80's, my roomate's older brother had mug club card #4. Lost my card when I loaned it to a friend, as I remember it was in the triple digits. Going back for at least one beer this weekend before the football game. I post if this perfect dive bar is even close to what it used to be.. We had dinner on a Saturday night. The restaurant was full at 7:30. Restaurant is not large and very simple but elegant atmosphere. We like that it is BYOB with a very reasonable corkage. We were started with a house bread and oil which was good and we shared the baked gouda appetizer which is an excellent appetizer for 2 to share. My wife had the Ahi Tuna special which she loved, cooked perfectly. I had the Duck breast which was very good except the top of the duck could have been cooked crispier, very favorable dish. We like to eat slow and our waitress, Ericka, was excellent in her pacing us and making sure everything was satisfactory. Would recommend this restaurant to anyone, especially wine drinkers, and we will return.. OK, the parentals came up from Southern Cal for a visit on the way up to Salt Lake. They wanted something quick to eat but not fast food (you know, the Taco Bell / Burger King crap). I recommended Abuelas since its down the street from the house. They said OK. 

(Now just a primer here -- My dad is a semi-quasi professional chef (has pro training but just uses it at the house) and a very finicky palate - junk food just doesn't cut it. My mom likes the finer things in life but will eat Taco Bell and such if forced)

So we arrive on Taco Tuesday around 3p, a few people inside. Pops was kind of thrown off by the walk up and order from the counter (as he is a menu and full catering type), but the lady by the counter was extremely friendly and had Dad communicating. Mom was in awe that the gal in the back was actually hand pressing home made tortillas. The order was 2 carne asada burrito plates (me & pops) and mom gets 2 carne asada tacos, chips/salsa & side of guac.

Mom's easy, plows into the tacos. Loves it. Loves the pico salsa that comes with the chips, liked the green hot sauce but didn't care for the red thicker hot sauce. Guac was good, real avocados but not much else, no problem. Roasted pepper devoured. 

Dad kinda picks at the plate at first and I think, ut oh. Then he says the beans and meat are very good and well seasoned. Hurray I didn't disappoint the pops. Ate everything but the grilled green onion (I stole that). Didn't care for the rice and chips much, but as he says, those are fillers and he thought the chip salsa was good but a tad too much salt. Overall - he was impressed and said he would return if/when they come back out. After 2 hours ago of Abuela's dining and chatting about stuff & life, it turned out to be a real pleasant afternoon. Thanks Abuela's.. New Year's Eve in Vegas! Wow they were busy but the service was great. The pizza was fantastic as well as burger and ravioli. They delivered within the hour which is long but considering New Year's Eve it was fast. Some pizza places were 1 1/2 hours. Will order again if in area.. Middle of the road course, greens in good condition (playing tough/fast), good pace of play, fairways good. I commend the staff on working to get players out during my 2 hour frost delay. They were genuinely working to accommodate everyone. Walking price was $34.. SHAUNZ! He's the man! Just finished my dreads! 100% Recommend this stylist! Mad skills, quick and talented! Hair pollution is the place to go!! 5 STARS!!. On the event of Julia Child's 100th birthday, Peg and I visited one of our favorite places. Duc and Noelle Liao 's expression of French cuisine has been a delight since they opened. His Le Cordon Bleu (Paris) training is apparent in everything he does. The lamb loin curry dish to the pepper cream rib eye entrees were better than they sound. French onion soup and gazpacho were equally yummy. Our server was attentive and, of course, Chef Duc came out on several occasions to make sure that all was wonderful. Desserts here are phenomenal as you would imagine.  Julia would be so proud!!!  Dr. B. Francais plus bas.

Hey why write a Costco review, we all know what's Costco! It's the good old Club Price! YEah That place is the joke The Simpsons mock once where Barney was drunk as hell and talking to a giant bottle of honey  in the shape of a woman that falls and then he think he killed her! Yeah that Costco! Supersize item of the most common thing you need in life. Everybody I know that goes to Costco has the same issue: they can't go there and spend less than a 100$! That's the ultimate choice of being a Costco member, accepting the fact you'll be over-excited by those 1 kg (2.2lbs) of Kettle chips!  Those 72 rolls of toilet paper and those  huge 4 kg jar of Hellmans' Mayo. Can we still call it a jar at 4 kg? Regardless the only thing I think his really worth sharing about Costco are the cool things that we don't know. 

1) Batteries. Damn batteries, I HATE buying 4 pack of AA Duracells, makes me feel like I'm going to need more and then i'll use the one in my remote control, thinking 4 was not enough after all!

2) Cell phone bundle! Yeah !! I'm not kidding, it even beat the corporate bundle I have at my job . alsmost 3 years ago I was looking for a Blackberry Bold 9000 and there was nothing under 199$ with a 3 yr contract. Costco had an additional 50$ off and cool and easy to pick bundle. So check out for their deal, they're quite impressive and they offer service for Fido, Rogers Telus, Bell, I'm not sure but i think Virgin too! 

3) Cheapest AAA Filet Mignon! 18.99$/KG (divde by 2.2 for price per pound)  for canadian AAA filet mignon beef. Now there's a lot of quality within the AAA meat and this is the lowest AAA but it's like, who's gonna bitch about eating the cheapest best categorie meat! Not ME!

4) Cheese! I'm a cheese fan. Now there's large variety of OK cheese and classic that is a must in your kitchen to have at all time. JArlberg for hamburgers or Sandwich, I like it! Parmesan Reggiano (Sorry for the spelling) and boccoccini (another spelling disaster). Gruyere. Point made.

5) SOMETIME the homemark (Kirkland) is awesome and the price is AMAZING. I bought a 13 pieces set Kirkland Inox kitchen battery. The same quality would normally be like 400-500$ and I paid 196$ + tax! 

Pourquoi écrire une critique sur Costco? On sait tous qu'est-ce que c'est Costco, Dans les année 90's c'était Club Price.  Très big, puissant acheteur et probablement le magasin qui a le plus de membre au monde. Les Simpson avaient même faites une blague ou on voyait Barney Gumble courtiser une bouteille Géante de Miel en forme de Femme qu'il accroche, fait tombé et coule alors une quantité astronomique de miel. Oui oui! Costco c'est ça, c'est un magasin ou tout ou presque est en Format dit économique. Tout le monde qui rentre au Costco ont souvent la même volonté; ne pas dépenser plus de 100$. Et chaque fois la volonté est crocheté par ce super-démon consommateur en soit qui veut pas arrêter de mettre des bidules dans le panier - gigantesque - d'épicerie. On devient tous sur-excité par nos pêchés mignon qu'on découvre en format impossible, des bonnes croustilles Kettle d'un kilo. Les 72 rouleaux DOUBLE de papier de toilette. Des contenants de 4 kg de mayo. Oui plusieurs resto se fournisse ici et il y a donc une logique a tout ça mais reste quand même qu'on y retrouve des produits exclusifs et de la variété incroyable. Voici ce que pas nécessairement tout le monde savent du Costco:

1) Des piles, des savons des bas, ces cocheneries que nous achetons souvent en petits paquet et qui coûtent si cher. P-e suis-je une personne unique mais j'HAIS ça acheter ces trucs. C'est tellement des trucs hors-budget qu'on ne prévoyait pas s'acheter qui sont inintéressants dans un panier d'épicerie.

2) Les contrats de cellulaire. Il y a un stand dans chaque Costco et ils ont vraiment de très bon forfait téléphonique. Exemple personnel: Il y a 2-3 ans j'ai acheté un Blackberry BOLD 9000 la-bas et c'était a l'époque 199$ + contrat de 36 mois. Au Costco c'était 149$ + contrat de 36mois. Belle économie dans un monde où au Canada, on sent toujours qu'on se fait arnaquer de façon monumental.

3) La Viande!!! Yeah! ils ont du Filet mignon AAA Canadien a 18.99$ le kg quand on achète le filet entier. Géniale comme économie ou dans les épiceries on paye pour deux A-AA a 25.99$. Est-ce que c'est le meilleur AAA nah! c'est le plus cheap des AAA. Entre-vous et moi, C'est le moins bon haute-de-gamme du filet mignon, big deal!

4)LE FROMAGE! Ils ont tellement un belle variété qu'on peut acheté et dans ses essentiels je penses au Jarlberg qui est extra dans les hamburger ou les sandwich. Le Regiano, les bocconcinis, du Gruyère, du cheddar en grain frais du jour!

5)DESFOIS, je dis bien desfois, la marque maison (Kirkland) est juste vraiment bonne! Exemple, je suis acheté un ensemble de 13 morceaux en acier inoxydable d'une batterie de cusine Kirkland. Même qualité d'une compagnie plus connue j'aurais payé 300-500 juste 196+taxe!. Found this restaurant on yelp.  Based on reviews decided to give it a try. The service was excellent the food was of high quality. The presentation was nice the flavors were outstanding.

We enjoyed the smothered fries the flauta' and the crispy rice and then sampled the fried wontons. everything was done extremely well. Prices are very reasonable and I would highly recommend this restaurant. 

The food is prepared fresh everything was done to perfection. You may have to wait since the food is fresh and prepared when ordered. 

Customer service is excellent. Food presentation is very appealing. I could see this restaurant growing if it had a bigger floor plan.. Went for lunch.  Great location overlooking the strip. Service was great and friendly. Food was delicious.....light and fresh. A bit pricey, but I would definitely return and recommend.. For white people food this place rocks. Big portions and good tasting stuff. The place looks sweet too which sets it.apart from Ihop. So give it a solid try and enjoy!. I had fun playing the penny and quarter slots here. I am not a big gambler but I did very well here which made me happy :)

The staff is also very friendly and helpful and the drink servers were timeless and nice

Shall return and win some dough. Very good ramen.  Had the tonkotsu combination which had chicken and some crab chunks in the broth.  Very quiet atmosphere, but nice.. We had a great experience and the communication between the doctor and nurses was very helpful to us.  The ultrasound was truly a sight to behold and although our little one decided to not be very cooperative, the nurses were patient and it was a pleasant experience for the Mrs.. Nice people. Bomb a$$ bibimbap. I'm sold.. When you walk into this place it's kind of intimidating with all the pasta and sauces and olives to purchase but after about five seconds you learn how wonderful it is to have a place like this.
 
  The people are always nice and helpful with all the choices. Now, I've only had lunch here but if the diner is as good as the lunch, I bet its spectacular! I always get the Sicilian Sandwich and it's on the mark, I can't understand how this simple sandwich is so good but I could never get my sandwiches to taste that good. The bread is fresh and the meat well is from the deli so its awesome.
   My only complaint would be not having a soda fountain in the deli/lunch area but they do have bottled soda and water
   I'm a huge cannoli fan so when I can get one to try I do, they have three sizes sm. med, large so went for the Med not knowing the size difference. I should have went for the large cause the med seemed small. They have a lot of deserts to try and I look forward to trying more. All the frozen pasta I've bought and cooked at home has been wonderful. So, If you want a good sandwich go for the Sicilian or chicken parmesan they are outstanding.. Worth the wait!

The lines can get a little long during peak hours but don't let that keep you from going. 
                                 
The staff at Pin Up Pizza were friendly and timely. It's a quick in and out once your inside.
                                           
The pizza is some of the best that I've had. I'll definitely be going back the next time I'm in Vegas.. Love the place.  My dad was a barber so I have an affinity to small non chain barber shops.  Have not not found one since moving to Arizona until now.  They do a great job for a reasonable price ($16) and have been more then pleased with the quality of the haircuts.  There is always good conversation, Eddie is a hoot,  and everyone in the shop seems to join in.  The decor is eclectic but makes you feel very comfortable.  It is a nice brake from all of the pretentious chains that seem to be taking over the business.. We only go there for cheap meal which it starts at midnight til about 6am i guess.. I could not remember the time.  But we get $3 hamburger and its really cheap and its good!  I would come back.  The only down fall bathroom is really really far.. I love this place! Great price for shirts and other things that only true Pittsburghers would understand.  The staff is always awesome and welcoming...as I said, it's somewhere I stop every time I'm in town, even if just to look at the new shirts and fun things they have.

If you are from Pittsburgh and you want to support local businesses, then go here!. Dim sum is good.  It's comparable to other places.  It's close to where I live so that's another plus.  Dinner is not the greatest.  Usually when you order Egg Foo Young, it has the meat choice on the outside as well.  A little more decorative in the plate, but this place, it's just the egg patty and everything inside and sauce over it.  It taste decent, but could had been better.  This place is better for Dim Sum only and not for dinner.. I agree with Jen T. that the decor could use some work. It does feel pretty generic. The food and service have always been great. Our servers have always seemed happy with their jobs. The strawberry pancakes along with the chocolate chip pancakes are the best that I have ever had. The orange juice is also outstanding as they squeeze their own. The Dutch Baby is also excellent. We always make sure to take visitors to the pancake house. When I travel back to the Midwest, people that have visited us will often talk about the pancake house.. A nice park. It has lots of playground equipment and things for kids to play on, as well as the mountains you see in the background. You can mountain bike here, (the trails are mostly beginner, but there is a 'secret' jump park nestled next to the reservoir) disc golf, hike, look at stuff in the distance, watch the planes land at Sky Harbor. 

The only drawback is that near sundown lots of homeless people usually hang in the park. Not really a big deal for me but y'know, little kids and stuff.. After a recent remodel, this edition of the Global Living Room has tons of new electrical outlets for us mobile officegoers. That and coffee!. Finally decided to try this place last night, went for happy hour at around 9 pm. The happy hour menu is really good, 2 dollar fish tacos, the 3 dollar garlic chicken is incredible, and all sushi rolls are half off. Plus good deals on drinks as well. The sushi was very good, well prepared, fresh and tasty. Like I said the garlic chicken was also reallly good too, and the mussels were great and only 5.50 for a decent sized portion, next time I go I think I will try more of the tapas than just getting sushi. 

Only complaint is that they need to get a couple TVs on the walls so you can come here to watch a game, etc. Definitely would help the atmosphere IMO. I've been to the Waffle Shop a few times, and each time is a new experience for me! Not only are the waffles delicious, but there's this vibrancy in there that really represents the Pittsburgh community.

Their talk show is an interesting idea - members of the audience can voluntary be part of a streaming talk show they do online (see waffleshop.org).

The Waffle Shop is a mandatory visit - whether you're a local or s a visitor looking to get a feel for the city.. I've stayed at a number of hostels in Edinburgh and if truth be told I would be happy to stay at all of the ones I've tried so far because they offer such great value for money and none of them have been so bad to justify significant criticism.

However, I do have my favourites for one reason or another and so I have to make a judgement relative to my overall experience with other hostels. I stayed one night at the Castle Rock after my preferred hostel was fully booked. The reception was friendly and well organised as they checked me in quickly and courteously.

My overall impression was of a very big hostel, an old building with a medieval theme inside, suits of armour and paintings depicting medieval scenes. The hostel was clean and tidy, the guests I met there were well behaved. The kitchen was large, the number of food storage boxes indicated the large number of people staying there.

The dorms were clean and I was lucky because there were only three other people in a 12 bed dorm so it was quiet. I was allocated a bed, you don't get to choose whereas in other hostels you can take your pick which is more flexible if you like to choose the lower or upper bunk. Lockers are provided, always a nice touch and gives peace of mind if you have cameras and computers. The only thing I didn't like were the sewn in cotton bed sheets because I like to stick my feet outside the covers because I don't like hot feet. Accordingly I didn't get a great kip in this hostel.

The showers were effective, modern and clean but it should be noted that this hostel doesn't provide shower gel and it should also be noted that breakfast is an extra £1.50, some hostels include breakfast in the price. 

In conclusion I would say it is a good hostel but not my choice due to sewn in bed sheets and car access is awkward here as well due to the location next to the castle. Nevertheless, due to the value it would be unfair to give this hostel less than 4 stars.. My Review is based on work done on high end HRE wheels with brushed and clear coat finish. Work was done by Ryan, who arrived on time, was professional, courteous and delivered workmanship that exceeded my expectations. Simply outstanding job. Wheels looked like new and there was no evidence of any history of curb rash, 
Would highly recommend them and would use them again. 

Thanks a job well done
Manny. I LOVE Spago in Los Angeles.  I didn't expect to hit it up in Las Vegas but we did so for lunch.

The lunch burgers and pizza are good.  The bread is good as well.  The prices are reasonable for lunch. 

Much better than the other places I hit up for lunch.

Recommended for lunch.. Came here for NYE and had a great time with my friends. Only complaint is that  took 1/2hr to get table ready after we arrived for our reservation time. Besides that food and service was great. Menu may be confusing, but waiter will be happy to explain anything, just ask.. Great Stromboli (Buffalo Stromboli) and nice beer selection.    I enjoy going there.. simple mall same oh shops. Definitely a different menu, but man the food is totally awesome.  Small bar, but has great bartenders and beer selection.. GREAT STORE!!  Went after Xmas..Great beer and some good specials..Huge wide aisles, nice cheese selection and other party food..I will be back!!  ( I marked it as Pricey, because GOOD beer ain't cheap!!). Been going to this place for years, great food and drinks, ask for the 702 HOT Sauce. This is the craziest hottest hot sauce you will ever I mean EVER!!!!. Hands down my favorite bar in Arizona. The food is good and the beer selection keeps me coming back as much as possible. If you haven't been here you owe it to yourself to visit.. I somehow missed this all of the times I have driven by it. 

The place is as clean as an operating room. They have a small bar, and seating elsewhere for maybe 30 or so people. The actual brewery is in a large open area behind the bar, so you can watch that going on while you drink. 

The clean smell of the place reminded me of the days when I lived near the Miller Brewery in Milwaukee. If the wind was blowing the right direction it carried the stench of dirty socks right up to my door. Why is it that these small breweries have no smell? Anyway, I was wondering about that as I sampled their brand new Oktoberfest and their Hefeweizen. Both excellent, and served at the right temperature. 

Others here have mentioned the lack of food. They did have signs up saying they were carrying some food now, but I did not investigate. 

Finally, the service was friendly, and the crowd was friendly. What more could you ask for?. Peruvian chicken is one of the tastiest ways to eat chicken ever.  It's marinated overnight in a blend of herbs and seasonings and then slow roasted to result in super tender and flavorful meat.

In Pittsburgh there are two places to get Peruvian chicken; AJ's Peruvian in Oakland and Chicken Latino in the Strip District.  Both places serve up super tasty chicken, but there are slight differences in their marinade which make them slightly different.  I always get a half chicken minimum; I gotta have my dark meat!

They also have more Americanized dishes as well as Mexican dishes, but when I go to Chicken Latino I order chicken.  On weekends they also serve up roast pork and ceviche, which is suppose to be really good as well (I have yet to try them).

I would recommend not only Chicken Latino but also all Peruvian chicken out there in the world.  Check it out.. My wife bought me a humidor for my birthday and I didn't have any sticks to fill it with.  I didn't really know what I liked about cigars so I went in, described what I liked about booze, women, and life on the edge.  One of the owners (who's name escapes me) was incredibly helpful.  He helped me pick out cigars that were in my price and flavor range.  From that I discovered the Tatuaje by Don Pepin Garcia.  This cigar remains my favorite to this day and I now keep my humidor stocked with Don Pepin cigars from cigarbid.com

This store is a great place to socialize with other cigar smokers, the selection of cigars, pipe tobacco, and accessories is huge.  They have a private club which looks awesome but even as a non-member it's a great place to hang out at (non-club side of course).  Check it out!. Very good Thai food. Frequent this place often. Panang curry is the best. Spicy sweet at the same time.. A really great place and we got a really great rate for an overnighter on a Friday. i love the concept of the suite rooms and the non-gaming property. very friendly folks checked us in at around 1130a and "waived" the $20 early check-in fee. considering the $25 or so resort fees that are non-negotiable, it's the least they could do. i'm still peeved about that, but, that's another story for my gripe with Vegas. grrrr...

anyway, very minimalist decor in the room. lends itself to being very industrial looking. clean lines and marble floors. nice big sectional couch as well as a pretty nice king sized bed. the jacuzzi tub was AMAZEBALLS! mama and i thoroughly enjoyed it. the built in rainfall shower head was very soothing as well. there's a small kitchenette for those with longer stays. a minifridge and a dishwasher as well. the balcony looked great, unfortunately, we had to go to the front desk to get the key or something. no worries, kinda chilly anyway. 

easy to traverse between PP and Palms on the "Skytube" walkway. really quiet this particular weekend right after CES so we pretty much had the run of the resort. 

overall, a great stay and we would love to be back.. Cute little Asian girl gave me the best massage.nice atmosphere. Good relaxing vibe. Employees had great positive friendly attitudes. Good price. I will come back alot. Only 35 bucks for foot massage. hotstone.. Quick update: Moved from Vegas over a year ago after 18 months of unfortunately getting to see Todd more than I preferred (own a high-mileage Audi A8 with an air suspension, a 2006 daily driver 911 and a sister-in-law with a 2007 VW Beetle that never changes her oil and you become very familiar with your mechanic!).  The level of personal, professional service and quality of repair work was always top-notch.  But just to give you an idea of what kind of guy Todd is: we recently blew an air shock that Todd had replaced over a year ago on our Audi.  Even though we're half-way across the country now,  I called him up asking for advice and he dug up the original work order, confirmed the part was covered under warranty, and offered to replace the part through his distributor.  Just a stand-up guy.  Thanks Todd!. Excalibur very pleasantly surprised me!

I hadn't stayed with them in over a decade, but a comped room and buffet thanks to my aggressive MyVegas slot and blackjack play (http://myvegas.com/) recently brought me back.  I don't know if all rooms are like the one I got (I think I was upgraded 1 level from the bottom), but mine was very obviously completely renovated, and super clean.

As an MGM Pearl card holder (2nd tier players card), I was able to skip the check in lines.  This is a pretty nice perk, as I believe it's usually Gold (3rd tier) and above that get that benefit at other MGM resorts.

The buffet surprised me as well..  I mean, the last two proceeding buffets I've had recently were Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon, and of course it's not like those.  But at a fraction of the price, and the fact that it has improved greatly from my last time having it, I'd definitely recommend.

Excalibur is currently slightly cheaper but in better shape than Luxor.  If you're going to Vegas on a budget but want some decent quality, definitely consider Excalibur!

PS - The resort fee is currently about 20 bucks.. Our favorite place for coffee- anywhere. My wife is a very picky coffee drinker and the plain old dark roast coffee is her favorite in the world- literally. I'm into more foofoo coffee drinks and they're great too. Great atmosphere. And independent of the big GMO promoting chains. A little gem.. Great stay here while in Phoniex for the weekend. This hotel is in the middle of it all. Its four blocks from both Chase Field and the U.S airways center. Also, a plus for people needing to fly here like me, its ten minutes from the airport. There is local transportation including buses and the light rail. Pool is kind of a bust since its just a lap pool, but a great bar with food and drinks and the servers are freindly. Never went to resturant, so no info on that.   It is also close to other local shops and resturants. As for the actual rooms, decent. They are really just standard rooms. Overall, a good hotel to stay at.. This place is the bomb! I love lemon and orange flavors the best!!. This place has a great moody atmosphere, friendly staff, and great food. I had Setu's Favorite which is a Pizza dish with pancetta, shaved garlic, baby clams, and roasted onions. It was delicious! I also had an order of Japanese Pretzel Sticks which come in a shot glass of chili oil. Great for $1.50. I also received a roll of smarties with the check. 

However, the staff was the best part about this place. They were all extremely helpful and genuinely care about your experience there. I can see myself eating here often. This isn't your average pizza joint, it's definitely an innovative step in the right direction.. Took Maddie here for a quick nail trim, was super impressed. Friendly staff, prompt service, and light on the wallet. What more could you want. My dog is with me always, so I wont need the boarding services, but will definitely make this my new pet vet! My co-workers have gone to the vaccination clinic they have where they were also impressed by the service and low price! Thumbs up for this place!. My wife and I LOVE Flower Child. There is nothing that I have had there that I don't like. It is great tasting, healthy food. Every single item on the menu tastes great except for the Pho. Their deserts are amazing too. This is a must try.. Great upgrade from that Buffalo Wild Wings (and the wings are better).  B32 will hopefully have a long run.  Clean, good food, good staff and great placement of flat screens.  The perfect non-dive sports bar!. Since Ace Hardware is just down the street from our home, I come here quite a bit. Unless I want to save some money, I'll take the time to visit Lowe's or Home Depot. But this place will have items that are hard to find elsewhere. Always have the items I needed, very friendly staff willing to help you at all times. Wonder whats going to happen to this place when they eventually build the Home Depot near by at the Prasada?. Simply the best coffee place in the whole USA especially this location (the first one opened) the owner " Luis " is always around making sure that the machines the grinders and the stuff are all working at 100% and the best possible coffee is served to the clients. If by any reason you don't like your drink just go back to the barista and he/she will fix it with no attitude and will make it again the way you like it.
I'm there many times during the day sometimes for meetings cause the atmosphere and the vibe is also very elegant relaxing and comfortable.
I only have 5 stars otherwise I could have put 6. My favorite hotel in Vegas. Growing up I was used to the cheaper hotels- I was always at circus circus or downtown, but that was fine. 
Caesars was my first "fancy" hotel and I've stayed at most of the nicer ones on the strip. That being said, overall I think this hotel is the best. 
They have a good range of guestrooms, awesome pools and, to me, The best shopping around (bellagio and wynn are too fancy and planet hollywood and the mall aren't fancy enough).

We've stayed in the Palace and Augustus tower and one of the older ones. The Augustus is the biggest, but the location of the Palace tower is the best because it's slightly closer to the shops and it's right by the pool.  (Since they're building a new tower, access to the pool from the Augustus tower was blocked - we had to walk ALL the way around.)  But even after that setback, I think it's the best bang for your buck since it's not too expensive and the pools are great. It's perfect for us because we like staying in nice rooms but don't gamble like high rollers...so going across the street to Bills or Flamingo is easy for the lower table minimums. 
btw: you have to try the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate at Serendipity 3. So good.. The food is fresh with excellent taste. The service is prompt. Only the setting is casual in a shopping center.. Absolutely wonderful place to stay. Extremely reasonable to stay here. Restaurant is excellent. Staff is awesome. They know us well. We only stay here now no matter what we are doing in phoenix.. This is now called Fry's Mercado.  It's as good if not better than the Ranch Markets.  Prices are so low they seem "almost free".   Everything looks really fresh because I'm guessing they move so much stuff so quick. They have the same specialty stores within a store as Ranch Market, you know a restaurant, bakery, juice/ice cream bar and tons of other "stations" for lack of a better word.    Muy bien.. Tasty steakhouse.  There's a coupon in the weekly junkmail bundle round here that makes this more affordable.. I am starting to love you guys more and more. I first fell in love in 2005. I did not have a football team growing up and it took me a while to find the right one. As I started to follow your games, I became more excited, more involved. I stuck with you through thick and thin. No jumping off the bandwagon.  I look forward to watching you guys play football every Sunday. I go out of my way going to restaurants, bars, etc, just to catch your games if it is not on local tv. I am a hardcore devoted fan that appreciates all the excitement and joy you bring me along with the frustrations and anger. I will be waving my Terrible Towel, loud and proud for you guys. Bring back the Superbowl this year and every year after that! I bleed Black and Gold. Go Steelers!. A nice and clean place. Friendly staffs. 
The Pho broth has lots of flavors.
Beef cuts are very thin and fresh.
Really good marinates on the chicken and beef.
These are my rating: 
1. Mi Quang
2. Pho special
3. Vermicelli combo (chicken+ beef+shrimp)
4. Chicken sandwich. Thinking cold toppings is going to tast great sounds odd....... But, this is great pizza. 
When you commit to doing something as odd as cold toppings you are going to strike out or hit a homer. Betos hit a Grandslam. 
Please stop in. It's a dive but it's outrageously good!!!. I didn't stay here during my trip to Vegas but I did go through it since I went to Marquee Day and Night Club.

This place looked amazing.  Each floor, room, section, hallway all had their individual stories to tell.  Beautifully themed and masterly planned out decorations.  Felt like a million dollars walking through this place.  You can definitely tell this place is a step above all the other hotels.  You can also tell the crowd is very different from the crowd you'll see in other hotels.  

That's what I love about Vegas.  You can find millionares and the homeless all within a mile radius of each other.. This is a really good place to go with the family. Picnic style seating with tvs.
The BBQ is really good it's just hard to judge how much to get because you by everything by weight. My wife gets the BBQ potato its huge and reasonably priced. 
My favorite is the pork loin and jalapeño sausage. 
Really good ice tea and all the free pickles you can eat..... Love this place! 

Love that they have locations around town. I try to goto one any time I eat breakfast out the house.. I can't say enough good things about Tan Las Vegas!  The people, the service, the product are all as good as it gets!  I have been going to Tan Las Vegas ever since moving back to the area a year ago.  My visits to Tan Las Vegas is a highly anticipated day of the week.  I use their high pressure beds on occasion but the real treat is the custom airbrush spray tan by nadene.  WOW!  she knows exactly what a perfect custom airbrush tan should look like...and by that i mean the tan looks 100% natural.  I am thankful for finding a true expert so close to home!  I will be a weekly Tan Las Vegas client for many years to come!. The BlackFinn restaurant is in a central location in downtown Charlotte. We visited on a business trip on a Tuesday night, and the place was hopping! The wait was 30 minutes, but fortunately we found a place in the bar with no wait at all.

Sitting down, we were quickly served drinks and enjoyed the bar, which is typical in these kinds of restaurants. Loud, tons of TVs playing sports, and lively.

Our appetizers came quickly and we enjoyed the buffalo wings and calamari. The wings were meaty and a little spicy, and the calamari was not chewy.

Dinner was split in the group between the Ahi Tuna, Fish Tacos, and Chopped Seafood Salad. All were well received by the group, and I enjoyed my salad as well. The salad had a coleslaw kind of appearance and taste, which doesn't sound all that appetizing perhaps, but it was tasty and had a nice portion of seafood.

Overall, the experience was very good and we had a very nice evening there. Pricing was average for this kind of place, in my opinion. If you want a nice, quiet evening, I would suggest some other place!. Some of, if not, THE best tacos I've had in Vegas since moving here in 2003. I live in Summerlin and have no problem driving to the other side of town to get my fix. 

The carne asada tacos are decent (as are the tripe and lengua tacos), but, the spicy pork adobada tacos are golden. At $2 each, they can't be beat. If you're planning on visiting, make sure to order at least one of the adobada tacos, you'll thank me later.

The service is extremely friendly as well.

Originally from San Francisco, I'm a seasoned vet when it comes to cheap, delicious, hole-in-the-wall taquerias. I almost don't want to admit it, but these tacos are better than any I can remember having in the Mission. 

I almost feel sorry for the taco shop across the way in the same strip mall, "Los Tacos." Almost. They're good, but overpriced. I believe Los Tacos originated in San Francisco, around 24th and Mission, and they're overpriced there as well. A single taco shouldn't cost $5+. 

Tacos El Gordo appears to have decimated the business at Los Tacos. It's funny driving between two competing taquerias where 90% of the cars are parked on one side of the lot. If they made burritos, I'd probably cry tears of joy.. So I have a friend who reads my reviews from Yelp when they are posted on Facebook. Almost after every review she instructs me to have Thai - I guess good Thai food is in short supply in Athens, GA. Looking at the Yelp listings, that is not the case here. 

Out of my available options near work, I chose Thai Elephant. I had good reviews, and let's face it, who doesn't love an elephant? The parking was easy to get into and the store was packed - a good sign of good food. I enjoyed the deco with paper lanterns.

The soup was the first course and it was a good thing I wasn't blind folded. I would have thought some scallions and a hint of pepper dropped in the lemon-Joy dishwater. Yuck. Thankfully the Thai tea removed all hint of soup. It was $2.25 for the tea and what a treat! I ordered the lunch special of drunken noodle with chicken - it is Thai wide noodles sauteed with jalapeno, yellow onion, carrots, broccoli, cabbage, bell pepper and basil. I could definitely taste the basil and although I responded "mild" to the question of mild vs. spicy - I am not sure what the spicy would have tasted like YIKES! Definitely bring a hankie for the mild. If you have sinus issues, have that! I have to say of the Thai places I have had, this ranks up there is the best. For $7.95 for the lunch portion, it was a great size and worth the price. 

I also liked the staff did not harass me during eating. They brought the soup, the tea and the food. Once they asked if it was good and I didn't see them again until time for the check. Now one lady asked if I wanted the check, a different lady brought the check (to which I gave my card), then the first lady returned with the bill (until I said someone already brought it) and a third lady came by to ask if I needed my check. I guess they are very diligent on the payment end. But the food was great, so I will be back!. Joel was on time and very friendly. He looked at the areas to be cleaned and then he started working. He was very respectful of my home and did a great job on the carpets!  I have four kids and two pets and my carpets were in serious trouble, Joel worked his magic and they look amazing! I will use his services again and I recommend him!. Great hotel!!! Just stayed here this past weekend and I was well pleased with everything there. Service was great, rooms was clean and comfortable. Very quite and non smoking casino. I would stay here again!. Great place! Everything taste like the real deal because its actually made with real ingredients!!! Nothing fresher made than this. Caprese Sandwich, Tomato Soup to get your dunk on, Earl Grey Tea.. Excellent! That one word goes for everything..... well everything except the soda. WHY DO 90% OF RESTAURANTS HAVE COKE PRODUCTS? But I digress.

The pizza was excellent. Even the olives that were only supposed to be on half the pizza were excellent. Not the black sliced outovacan olives, but small whole wonderfully briny olives..... me thinks calamata! The pepperoni was excellent. The sausage was excellent. I had my doubts at first. I do love chunks of sausage on my pizza and the sausage on this pizza was large flat ribbons............. BUT EXCELLENT! Excellent crust. The rosemary garlic knots were........ you guessed it...... EXCELLENT! The best knots hands down we have ever had. The antipasto salad........... wait for it.......... EXCELLENT!

Other than the soda, the only real issue I have with Old School is that it is soooo far away from my home. But no doubt, moving forward, when the night, or the day for that matter, calls for the best pizza in Vegas, it's over the river and through the woods to Old School Pizza we go.

One last thing, the owner needs to keep his son away from the Magic Mike video. Although we do enjoy dinner and show from time to time, that was one show we didn't expect. That said, the owner as well as his son have something to be proud of.. I have eaten here probably a hundred times over the years and have always had great service. Their gourmet grilled cheese sandwich is the best I've ever had!. Stopped in yesterday to grab a few pounds of carne asada since a friend recommended La Bonita. Only $4 a pound! Great flavor, good quality meat and good customer service. I would definitely return to this location.. Great communication, quality service, thorough cleaning, went back and worked on stains that I had pointed out and even gave me a bottle of cleaner before he left. I'm a big fan and I won't think twice to call again next time the carpets need a good cleaning. And oh yeah, he even did a couple throw rugs for me at no extra charge.

Can't go wrong...absolutely recommended.. Great service! Great food! Waiter was wonderful and very outgoing and also purchased us a item on menu for everyone to try! Prices are very reasonable! I would definitely suggest anyone in the area to try this place!. Had the ribs, a little wetter than I'd prefer but just enough kick to make them really good without being annoying hot (this place is Cajun). The Wynn is supposedly the ultimate Vegas hotel and casino. I got Bonnie and I two nights there for a birthday surprise, and I'm extremely happy I did. Unfortunately, being a high-end place, the table game limits were mostly set high, unless I felt like getting up at 3am to try my luck. I didn't. 

The hotel room had a gorgeous view of the golf course. (Grass that green in Vegas? How?) We were on the 27th floor and were checked in by a very helpful and friendly staff member. The lobby was packed, but we never once felt rushed to be checked in. Even their bag check, which held onto our luggage after we had checked out and still had some time before our flight, was super friendly and helpful. We never once felt like we *had* to tip, but were rewarded with many thanks when we did. It does lose a bit, though, due to the dearth of connectivity options. First of all, cell service in the room was practically non existant, for both Bonnie (T-Mobile) and I (Sprint). Internet access? $14 a DAY! Come on - luxury hotel. Include these kind of things, it really goes a long way towards not making your customers feel nickel and dimed. 

Their restaurants are decent - we only tried a handful, but if you're on a budget, you might want to eat somewhere else. Only one of them is rated less than $$$$ for price. More details on the eateries in separate reviews.. I can't praise Bob of Becker Electric enough!  He is extremely efficient, professional and he knows his business better than any other electrician I've ever met.  We had an electrical short at our home that was causing the circuit to continuously trip.  A prior electrician from another company came out and was unable to find the problem.  Bob Becker came out the following week and identified the problem shortly after his arrival!  He also recommended some other electrical issues within our 34 year old home that needed to be addressed.  He'll fix those on his next visit.  Summary: Don't waste your time and money with electricians who simply "work" for a large company with many employees.  They won't have Bob's knowledge and determination to do the job right.  Since he's the owner of this business and has a vested interest in it, he really cares about quality and customer satisfaction!

Roger. Best Korean food out there. Eat there once a week at least.  For Koreans who miss the hone style cooking. This does the trick!. A great alternative to the casinos on the way into or out of town. The pizza is great and so is the pasta.. We went on July-10-2015. We were very pleased with the quality of the food.The shell oysters,crab legs,shrimp and sushi are absolutely delicious.The wait staff were friendly and attentive. The price $ 25 bucks per person is fair compared to the amount of choices.Two things that stood out that I liked, was they keep your tea filled and they bring the check after you eat and not during the meal. So me and the better half recommend Tin Tin and suggest you go there hungry and you will be pleased. THE FOOD DUDE.    : ). awesome view from top. trail is a little steep and you can lose traction at times, so not for everyone. also, the trailhead is remote.. Wow what a beautiful restaurant.  Such a great addition to Summerlin.  And the outdoor fire is amazing as well.

I came here with my life partner My T.  We got the spaghetti and meatballs and the prime rib sandwich.  I seriously ate all of it in 10 minutes, the food is so good!  Prime rib was thinly sliced, and had horseradish accompanied with it.  The meatballs had 3 meats in them (grandma's recipe apparently)... fantastic.  I want to try their meatball appetizer that comes with the brioche.  

Great dinner/date spot.  I came here for lunch, but there wasn't really a lunch menu.  May be a bit heavy for some.. I was worried because I was in North Las Vegas and thought I would have trouble finding a decent place to eat.  Luckily for me I found Buffalo Wild Wings.  I am thankful that they have expanded out west so much recently.

Like everytime I got 8 boneless wings and buffalo chips with cheese and cajun spice.  Lately I have been getting the desert heat dry rub.  It is a promotional optionn and a nice change from the normal.

As usual the food was good and the atomosphere it nice.  The free wifi allowed me the chance to get a little work done while I was there.. Just like Dennys but with way better food! Open 24hrs so when we're drunk and cant drive anywhere late at night and finally make it back to our resort, we take a quick walk around the corner to this place for some good old fashioned American food. Everything we ordered was delicious and cooked right. Good customer service and clean restaurant. One of my favorites in Vegas for late night food. Their new Orange Roughie Fish sandwich is very good! Try it! They always give large serves so it will fill you up.. Amazing, great service by Emma!!! She was very kind & very professionals made the first impression what it should be. The food was ok, I really was not wowed!! To pay this much, & not be wowed is a bummer. Ok, great variety, but not great taste. I gave four stars because of excellent service & Emma!! Other than that, a lot of bells & whistles, but no wow factor. The endless memosa has gotten me ready to roll though. Good set up before the KA show. Let's see how that's gonna be. My girlfriend had a 5 day conference at the Mandalay Bay so she booked this hotel.  I got to tag along.  I only stayed Saturday night to Monday morning.  It's a nice little place.  I liked the fact that is was off the strip and quite and comfortable.  The rooms were clean and nice.  An actual internet cable rather that wifi was nice.  Flat screen TV was nice.  There's still places out there with consoles.  Oh hell, I'll be honest.  I'm still rocking a 1990 Sony Trinitron in my bedroom.

I have two complaints.  Our room was next to an exit, but that exit is one way only.  To get back in the room we had to come in through the lobby.  I also tried the breakfast buffet.  It cost $10, no big deal.  But the bacon sucked.  It was like that thin ass, limp microwaved bacon you get at Carl's Jr.  You're charging me more than a Denny's or IHOP, give me some real, meaty, thick ass bacon.  

My girlfriend only had one complaint.  The shuttle.  She was able to get the shuttle over to Mandalay Bay no problem, but after 8-10 hours at a conference all she wanted to do was get back to the room and relax.  The shuttle was late every day she took it.  She ended up taking a cab back one day and then bitched at the conference and got VIPed and a parking pass.. This is real middle eastern cuisine 

Tastes good

Great friendly service

I love this place ... Definitely coming again. I was to the library for a roundtable discussion so I can't review the books nor the study areas.  What I can say is that it is a beautiful building, unlike any library I've ever been in.  I noticed on the way in that the dedication plaque read 2001 so it's somewhat new.

I knew I was going to the Goldfield Room on the 3rd floor.  I saw the stairs on entering, and I made my way to the 3rd floor.  I studied the map and then saw a sign with an arrow showing visitors where the roundtable was being held.

The roundtable was sponsored by the UNLV Special Collections Division.  This division collects and preserves the history of Southern Nevada and especially Las Vegas.  The moderator of the event was Dr. David Schwartz, the Director of the Center For Gaming Research at UNLV.  The Center is part of the UNLV Special Collections Division.

The room was large, bright, and the sound system for the discussion was excellent.  What a super place for an event like this.  I hope to go back to the library some day when I have nothing planned and just walk around and browse.. I'm a little torn between 3 and 4 stars, but I'll give Fiamma the benefit of the doubt since the food I had tasted amazing.  Actually went here on a whim (mostly due to the fact that we were wanting to try Fran's Filling Station, and they are only open for Brunch on Sundays)... so we ended up next door.

The weather was great, so the outdoor eating patio was pretty lively... we ended up sitting inside... I'm sorry to say that we were the only ones inside.  This made me a little leery... and then the menus were presented...  totally not what I was wanting to spend on a Sunday night, but I made the most out of it.

Our server was pretty nice and he went through all the specials, which seemed like an ordeal.  It's nice that there was a lot of detail and thought put into the specials, but must have been hard to memorize for the servers!

I went with a special, stuffed veal shank in a red wine reduction accompanied by house-made gnocchi in a red sauce.  The veal was cooked perfectly and I almost wanted to order a toddler sized pool full of the sauce so I could swim in it and perhaps drown in it too.  The gnocchi was delicious and instantaneously seemed to vanish from my plate at the same time that my stomach was filling to capacity.

Because we were the only ones in the restaurant, it was pretty romantic and quiet... I'm sure this place can get cranking on the weekends.

Overall, I enjoyed it, but I think I will save Fiamma for special occasions.  The food is worth it (in my opinion) but I don't think my wallet can take a slamming like that for one meal regularly.. This is another mom and pop treasure trove, and the hidden gem is tamales!  The lunch special is hard to beat by any standard - good value, speedy service and delicious food at a low price.  Check this place out if you get a chance!. I really wonder if they named this after Kim Long or they meant to Pho Kim Long Time. Either way, out of many many Pho restaurants I've tried in Atlanta, New York, San Diego and San Francisco, this one is one of my favorites. Only Pho I've tried in Vegas but they know what they're doing. 

You'll be greeted by a huge Sea aquarium the type you see in MTV Cribs worth thousands of dollars. This place must be doing good business because the decorations inside are pretty hard core. They have another aquarium with a King fish and black and white Nemo's. Pretty awesome! 

The staff at this place is excellent at serving the customers. I think everyone that was working at Pho Kim Long (I can't stop laughing at this name) came up to our table (except the cooks). We had a busy table so you know how it is when people like to add picky stuff to their Pho... garlic, limes, extra mint, chili paste, nguoc mum, sriracha... etc. 

I ordered the Bun with Egg Rolls (cho gio) and char-grilled BBQ pork. The bowl was a bit smaller than usual but it was very well made. This is a simple dish but the key item is the noodles. Sometimes they are too soggy or they can also be too dry and sticky. This place had perfect noodles for the Bun. 

The servers gave us some Pho broth since it was so cold outside. Very nice gesture! Everyone had a small bowl of broth which was very good in flavor. However, if this is the Pho broth they use for every dish then I would avoid the Pho since it was a bit heavy in texture. I thought it should be more watered down. We had an additional order of fried egg rolls which was pretty decent, nothing fantastic but still good. 

Something unique about this place is their variety of Asian cuisine. They are obviously mainly Vietnamese but you can also find Chinese dishes and even Pad Thai. Very unusual in my experience. One of my friends ordered combo #108 which was amazing. It was similar to Bo Luc Lac but with bigger meat pieces and with excellent steamed broccoli. I'm getting #108 next time. 

Found my hangover spot a couple of miles off the strip! Pho Kim Long Soon!. 21st Street Coffee serves some very fresh coffee. It's more of a grab and go shop than a sit down place. The line here gets a little long on the weekends, but it moves pretty fast.. From the outside this place looks like (and may be) a reclaimed fast food joint.  But on the inside, it seem like you're in Mexico! The menu is not entirely unique, but everything seems fresh and home made.  The tortas are exquisite, and the cheese and potato soup and albondigas are my favorite in town.  Add to this a friendly staff (mostly family) and wonderful freshly made sangria and other mixed drinks, and you can't go wrong.  Beer is served with iced mugs,and chips and salsa, both homemade, are plentiful.. "Location, location, location" sums up this hotel pretty nicely. That's not to say that my stay at the Hotel Lord Berri was unpleasant though. It was quite the opposite.

The receptionists at the check-in desk are fluent in French and English, which relieved my friends and I of any concerns in regarding to language barriers. The person whom we spoke to was quite nice and the overall checking-in process went by smoothly.

In terms of amenities, the hotel was furnished well, at least for its price point. Although I am no connoisseur in regards to the quality of beddings and mattresses, there were no incidents of bedbugs or anything of the sort during our stay for the interest of future tourists; the room is quite sanitary and clean. 

The air-conditioning functioned well; when I first entered the room, it was fairly cold due to the strength of the air conditioning. It is easily adjustable though as I experimented on the later days of the trip, but it may be worth to mention how powerful the air conditioning system can be for those who dislike heat. 

TV is available for free and while the TV remote can be finnicky at times, all of its features are operational. 

The hotel does indeed offer free WiFi. In my experience, the network was stable and decently fast (I was able to stream video on it consistently throughout my stay) despite being tricky to connect to initially for those with mobile devices such as iPhones. Regardless, such devices were able to connect after a couple minutes of tinkering. However, it seems that the connection is strongest during the night and much weaker during the day from my experiences.

The bathrooms were quite clean and well managed. Although there were no handheld shower fixtures, all other amenities were present. The center of the floor in the bathtub is designed in such a way that it is not slippery, so the bathmat offered by the hotel was not needed. 

However, there were a couple of issues in the end. For one, the bathroom door lock was malfunctioning, where if the locking mechanism on the doorknob was pressed, the door would remain locked if it was not shut and would remain unlocked if the door was shut, making it essentially useless. Another issue was with the cleaning up of our room during the day. There was an issue later in the week with the supply of towels, where in the end, the maid did not clean my room that day. My room remained uncleaned for the following 2 days as well. While we did occasionally leave the hotel at later times in the morning, approaching 12pm, 3 days is a bit of a stretch and I expected the staff to have had cleaned it in the afternoon if the room was occupied in the morning.

As other reviewers have said though, Hotel Lord Berri is situated in possibly the best location in Montréal. It is in the intersection of two major (and one minor) metro lines: the Green, the Orange, and the Yellow lines, where the metro station (Berri-UQÀM) is literally 1 minute away from our hotel by walking. This made travelling simpler with fewer transfers and I highly recommend this location for those that are planning to use the metro to travel to their desired locations. Many tourist attractions such as La Ronde or the Notre Dame Cathedral are easily accessible by metro.

All in all, the Hotel Lord Berri is great value for your money and despite the finnicky service occasionally, its amazing location is able to offset this issue greatly. For those who expect the finest luxury, this hotel may not be ideal for you. But for those who desire decent amenities at a clean hotel that is close to the metro at a good price point, I would recommend Hotel Lord Berri to them.. A classic Pittsburgh staple.. Awesome coffee and teas, particularly the chai. If you come on weekends, you'll find some Liege waffles but be careful, they are so tasty they'll sell out before long!. Stopped in for dinner after seeing a show, and had the best beer-battered fish & chips I ever ate.  The only reason for not giving a 5-star review is the price was a bit too high for a fish & chips dinner, regardless how awesome they were.  (And, I was a little disappointed that they were out of Stone IPA.). Arrived again from another Scottsdale visit.   Place was super busy, but they found us a table quickly!  Like before the staff explained the procedures and set us loose.   I knew I liked their rib steak, so I waited for it first, before trying the other meats.   When I could eat no more, a server came by with Beef Ribs...I had to try.  They are now my second favorite and will have to ask for them earlier next time.. Best customer service, these days you don't find a company like Smart Security.  If you are looking for an alarm for your home, office, or business I wouldn't trust anyone else but Steve Richardson with Smart Security.. Took my '95 Cady ETS in for the A/C to be recharged.  Casey and the team did a thorough inspection and helped me get the car running great!  

Over the weekend we noticed a wire hanging and took it back and Casey reattached a bracket that had come loose - all fixed, no charge!

Great service!. Professional body piercing. That is an important phrase people. Body piercers who are first aid certified, cpr trained and could essentially work in a doctors office. Because these people are putting things under your skin, its important that they know what they are doing!

The staff at HTC knows what they are doing. It is one of the most comfortable shops to get piercings done I have ever been. They have awesome jewelry and an awesome ability to explain what goes into a piercing and how the body will react to the damage being done. 

They do not do tattoos, or use piercing guns, or sell t-shirts, bongs, or any of a hundred other things that I have seen in other grimy piercing places. This place rocks!. Finally a great restaurant with excellent service and you could bring your own wine.. This gem of a BYOB is a welcome find in Pittsburgh. From what I gather, the menu changes often and erratically so my review may not actually help you pick what to order. That being said, I've already started writing so here goes.

They did a squid ink dish with fish that really blew me out of the water. Also, the fish and chips is very, very good. The fall spice pork belly lettuce wraps didn't really impress me, but the other items more than made up for it.

Instead of dessert, I supplemented my meal by ordering a "raw bar" dish. It consisted of a few different creative takes on sushi (a fish salad, a few basic nigiris, and a "deconstructed" maki roll). This was pricey but extremely clever.

Avenue B seems oddly out of place, stationed in some random road in the 'burbs of Friendship. I applaud restaurant owners for striking out like this, bringing creative food to quiet areas that otherwise might be restricted to chain sandwich restaurants.. My very first time eating here and I am enjoying every minute.  Great customer service with OUTSTANDING food and good price.  If you are looking for a sandwich but want what you want on it... They will do it... They have earned a regular customer in me.  Goget a sandwich NOW!!!. Tammi Musemicu is great. She will stay late or come back to acomidate your schedule. She has a clean and neat shop. I highly recommend her salon to everyone.. Just used Max Piano Moving for the 2nd time this year.  We have a 6' grand and in April we sold our old house and moved out of town for the summer.  We sent the piano to my son's house while we were gone.  We have recently bought another house and called Jim to bring the piano from my son's place to our new home.  Both time's Jim and his moving partner did a great job.  They wrapped the piano and carefully moved it out of one house and into another.  They have a truck specially equipped for Piano and organ moving so they are very efficient and know exactly what they are doing.  You can always tell two piano movers that have worked together for some time because they don't have to say anything to each other to get the job done.  A nod or a grunt says it all.  

Jim is a real personable guy - courteous and easy to deal with.  He is punctual and utterly reliable.  These guys are my piano movers from here on out.. These folks are really nice and accomodating. This is one of many different locations and I must say I get the same amount of attention and hospitality at the various locations I have been in. Cancer is never a pleasant thing but these guys try to make you feel comfortable as much as possible.. I'm giving this place a solid four stars, because between the $5 yelp check in deal + happy hour prices, my burger and beer were less than $10 WITH a generous tip!  The beer was cold, as advertised, and the burger was tasty.  Not the best I've ever had by any means, but a solid cheeseburger worthy of being included in the namesake.  Our waitress was on top of it, despite having what appeared to be ten different groups she was waiting on, and the crowd was a nice mix of Scottsdale randoms.  

It's possible that I'm giving the 4th star due to the company I was surrounded by (Rick / Jon / Amy / Jolly / Heath / Laura / Jeff / Becky) - we shared some very interesting conversation as a little sendoff for our pal Rick who was visiting from N.C.  On this day, we learned that there are still people in their 30's rocking aol e-mail addresses... HA!  Definitely worth checking this place out, it's a solid option in old town Scottsdale, especially if you're trying to watch a game!. Matt's has well thought out food (although not a TON of options), quick service, and a nice ambiance.  Even though the service is quick, the wait to get a table might be long.  This is a popular tourist and local spot but worth a little wait.  The coffee is roasted locally in Cave Creek and the Cinnamon walnut toast is pretty awesome.. Great food, service and atmosphere!  Drinks/margaritas are super weak and too much mix/sugar.  Only thing I hate about the Spotted Donkey is that it's not closer to our house!. Excellent southern staples and great atmosphere and reasonable prices. Highly recommended. We came here with our kids and it was a good fit for the too. Loved the fried catfish.. Always great things from a PF Changs.. A great free experience especially if you are a fan. We saw Rick briefly and met Brettly out the front of the store. The short tour is a great insight into the working environment. Margaritas, music, average food, fun times, the Flamingo Hotel, I must be on vacation. This is my favorite tourist trap to eat at when we are in Vegas. I love to have Margaritas before noon, truly the breakfast of champions. 

I have to start with staff and the great service they provide, keep up the great job crew. They seem to be happy working here and it shows. My kids love the people on stilts making balloons for everyone young and old. Funny hats, animals, swords, and "special" balloons for bachelorette parties. Cover the kids eyes.

My wife and I think the food is okay. We usually order some cheese burgers or chicken fingers for the kids, my wife likes the coconut shrimp, and I will try some fish tacos. What we really enjoy are the nachos, they are the bomb!  Be warned, the nachos are a meal of their own. 

What gives this joint the 4 stars is the vacation atmosphere and the Margaritas. Must tries are the Perfect Margarita, the Pink Cadillac, the Pomegranate, and the Who's to Blame Margarita. I guarantee, after you try all of them you will be in paradise.. Cibo doesn't appear to need my review, since they have a lot of fans here and other places.  This is a good lunch spot if you can get there early enough to avoid a wait.  The patio is particularly nice when the weather permits.  I work about five blocks from here and I've only been there for lunch.  I've wanted to try dinner but something about coming all the way back downtown after I've driven home to Gilbert just doesn't appeal.  Maybe on a day off sometime.  The food is great.  I like the speck sandwich.  Speck, for the uninitiated, is just another kind of cured ham like prosciutto.  The bread is always perfectly toasted.  Currently they offer as sides a salad, fruit, or chips.  An orzo salad, a la Carly's, would be a nice addition.. Can't go wrong with Yard House imo. Please keep it up!

Pros:
  Good service
  Good draft beers
  Beer blends and beer cocmtails!
  Good steak
  Nice decor
  Nice ambiance
Cons:
  None. The very best tacos in town. The Aztec Tinga is fantastic...but the real star of the show is the Napoleon taco. 

Also fantastic are the quesadillas...and they will forever change the way you think about them. You'll never order a quesadilla from Taco Bell ever again. You've been warned. THESE quesas are puff pastries filled with gorgeous things, and then topped with Mexican sour cream. 

Also check out their salsa bar. Too many to choose from; and there are no wrong choices to make.

Run to La Condesa. Run past every other mediocre Mexican restaurant to get here because THIS place is the real deal.. Awesome prices, happy employees, and normally have adequate employees at registers to keep lines down. Saves us a lot of money on groceries and everything else. Will price match just about any competitors ad.. Good food l got the breakfast burrito called the California Big Daddy burrito.  I liked it a lot cool place. It's a hole in the wall type of place but really nice and clean.  Everyone was really nice. We will be back again. Also when we checked in we received 10% off our meal so if you try it its worth checking in.. If you're an Indian food fan and are looking to try something new then you should definitely check out Thanjai! South Indian food is a completely unique flavour profile then what you might try at your standard Indian resto in Montreal like Maison Du Cari or Le Taj which serve up North Indian fare. 

The menu is vast and most of it top notch. If you're a first timer my advice is stick to the south indian classics. 

Starter:  Idlis or Rasam vada. (the first a steamed rice batter dumplings, the latter are fried)
Main: Dosa! Be adventurous and prepare to get your hands a little dirty as you eat - it well taste best if you attack with your hands. Every dosa comes with sambhar - a lentil soup and chuntneys which are high quality and absolutely delicious.
End: must try the south Indian filter coffee. It's unique to the south - sweet and strong.  

Thanjai does a great job serving up south indian cuisine - with great service and a great ambience. It's a must try and you will want to return!. They still do amazing work, though they no longer have a seamstress/tailor on duty to do repairs or alterations. Yes, it's a bit more but it's still very worth it. Yet to have a single problem with anything I've brought them.

Tip: They'll fold the shirts rather than hang them. For someone who puts the shirts into a suitcase, this is such a time saver for me!. My wife took me to Mezzo on a Sunday evening. We arrived and there were only a few tables occupied ( it was after 8pm). We were seated and our waiter gave us our menus. And the we waited...probably a bit longer than we should have, for the amount of people in there. Our waiter didnt come and check on how we were doing very often. im not crazy about always having to flag them down for every thing. But the service was really the only drawback. The food was quite good. We had fried calamari and baked clams for appetizers. Both dishes were tasty, and big enough to share. For entrees my wife had the chicken piccata, which she absolutely loved the flavor. I had a Gnocchi special with bolognese sauce that was also delicious. Side note: the table bread was phenomenal! Turns out the bake it themselves, no surprise it was so good. Overall, we enjoyed Mezzo and will return. Hopefully the service that night wasn't a normal occurrence.. Great Pizza and Chicken Parm!. I've done business with this pawn shop five or six times.  I have always left happy.  So many pawn shops have rude staff, barely give you any money and are slow or have a bunch of weird policies.  This place is friendly, fast, and has always given me a fair amount of money when I want to pawn or sell my stuff.. Great place. Consistently pleasant staff. Online app makes check-in process easy with minimal wait. Some haircut shops like this are a mess, especially the wait times and short staffing. I will keep coming back. Keep up the great service.. This has to be my favorite casino in Las Vegas.  I been coming to El Cortez since 2006 and it still hasnt disaapoint me yet.  They have the best gambling in town with great slots and my personal favorite 25 cent roulette where you cant find anywhere in Vegas.  I even had stayed here many times and the rooms are very affordable and comfortable.  I will recommend this place to anyone who wants to enjoy great gambling. fantastic stay, great restuarant, and cocktail.  Have fun Las Vegas I approve this message. Thia place ia great... absolutely the best chicken at a chain restaurant you can get! Go here weekly and quality is always top notch!. This review is based on my experience BEFORE move in. I'll add another one after I've gotten settled at Cielo.

My experience with the leasing office has been fantastic. Anita and Tabitha have both been very welcoming and professional... even when I've probably been slightly frustrating to work with. They've let me tour the building multiple times, they've responded to all the emails I've sent them in a timely manner, they've changed our move in date for us without complaint, and they've remembered my name and always greeted me with a smile. 

4.5 isn't an available rating, so I've decided to give Cielo a 5. The only negative thing I can say about Cielo so far is that it's a little pricey.. I'd like to start by saying that the VIP Area was a damn joke. Long lines for OK food which ran out and was not replenished. 

Otherwise, it was a great event. The vendors were amazing, the entertainment was fantastic and the whole day was just splendid.

Also, the Yelp! both with the pretzel necklaces was nifty.

CAN'T WAIT for next year!!. OK I do not drink hard liquor, but this very cool place was on my latest tour with Las Vegas Beer tours, and I must say I enjoyed it very much. The owner is an awesome guy, and he gave us the grand tour. Several of the employees also greeted us, and talked to us about the product. 

They handle their own distribution, company right in house, and a liquor store which they own right next door. Wala their own 3 tier system, GENIUS!!!

Very cool place, well worth a trip out!!!. I almost threw up from the amount of food they gave me and I stupidly tried to eat all of. I ordered a milk shake and it was well over a litre. It was incredibly delicious but putting down that and a huge burger was a bit of a chore for my stomach.

But I feel like you have to check this place out. It feels like such a Vegas kind of place and the food is very tasty.. This place is awesome! The staff is there to help even though they are getting there butts kicked hands down my go to for bargains. This is a pretty neat smokeshop with more than just tobacco and the related. Aside from the plethora of bowls, "water pipes", hookahs and such they also sell the various flavored, specially scented and even nicotine-free tobaccos. I'm no smoker (of licit or illicit paraphernalia) but I can see what regulars would see in this place.

They also have lots of counter-culture stickers and patches, statuettes, home decor and tons of incense. Quite a few t-shirts from the expected Bob Marley on into the more modern band scene. Want more? Plenty of jewelry including a piece for every type of piercing you could have. And if you're one of those disc-golf jocks then you may be surprised to find your fix here. I do believe they even sell a pop-up net...or trap...or hole....or whatever they call the goal in disc golf. I'm not in that fandom, sorry.

Of course if you just want a standard pack-o'-smokes they've got those too.. Fantastic value for locals. VERY TOUGH course. Greens always in immaculate condition. Desperado is crazy hard, I like Diablo and Outlaw. So happy to call this my home course. Great GPS with tips for the hole you are on.. Very good. Service was fast, portion sizes were good, they're small salad was excellent. Tired Farley's for the first time last night.  Very good thin crust pizza and chef salad.  I think this is our new pizza place and they deliver!!. Stumbled upon this place by accident while on vacation to the area.  Pleasantly suprised by this place.  First of all the BBQ smell inside is incredible!!  Basically this place takes a burger and puts an AZ spin on it.  I ordered a bacon wrapped hotdog with green chilis....it was excellent.  But don't come here if you're in a hurry.  Not that their slow, but everything is made to order, so it's not fast food.. Great Place! The food was like a fine restaurant in Taos! I had the Taos Combo Honey Smoked Pork Tamale, Tenderloin Relleno & Shrimp Enchilada for 16.95. Awesome! Rustic and tasty! They server was very good! We went to the Roaring Fork the night before and the food was not that good and cost 2 times more than B/A and I was treated to an undercooked piece of chicken! :oP Go if you have the chance! Don't forget the Sopapillas! We had 10 people and the service was great.
 As for the one star ratings. You can't drop a single star rating an then say the food is great. To me 90% of a rating is the food. Scottsdale location was Awesome as well! went there 2 nights in a row. Places have off nights it happens. If you say the food was great but you will never go again seems like your a bit high maintenance. Get over it!. I've become a regular here, and I actually begin to miss this place if I go more than a couple of weeks without a visit.  It isn't so much that the ambiance readily engages or celebrates Mexican spirit and charm (it doesn't), or that seating is otherwise comfortable and spacious (it can be tight and some inside tables sit high).  But the food is amazing, the margaritas are my favorites anywhere, and the service has been excellent (with one rare exception when it seemed to take exorbitantly long for our waitress to initially appear).  

I'm one of those rare individuals in the southwest who doesn't generally care for guacamole ... pureed avocado (to baby food consistency) with chopped tomatoes is generally not my thing.  But I genuinely can't get enough of the guacamole at Sombreros.  Its chunky avocado, cilantro, tomatoes, lime, and cheese are perfectly put together and served with chips that can carry the load while still managing to be light.  My wife and I typically throw caution to the wind (given that we intend to order dinner entrees, as well), and order the large portion.  There's never any left and we duel for the last bits with warring chips (I hate to admit I lose most of the time).  Although the guacamole is by far our favorite, other appetizers are excellent as well.  The queso fundido (with multiple choices for fillings) is very good, and my wife swears by the huitlacoche crepas, which she often has as a main course to follow the guacamole.

We've never had any entrée that didn't live up to expectation, and the Puerco en Chipotle is a favorite that is hard to ignore every time we come.  The pork is incredibly tender and juicy, the chipotle sauce (more like a juice) is spicy without being overwhelming.  With a couple of warm tortillas if you want them, its hard to leave a bite behind.  The Lamb Adobo is excellent as well, and the Pollo con Espinacas (with a chipotle cream sauce) is a spicy taste treat.  The Puerco en Mole Verde received high marks as well.  The entrees come with two traditional sides, and beans, rice, etc. are all fine but nothing exceptional.

Always hoping to find a great margarita when we're out, I've tried many.  There are some good ones to be found to be sure, but I'm impressed by the quality and pour at Sombreros.  My personal favorite is the Cadillac, but there are many excellent ones from which to choose and an outstanding selection of tequilas if you're partial to shots and chasers.  

It's been a couple of weeks since I've been there ... I'm feeling the pull.. A Madison favorite of my wife and I. Great pizza, tasty pasta. good wine list.. I was invited to dine at CT&T by a local - someone who has lived in the area their whole life and who savors good beer and cheese curds.  When he said that it was 1) the best cheese curds he'd ever tasted and 2) arguably the best beer menu of any place in  Wisconsin, I was more that intrigued.

First, I sat at the bar waiting for my customer to arrive.  It was very busy for 5:30pm on a Wednesday night.  As the night went on, this place never came off a wait for a table.  It is not a small place - perhaps 20 tables.  There are a couple of really long high-top tables in the restaurant that are perfect for larger groups.

The bar menu changes quite often - lots of local WI beers.  I tried a cider and it was great, but served in a smallish glass.  The bar tender (guy with a beard) was attentive and sassy to other patrons.  He yakked it up when a girl wouldn't try the cheese curds.  Trust me - they are a awesome.

The cheese curds are fried in a light tempura batter.  They are served with a ranch dip like none other.  It is not a huge bucket, although it is served in a tin pail - more like enough for 3-4 people.

I had the Oscar Ribeye - a nice slab of steak seated on planks of home fries with asparagus and crab on top.  Over it all was the most wonder hollandaise sauce.  Definitely a meal to go with a hearty beer (or two! :)

This place was so good that when my coworkers wants to go to lunch the next day after our meeting, I suggested we go to this place, since they could not meet me the night before.

Of course, we got the cheese curds again.  I had the roasted brussel sprout salad.  It is served with a warm bacon dressing.

Kim was absolutely great.  Many thanx for great service!. First, a shameful admission. I don't like ice cream.

Those previous five words have gotten me responses ranging from loathing to pity. Gelato, milkshakes, water ice, fro-yo, and other cold concoctions? Fine by me. But I'm utterly apathetic to ice cream. However, there is one, and only one, exception that I've tasted. The sole ice cream I will gladly seek out is Dave and Andy's.

Dave and Andy's creation hits all the high marks, from flavor to texture to temperature. The ice cream here truly tastes of what it's supposed to without being overwhelming. Everything has a malty backbone which adds a unique savory sweetness to each flavor. The ice cream here isn't served excessively cold, and the texture is creamy without slickness. The killer waffle cones are homemade and complement the malty sweetness of the flavors very well. Even the low fat yogurt is awesome.

The lines can get long, but they move fast. Prices are reasonable given the quality, but bring cash. They also make a mean ice cream cake. Stop by and see if it's worth the hype (spoiler alert: it is).. Great first time experience...food tasted fresh and great! I had the crazy Alfredo and it was done very nicely...Will go back definitely. Baoding is the best Chinese food in Southpark. That being said I think it is a little overpriced, but not overpriced enough to stop me from having it every other week.. Since moving to the area last month, I've been trying to locate another Wings place nearby that matches up to the tasty ones from Hoagies and Wings in Sherman Oaks.  Buffalo Wild Wings can definitely fill those shoes.

There were a couple of BWW in the Valley in CA that I knew about, but I never gave them a try simply because I was already happy with the food and service at that other place.  I tend to be very loyal to a restaurant once I find one I like.  

This BWW is, literally, less than a mile from our house, so we gave it a shot.  The wings were meaty, the chicken club sandwich was juicy, and the Southwestern Chicken flip that my girlfriend got was delicious.  The service was also very good, albeit a little TOO friendly at times - made it seem as if we were being served by some wings cultists looking for recruits or something.  That's not a complaint (as overly good service is always preferred over the alternative) - it's just that they didn't need to try so hard.

We've definitely found our local wings restaurant.. I am embarrassed to find that I have not written a review of this place earlier. :(

People rave about the macarons. I can tell you that they are fantastic and I have had every flavor that they regularly keep in the case. Read the other reviews -- they're dead on. If you are looking for macarons in the U.S., look no further. 

There was a time when I was working with a client and I came to Essence at least once a week. When the staff know you and the owner comes over to introduce herself, you know you're there quite a bit. Eugenia was very nice and talked to me about how I liked the food and coffee -- I think she also wanted to know why I was coming by so much, too. During that time, I had everything on the posted breakfast menu, including some of the specials offered at that time. I never had anything bad. Not even close. Keep in mind that they do cook their eggs in the European style, so they might seem underdone if you like your eggs "American-dry." 

What I really want to talk about is THE CROISSANTS. I love croissants -- not the ones with all kinds of stuff packed inside, just the PLAIN ones. I had an opportunity to go to Paris last year and I ate a lot of pastries there. The croissants at Essence are at least as good as anything I found in Paris, and I would argue that they are better.

I have been fortunate enough to arrive when the plain croissants at Essence were still warm. Not reheated warm, but just-out-of-the-oven warm. If you ever need an excuse to get up before the sun and wait at a door, this is it -- remember the old Mervyn's commercial: "open, open, open..."? If I could make croissants like this, or if I lived closer than the 30-minute drive it takes me now, I would easily weigh 300+ lbs. 

I don't know what witchcraft they use to create the perfect plain croissant: tender in the middle and crunchy on the outside, but they are consistently perfect. (Just make sure you eat them on the day you buy them. ANY croissants will show their age and not be as fresh even a day later). They also make chocolate and chocolate+almond. There may also be an almond, but I get distracted easily by the pile of plain ones and can't hand over the cash fast enough to get one of those. 

For what it is worth, the macarons I had in Paris from the top two companies there (so I am told, at least) were not as good as the ones here. The macarons at Essence are light but have a substance to them. The "cookie" part of the macaron has a bit of chew to it. The ones I had in France were so light they felt like they would fall apart into dust if you breathed on them. There was nothing to chew since they simply dissolved. 

The place is small and it gets VERY crowded at peak times, but there are some seats on the patio if you want to sit outside. Parking can be a challenge since the lot is small and shared by a few restaurants AND a Starbuck's Drive-Thru.. A super clean, and friendly store with a great selection of vape liquids and supplies !!!. Breakfast done right! Friendliest staff I have ever come across. Very knowledgeable servers and everyone smiles crazy concept. I had the biscuits and gravy which rival the best I have ever eaten. Huge pieces of bacon and sausage. I also tried the breakfast burrito which was really good. When I'm out in Vegas again I know where I am getting breakfast. Thanks!. Yummy frozen custards.  The prices are kind of expensive at $6 a serving.  

The store is a small hut and you order at the counter and eat outside.  The surrounding area is pretty ghetto.  While we were eating a bum approached us twice and asked for change.

Luv it frozen custard - $5.75 (the first item) - Solid 4/5
-Custard had nice consistency & was yummy.  Served w/ cherries, small nuts, and cherry syrup.

TIPS:
-Cash only
-Area is pretty ghetto.
-No seating.  Order at a counter and eat at the street.
-Located across the street from Viva Las Arepas (A solid Venezualan restaurant.  Check that out too) =). Ate here while going to some movies at Cinemark 16 - it is the closest eating establishment in walking distance and I have to say, the food was fresh, and delicious! I had the gyros plate and the well, pocketless pita bread, and I know tha is not the name of it, was also soft and fresh - and they gave plenty of shaved gyro meat. You also get of a bottle of he Tzakziki sauce to put on the gyro of your choice. 

I also had the Dolmades and I thought they were excellent, just a hint of mint, which maybe is part the rice and a nice chunk of feta cheese to nibble on between dolmas.

All in all a nice example of this sort of establishment.. Ive been to this location a couple times and the pizza is good, but the WINGS are AWESOME! They are the best wings I have found at a pizza joint. The garlic knots are also great. I would still prefer other pizza places to this one though.. Good and the offer made it worth it. Might want to turn on the AC. I have ate here on a daily basis for more than 6 months now and have received extraordinary service each time. The staff is fast and friendly. I'm lucky to have such a great place to each lunch so close to work.. Called them on a Sunday at 2:20pm, technician arrived by 3:15. He was friendly and diagnosed the problem, gave me an estimate and it was fixed by 4:15. I would recommend them, I appreciate the speed and quality of the repair. The house feels great.. Really think this place brings for their cost, speed, quality and location.  Their food is very good and reasonably priced and always cooked fresh upon your order.  The kitchen is extremely clean and makes you feel good about what you are eating.

The chicken is fantastic as is the falafel, salads and hummus.  The fries leave a little to be desired but you really shouldn't be ordering those at a place like this.

This is not a place that you would bring a date to or be looking for a night out.  If you are looking for quality food at slightly higher than Subway prices than this is the place for you.  Also if you haven't had this type of food before this is a great intro to it and unless it is very busy the staff will offer you a sample.. This review if for Weekday Lunch Time for Breakfast prices during March 2012.  

Aria Buffet is indeed overpriced, but it is good to come here right before 11am during the weekday to eat lunch for breakfast prices cause the breakfast price (~17) is too expensive for just breakfast food and the crabs and sushi comes out at 11am. 

The Good:  
Modern Chic Design and clean interiors. 
The sushi (salmon/tuna nigiri) and several rolls are actually decent quality for a buffet.  
The crabs are served cold, but you can hand your plate of crabs to a server behind the counter and they will steam it for you. 
Garlic Naan Bread and curry dishes over jasmine rice is very good.
Cuts of meats - Prime Rib, Pork Belly have always been good. 
Desserts - Very good even though the selection may be small, I usually end up taking 3-4 cakes)
Coffee is also quite good. 
The line is usually shorter than most Buffets. 

The Bad:
Way too Expensive for Lunch, Dinners and Weekend Brunch.  
Cashiers have always been quite rude.  
Selection is small and there are no unique entrees.. As numerous people have pointed out, Walter's is indeed a great repair shop.  Tim (Walter is his last name) and the rest of his staff are friendly, honest, professional, and reliable.  I highly recommend this shop for repairs, maintenance, and check ups.  

However, they are victims of their own awesomeness.  The waits here can be long--2 weeks or more--due to how busy they are and they only have one bay.  If you do have a pressing safety concern though, Tim is always willing to take your car for a spin or do a quick diagnosis to let you know if something needs to be taken care of.. The best Banh Mi we've had since visiting Vietnam. One of the owners is from central Vietnam so the food is authentic. High-quality and fresh ingredients. The Banh Mi was big enough for two of us to share and at $6 a huge bargain. Had the BMB Special which had grilled pork, fried egg and pate in addition to the fresh toppings. The Green Papaya Salad was also delicious with a few shrimp on top. I wish this place was in my neighborhood, I'd be a regular.. Lee is experienced, kind and professional. I've been getting my haircut from in a variety of styles for over 8 years. He is the best in the state, hands down.. Just tried their $5.45 lunch special. Got the Kung Pao Chicken and it came with rice, Hot N Sour Soup and small Spring Roll. Kung Pao was pretty good and the soup was excellent. Great place to eat lunch quick and cheap.  The service was great and very friendly. I have gone twice now and will be back.  I used to go to the Grand China on W. Ann Road for their lunch specials but they have slipped lately and don't seem as good as they were?. My favorite of all the Hickory Taverns in Charlotte. Great atmosphere, plenty of room in both the dining room and bar, great beer selection, and always a place to watch any sporting event on TV. The food is good, especially the oysters, salads, and tacos. The only potential drawback is the staff. You'll either get somebody who is experienced and great, or somebody who is struggling. It's definitely a place to check out, especially if you're looking for a laid back place that can handle a group or want to catch a game on TV.. The next time you're craving for a unique way to have coffee, please come visit this place.. Found Kent on Yelp like many others. We were not disappointed. He works fast and clean. We initially hired him to switch out a vanity top in the bathroom, we were so pleased we asked him to do the other bathroom as well. Price is fair to say the least, and Kent is good people as well, which always helps. We won't hesitate to call him again in the future. it's nice to have someone we can trust to get things done, when we need them.. Interesting the negative reviews, it seems they are inconsistent right now.  Wifi was fixed, staff was clean, hotel was fairly clean.  I had a great experience.  They had two hockey teams in for a tournament, plus whatever else to sell out the hotel.  but, they still got us an early check-in, and late check-out.  Yeah, ok, I noticed the emergency exit signs had not been dusted.  But, our room was clean, the lobby seemed clean.  I will say, they had used some white/cream carpet upstairs in the foyer area - showed dirt really bad, but I think that was a carpet selection, not a cleaning, issue.  Outdoor pool was heated - it was nice.

Only issue - I am not sure if I have stayed at nicer DoubleTrees, or they are changing the brand standard, but the "restaurant & bar" were not much above a Best Western.  The breakfast was only a buffet, and the "restaurant" was really just a bunch of tables in a hidden away part of the lobby.  The staff in the restaurant was great, but it was not what I have seen in the past from DoubleTree.  I am used to separate, dedicated areas.  Maybe I am begind on brand standards.  It's like three minutes from San Tan Village, and they have several places open until 2 am, so we were still able to meet friends somewhere to drink.

Totally would stay here again.. Here's what happened... I blacked out, got punched in the stomach and left with a few dollars less in my bank account.

It sounds terrible, I know, but it was my fault for eating too much. There were way too many things on the menu that I wanted to try so I ended up getting the Del Rey. That sandwich is F-ing loaded! I mean, I'm all about excess sometimes with my food, but this thing has almost everything that you could want from a Mexican joint overflowing in between two halves of bread. Ya only live once though so I went for it, and it was very delicious! I've seen a similar torta on No Reservations in Frisco, but never knew that there was one in the valley. I'm glad I got to try it! Now, because of Man vs Food, most people will only go for the Del Rey. I would like to vouch for the quesadillas there though; they were also excellent! Their salsas are great as well, I just wish they had tortilla chips to go with em! Oh, and did I mention the agua frescas?! Amazing! 

It's a great little spot and I'm very glad that a tv show can help out local businesses the way that it does. I'm going to be moving a lot closer to Los Reyes, so I'll probably be in there more often in months to come.. If you are going to see a movie in Arizona, the way to go is Harkins, and that is why it seems like they own 75% of the theaters in this town now. The loyalty cup with its continuous year long 1$ drinks is awesome and saves so much money when going to the movies. As for The Camelview, this theater which is maybe the oldest one still open without major  renovation in the state, is the one place where you can truly sit back and watch good, award winning, indie movies. The seating is not stadium and theaters 3,4 & 5 are quite small, but the movies they show don't get shown anywhere else in the state, or at least they get them weeks before the wide release. I saw Slumdog Millionaire, Doubt, The Reader, Milk, as well as others here before they were out anywhere else in state. in the past this was the first place to show There Will Be Blood, Little Miss Sunshine, The Savages, and the list goes on. Its thanks to this theater that half these movies even show in Arizona. Thanks Harkins. Love this theater and all the films it shows.. The caprasrami is what you should get! Go large for 20" of this bad boy. 

My wife and I thought it was really good.

The salty, hot pastrami mixed with a tangy, cold slaw on a soft philly roll does it.

I'm assuming this is a Philly staple because they serve tasty kakes.

Since there are multiple locations off the strip, there's no excuse to not try this place!

My only complaint is that it could have had more meat...there's never too much meat!. I'm as laid back as it gets, so I'll start with the only miniscule, meaningless gripe I had with the Trump International Las Vegas.

I had booked a 2 BR Strip View Suite and decided to head over at 2 PM despite getting into McCarren at 10 AM.  They have you check in at the VIP area just off the main registration desk and, upon my arrival, the room was cleaned and ready to go.  The only hold-up was that a 'higher up' needs to inspect that room prior to checking in and I waited 40 minutes until someone inspected it.

I didn't really care at all aside from wanting to get out of the clothes I traveled in and to get the room situated, but my feeling was that a 'VIP' should get priority over the little people in the world (like, say, the people who booked a regular room or even a 1 BR).  This room wasn't cheap and it was degrading seeing the other people carrying their bags to their hotel room before me.

I was totally kidding about that last bit, so give me a break.

All I can say about this place is that it's hard to get a Five Stars for anything.  'Robocop' is Five Stars.  Many 'Gin's' are Five Stars.  I don't know what a hotel would have to do to get it, but I can say that I've been going to Las Vegas three + times a year for nearly two decades and this was the nicest room I'd ever stayed in.

64th Fl, smack-dab looking south down the middle of Las Vegas Blvd.  Aside from not having a CD player or a MP3 player that could connect to the newest generation of ipod, it had every amenity and so much space.  Probably too much space for a couple of drunkard college buddies, but I'd look to book this room every time I'm back in town.

The hotel is immaculate and the employees across the board couldn't be better, nicer or more accommodating.

The closest casino is the Wynn/Encore, but I walked/stumbled to and from as far south as Paris without issue.  You're in Vegas, you're going to walk (they have courtesy shuttles to Wynn and to Caesars).  The Riviera and the Gold Standard of trashy casinos, Circus Circus, is just a quick skip north.

I highly recommend this place.  I've read some reviews and people have spoke of trains (never heard one although I wasn't on the side of the hotel I believe that affects) and the valet service not being fast enough 9didn't have a car)...but I think people are just high maintenance.

Can't wait to stay here again.. Very fresh pasta, wonderful carpaccio, great service, neat atmosphere. We got royal treatment and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. We hope to be back.. I am no coffee connoisseur, but one can clearly taste the difference between chain coffee places and this place,  the coffee tastes fresh, they make it how you want it, and it tastes a lot richer. The staff is very friendly and are knowledgeable in everything they sell. The vibe of the place is very relax and inviting.  I recommend it specially if you need a break from the shopping at the quarter.. Went ATVing with my homies for my bachelor party and went with American Adventure Tours. What an amazing experience. Flying thru the desert along their trails was a rush and at the same time kind of serene. In the middle of nowhere with good friends while gaining a new appreciation for the desert and riding ATVs, will be a memory that lasts forever. 

I would highly recommend this to anyone.. Be prepared to wait for a table, it seems like it's always rammed.

We went between 2 and 3 pm and were told it would be about 45 mins to an hour wait. It ended up being closer to 30 minutes. The hostess was really unfriendly, but the waitress we had was great.

We tried the oxtail fries which I liked. Everything on the menu is very unique.

The burgers I saw coming out while waiting all looked really "pretty" and the meat patties looked tasty. I ordered the $25 shogun burger, with eel and foie gras on it. It wasn't incredible, but it was definitely interesting and new to me and I enjoyed it. My friends ordered the ronin burger and the lonely bird burger and they both loved it. 

I like how the menu has such unusual burgers and I'd like to try more.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Came back again and tried chili fried chicken. It's made with a mix of chili, ginger, garlic and soy sauce, and tastes exactly like what you'd get if you mixed all those together. I think it was ok, the dipping sauce had a unique flavor.

Also had the sweet potato fries, which I think came with the same or similar sauce as the chili chicken did. The fries were cooked well, but tasted pretty much the same as sweet potato fries anywhere else.

Had the ronin burger this time, which had a very similar dark sauce flavor that the shogun burger had. I think i'd prefer the ronin over the shogun just because the shogun is a mix of such unusual flavors, and the ronin is closer to a regular burger.. Great place to go and have a beer, good food and overall a great time. We are there almost on a biweekly status and they never let us down.. Pretty darn good lunch combo. gyoza and fat chasu kyoto ramen. Dude. Seriously. Good eats. I like fast cars, fast women, and fast service. Honey Bears is just that. Err, i mean.. Whatev. The ever-so-popular BBQ Pork Sandwich was the juiciest its ever been today. Add the seasoned fries and wash'er down with the RC Cola with crushed ice. I say "Damn, son." Ima fixin' ta look at dem ribs ya'll talkin' 'bouts.  I turned southern all of a sudden.. I have sent my three step-children to their Summer camp and now get to experience my Biological Daughter (8) to Fern Adair. My daughter hates leaving the home but always states
can I have a friend over...I'm bored etc... She was scared to death about going to a camp and when it comes to attending something new she is frightened and scared to being introduced to something new. The staff and members of Fern Adair, made her comfortable, I have no idea what they said to her, but after day one our daughter could not stop talking about the program and how fun it was and when can she go back!

She even woke up at 6:30am to get ready for a amp that starts at 9am! That is how excited 
and thrilled she is about the amazing people and activities Adair Fern has to offer!
From Gymnastics, Hip-Hop, Ballet, Tap, Acting and Singing our daughter is being enriched with some amazing talent and culture that only Adair Fern can accommodate. They have a
3 week session and a 2 week session from 9am - 3pm and its worth every penny for the priceless memories and inspiration they bring to the table!

Thank you to the amazing staff and leadership of Adair Fern Conservatory of the Arts!. Best Indian Lunch Buffet.. Must try!!!. The Coffe Bean & Tea Leaf is one of the better chain coffee shops in town.  I personally am not a huge fan of starbucks regular coffee.  Their blended drinks are what makes them starbucks, but if you really want decent coffee you have to venture outside the norm.  Coffee bean & Tea leaf offers a nice selection of Tea & Coffee.

This particular location inside the Canyon Pointe shopping district across from Red Rock is awesome!  They have free WIFI like most coffee shops and a small, yet relaxing interior.  If you need your cup-o-joe give them a shot.. Great hospital! Nurses and doctors are amazing. Food needs improvement. But overall great experience. It's nice to find people I can trust. Ten stars for Chance and C.J. I broke the main water shut-off valve so I didn't have any water. I don't know any plumbers so I came to Yelp and found Pipe Dreams. Called Chance, they were here in about twenty minutes, no muss no fuss. This is what we do, this is what you need, this is what it will cost. Clean, professional, friendly, I will definitely have Chance come back for some more work I need done. Great job, guys!. I come here all the time and always have a great experience. My hands down favorite (served as a special for lunch) is the Burger with bacon and provolone, tomatoes and lettuce with the delicious pickle and spectacular Parmesan fries... Accompanied by a coke out of a glass bottle poured over ice. Yummm. The wife had surf & turf, her exact words "Best Lobster tail I ever had". And we also love the scallops wrapped in bacon, always perfectly prepared. Top notch service and a delicious cappuccino to finish it all off, even if you have no room for dessert. Enjoy!. Shout out to Lorena who helped me pick up my clothes today. Dropped off my clothes on Sunday shortly before they closed and was thrilled when they gave their first time customers 50% off then 20% after that. They have a super convenient pick up "ATM" where you provide them your credit card info. then you simply pull up to the ATM and pick up for clothes at what ever time you'd like. Also, they have a drive thru where you pull up and they come out and assist you without getting out your vehicle. Honestly, I've been reading the bad reviews, and the prices are reasonable for Las Vegas. Its similar to many of the dry cleaners I've been to especially on that side of town. 

However, my complaint would be on the hangers they use for dry cleaned items, where they use a bright orange "tide" paper that covers the hanger which can bleed onto the light colored shirts. Will be requesting a hanger with no tide paper next time.. This is a store for serious collectors who know what they're looking for and aren't scared to pay a premium for it.

If you're coming looking for new releases, re-issues, or just to idly browse, head somewhere else as this is NOT your usual record store.

To give you a sense of what I mean, nothing in the store has a price tag on it. Everything is tabulated at the register based on online demand. Don't be surprised if your bill runs into the hundreds or even thousands (seriously).

For a successful visit, come with a clear idea of what it is you're looking for, and lots of time to dig around for it. It's also a good idea to come with a budget of how much you want to spend - This can help when negotiating at the register. 

In fact, that is maybe the most important thing; Be prepared to negotiate on a price! Strangely this experience felt more like buying a car than buying records.

After all is said and done however, you'll be walking out with some unbelievable records that you might never have been able to find otherwise. 

Bottom line is if you're looking for rare records, this is the shop for you. Talk to the owner, be aware that it could get costly, be ready to make a deal, and you should be fine.. Glad I tried Merkato.  I've tried Abyssinia and now have another good option.  The neighborhood isn't the greatest, but if you can get past that, food is great and service was super friendly.

Had the veggie combo together with Fimi Tibs which is served on grill (like a fajita sizzling plate).  The girls working were both super friendly, happy to explain things, bring extra injera, and fill water.  

I'll definitely be back and look forward to trying some their chick pea (garbanzo bean) dishes.. Rick and Marsha know their craft well. They had exactly what I was looking for. Professional installation and beautiful workmanship with reasonable prices. I will use their services again!
 Gregg W., Buckeye, AZ.. Love their Wellness Drink! I haven't gotten the chance to try their food yet, but it's all about healthy eats and drinks here.. Restaurant was closed this evening due to our group renting the entire place for our sales convention. Fixed menu. Everything was excellent and flavorful, flank steak, potatoes mushrooms. Just not enough to go around the table.. Excellent customer service ! Manager made  things right and the food is great I work close by and this is our dealerships go to for take out breakfast.. By far and near as well, in'n'out has the best fast food burgers around. There burger sauce is especially goo on the fries and you can even ask for chili peppers! Not a fan of animal style because I like fresh onions, but animal style fries are a meal in itself. Go crazy with those carbs, otherwise make mine a double-double!. Mark is very a very patient and kind trainer. He was focused on teaching and training our lab commands that are important for a good baseline for our dog's future. I absolutely recommend Mark if you want your new family member to get off to a good start and if you want to learn what it takes to carry on the training after it has been completed.. Awesome. Great price for the all you can eat.  The "Man Whore" is a menu item must.. Sandwiches are great could use fresher foods but the service is great very nice people. Been a while since we've been back here as we decided to let our sodium levels drop back to normal. Certainly worth the wait.  Shrimp Po Boy was outstanding!. I strive to be comprehensively balanced on my reviews, but still it may come as a surprise to many that I'm giving 'O' only 3 stars (well actually 3.5... well now actually 4... see at the end)

There's a saying in Vegas, not "what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas."  Another saying something like, "We're in Vegas, lets go back some 'bad' decisions."  Cirque 'O' is probably the BEST bad decision you can make in Vegas in my opinion.

The show itself is 4.5 stars in my book.  The missing half star is because for me, the 'WOW' factor was not quite what I expected for the price of the ticket and the hype from all the other reviewers.  But nonetheless, the show can be appropriately described as spectacular.  One criticism I have is the stage is VERY deep so it can be hard to make out the characters in the back of the stage.  A small pair of binoculars (if you are sitting in back) would be a great tool to fully enjoy the amazing costumes.  Also I caution, that I would not recommend sitting in the first dozen or so rows.  Much of the show takes place high in the air, and you will have a much better perspective sitting about mid-way back.

So why only 3.5 stars?  The price.  Yes, yes, I know, everything in Vegas is about 80% overpriced nowadays.  It's the law of supply and demand and the theme of 'excess' rampant throughout the town.  But to me, that's no excuse for a mediocre value, and that is what 'O' is.  For $170 per person (unless you sit in the balcony or get a partially obstructed view) for a 1.5 hour show, it IS described at BEST a MEDIOCRE value.  That's $680 for a family of four.  You can do quite a few more interactive and cool and longer lasting activities for $680 for a family of four.  Think about it.

If money is virtually no object, 'O' is a no brainer.  But if you like to get some decent value for your entertainment dollar, you can maximize it with Cirque by managing your expectations going in which I didn't and that was my mistake and the partial fault of many other reviewers which seemingly have a lower 'amazement threshold' than myself.  To each their own though.

So where did I sit you ask?  After careful consideration, we chose the first row of the balcony and it was a good decision (yes I know it may be ironic I'm complaining about the value when I bought the $40 cheaper seats - but I'm writing the review considering the vast majority of the seats are the higher price.)  You will have to lean forward to look over the railing to see things that are happening in the very front of the stage and in the crowd.  The perspective is great, you are at eyes level with much of the show in the air and have a good perspective on the deeper area of the stage and see some of the synchronized swimming moves from a better elevated perspective, I would NOT sit in the balcony in any other row though as there is occasional action in the crowd below that is fun to watch that you can't see from the other rows in the balcony.  I think the best seats would be the first few rows of the "second/upper orchestra section" in the middle on either side of the controller area or the center of the Loggia (lower single row balcony). 

I'm a music lover and an MJ fan.  The music in 'O' was great but I think it could have been more exciting.  I honestly think I would probably enjoy the more immersive musical experience of Michael Jackson The One.  

I was about to hit submit with 3-stars rating but decided to round up realizing many readers may not realize that 3-star rating has a lot to do with value and isn't just a rating for the show itself so I've decided to weight it on the show itself and avoid the backlash of the others drunk on the Cirque Cool-Aid.. Yelp, thai delivery food and up came Thai House. Love online ordering! As of now. So I ordered from their main website, signed up, ordered and paid for bill by cc, easy and quick. Online ordering shows pictures of dishes n gives you options of spicyness, meats, and etc for certain dishes. 
We ordered 2 orders of chicken pad thai and an order of fried bananas. The c.pad thai was flavorful with a little sweet, kick. The fried bananas were delicious, had a nice crunch with sweet banana filling. 
Easy online ordering, good timing delivery and good chicken pad thai.. Best gym to go to. Two story, inside pool,outside quarter mile track and very clean place to go to. You have to make sure you go at the right time though because it could get a little busy at certain times during the day, way better than any other gym though.. I don't live in AZ, but when I'm in town, I always come here. Best Acai bowls I've had anywhere. As you approach Gooski's for the first time, surrounded by nothing else commercial at all, you're probably thinking "wow, this place is nestled DEEP in the neighborhood."  As you walk in, the good time vibe greets you, as does an utterly solid beer selection, including plenty of interesting picks from good cans to upscale bottles.  It can be a little hard to see the selections available on the mirror menu, so take your time deciding - just approach the bar with your order after you've chosen.  Saw a live show in the back here recently and dug the acoustics both in the back room and flowing into the pass-through to the bar.  The jukebox selections were dyn-o-mite, too.  Be prepared for indoor smoking, which almost feels like a throwback now.  The crowd can be hit or miss, but more likely to be an agreeable mix, and if you're able to get a seat, they're comfortable.   Really, if you make your way to Brereton, you're going to be rewarded with a good time and an enjoyable drink.  PS - if you drove over, just remember to disengage the parking brake at the end of the night before moseying home.. Great food. I would give it 5 stars if they took credit/debit cards.. Had a great experience shopping for a car.  Very transparent pricing with excellent customer service.  They had a great selection of cars compared to the other luxury dealerships in Madison.  I am going to buy my new Lexus there.

Thanks Lexus of Madison!. So what would happen if Hawaiian food and Chipotle conceived a love child? You guessed it, Frank Stallone!, oh, I mean Braddah's Island Style!! There is nothing that I've had here that I didn't like. It's definitely worth checking out for the great casual food.

I've heard lots of good things about this place but never tried it for various reasons. But hey, guess what? My little homie, you know him, his name is Groupon was like "hey mike, I got this great deal for you.." I was like "oh yea? What you got for me on this bright and beautiful day?" And he was like "listen to this, you gotta check out this place, it's called Braddah's Island Style, and I'll give you $12 bucks of food for only $6. What do you say?" I was like, "ok, you twisted my arm, but be a little bit more gentle next time because that kinda hurt, I shall take you up on your offer." And so our journey began.

It's really similar to Chipotle. You can either order a burrito, 3 tacos, a bowl, and a salad (just make sure it's not a tossed one). Then you order your meats and toppings. Go for the steak, it's worth it. Hey! Not really a steak eater? Well then young sir, there are also other options available such as pork, chicken, and fish. Oh, so now you don't eat animals. No problem my friend, because Braddah's has that base covered too. You can get some tofu. There you go.

These guys don't skimp on the toppings. I was so moved by their generosity that the tears almost, sorta, kinda, maybe decided to think that they were going to fall, but it wasn't the case.

I see you coconut bark, giving me the eye with your deliciousness. Looking all sexy in the corner over there. Oh, I'm heading your way soon enough. Just give me some time to get things situated with my situations, then we'll talk.

So go here. Now! J/k whenever you're up for it.. It was such a pleasure to go here! I had, or am still having, a rather bad case of Pink-Eye. After going to other doctors, and even the emergency room which was nothing but a painful experience, I finally found this business.

Doctor Mark Doubrava was not just very nice and competent, but went out if his way to actually run after my car since he discovered something that could be related to my eye infection! Have you ever seen that? A doctor that actually cares for his patients!

I will definitely go back here and have my prescription for my glasses renewed.

This business is a role model for all other doctors in this State!. Delicious burritos, that's all I've had because that's the first thing I ordered and haven't regretted it once yet.  Hot/spicy onions are addicting. Five stars for great atmosphere, great food and great beer! Order the wings grilled there the best. Service is excellent at the bar. Chicken fingers are beer battered which is also awesome. My wife and I drive out of our way to go here because it's so good! Trust me.. Neither of us ordered steak. I had the center cut pork chop cooked medium. It was heaven on a plate..juicy and the glazed chutney on the plate was devine. My wife had the king crab legs which came with clarified butter. Also heavenly. The wait staff was attentive without being intrusive and the general atmosphere was vibrant but not manic. Will definitely return.. Great burgers, we had the Bang Bang burger which is a classic american burger. It had fresh ground meat & the fires were hand cut.. They air condition the outside. The. Outside.

This is either the most amazing human accomplishment, or a sure sign of the coming apocalypse.

After enough of both the abundant frozen daiquiris and man candy on display, you really won't care which it is. Science! Doom! Daiquiri!. Typically a long wait for Sunday Brunch but the food is always awesome - one of the two places I will eat mussels in Pittsburgh. Really nice sized rooms, looks like recently updated.  Mini fridge is always nice touch and is located in closet.  The closet has light switch that illuminates when doors open!  We were told not single kings, and opted for double queens.  We requested higher level and got 32nd floor with awesome view of the south strip and mountains to the west.  The rooms are fairly quite and the blackout curtains cut out almost everything.  
The staff is a little pushy with housekeeping, they wait outside and jump at door when you leave.  I guess this is better than any other service here.  The staff is very friendly, and yeah you're stuck a high resort fee.  But the location is great, short deuce (bus) rides to almost everything.  Twenty minutes to freemont st and new york new york, if you drive you can go off strip and get here very easily (AVOID STRIP at all costs).
I'd come back here.

Do yourself a favor and eat only breakfast at buffet.  Their are better eats all around you than their restraunts and bars. Lee's Auto Care is the place in Las Vegas to take your vehicles for maintenance and repair. Honest, friendly, reliable, highly competent and fair pricing is what you'll get. From Cindy at the front desk, to the guys in back all the way up to the owner Lee himself, this is a friendly staff that will treat you right. I found Lee's Auto Care from friends that have been around Las Vegas for a long-time and have been using him for years. Now I know why. If you are looking for an honest, friendly competent automotive professional stop looking. You found the place, Lee's Auto Care. Please do yourself a favor and bring your vehicles here! You'll be happy you did.. Best place for pizza!! Bruschetta is fresh and delicious! Spicy feta is an original dish I have never had elsewhere! Out of this world!. Growing up in Texas I've had more than my share of steak (particular Prime Rib). At the request of a personal friend (also a Chef) I decided to dine at Firebirds just for the Prime Rib. After having my server check to see if they had "true rare" Prime, I ordered it. 
All that I can really say is that if you love beef the way I do, you wont be disappointed the least bit. I would even venture to say that it's in the top 3 best Prime I've ever experienced...including the one I make myself!. Really cool place. It is like a resort pool bar without the resort. Some of the crowd is a little pretentious, but it is a great environment and the food is good. Service is very good except when it gets crowded (which is often).. I love this place. 

I don't really buy in to the environmentally-friendly hype unless I'm pulling a tomato off a plant in my own yard, but I love Fresh & Easy because of their:
-50% off rack. Great prices for delicious food that is still perfectly edible for many days.
-Inexpensive products. Among other things, I like to stock up on their organic soups and sometimes buy their ready-made meals. 
-Fantastic packaging. It's refreshingly simple.

It is FREEZING cold in here, though. And sometimes I just want to buy one onion, not a bag of six..... Great place for excellent steaks and seafood. Similar to Capital Grille Flemings or Ruth Chris. Excellent quality food service drinks and atmosphere. Can't go wrong.. Having now sampled the food here I can safely say that the meatloaf is a good bet & the rest of the menu read pretty enticingly too.

Service on the December night I was in turned out to be a bit ropey with wrong drinks being served both to me and other customers - a combination of new staff & others distracted by beer reviewers and the inevitable questions the place's range illicits. Obviously not a regular occurence but something to keep in mind.. This place is pretty good. The burro I got was huge and the beans tasted fresh and homemade. The rice was pretty good as well. They also conveniently give you free chips if you dine in. The only bad thing was one of the people I was with ordered tacos and asked for one with carne asada in it but didn't get it. Other then that, it was delicious!. I wasn't disappointed. 1/2 lobster comes with the buffet. Crab legs are cut lengthwise for easy access. Dessert bar is amazing. Wine is complementary. I haven't been to many buffets, so I guess I'm not that picky. Definitely got my money's worth.. Delicious! Very homely with simple dishes. Relatively priced with a good aroma. 5 stars easy.. Cleanliness: 5 Stars
The front of the restaurant smells and appears very clean and sanitary. This small shop definitely takes pride in ownership

Hospitality: 5 stars
The staff was smiling and greeted me with a welcome. I used their call ahead order service and was impressed with the friendliness and promptness received.  

Food: 5 Stars
The portions are large and made fresh to order. All our meals were hot and came accurate.

Overall:
This place is great for a "quick" meal and more affordable than a traditional sit down restaurant. I would recommend to others looking for non-traditional Mexican food on the go this is a good option.. Great chill spot! Definitely hipster.

The staff is super awesome. Great place to have a coffee and chill, write, or for dinner. The food (very vegan friendly!) is really good and a great price.

Glad to see this spot still around when I visit back home.. Purchased a Martini glass full of fruit delivered to my wife for her birthday on the advice of a friend. The owner, Cameron, is local and has several if not all of these stores. If the deal was ok I would have been happy knowing I'm doing business locally and not shipping money out of state (feel broke? Wall Street enjoys our money very much and I miss it terribly, especially when it used to come with tips and comps). Not only was the arrangement beautiful and on time, it blew my wife away and was delicious for two days. I highly recommend the sea salt caramel wrapped apples. Sooooo, quality product, priced right, delivered on time, helpful staff and locally owned. What more could you ask for? If there was any criticism, Cameron told me to ask for Debbie who was not there and the fellow who took my order had no idea what they sold, only to input a product number that I found on the internet. The picture there sold me and I could tell him the product number, but it seemed strange that I could ask for the martini glass arrangement and he not know what I meant, but then I went to the website just now to find the name and what I bought isn't there any more and there's a whole mess of new products, so maybe my criticism is undeserved. A happy wife is a happy life, thanks Cameron and Debbie!!. Pretty typical Firehouse Subs here... the only exception is that you are probably used to driving up to a location, parking, and walking in.  Since this Firehouse is in the EpiCenter... depending on where you are coming from, park in the EpiCenter Parking Deck and take an elevator up.  Since I work downtown and walk everywhere, I usually just use my two feet to get here.

When you walk in, you are instantly greeted by the friendly folks that work here and also the smells of sandwiches and other hot subs they are preparing.  You have to make your way to the back to order at the registers.  The line usually moves pretty fast, unless you have those folks that can't decide what they want and just stand there staring at the large menu on the wall.  

Like all Firehouse locations, this one has a Coca Cola Machine that lets you choose your drink creation....  I usually try something new other than the regular flavors of soda.   Strawberry Sprite isn't bad.

Your sandwich comes out in a couple of minutes and you are chowing down in no time.  A decent lunch option.

Lately they have been asking to "round up" your total amount so that the change can be used for charity.  Pretty smart - you can easily say no too... they don't put pressure on you at all.. Great dining experience.  The food is good, but the service is excellent!. Great little place for early breakfasts or a cup of coffee on the go. 

They actually have coffee that tastes like coffee wich can be hard to find in the U.S for a european.  That is if you pick the dark roasted coffee. 

The bagels are freshly baked and the condiments tasty. 
Try the one with jalepeno bread, jalepeno cream cheese and sprinkles of salty bacon on top and thank me later.  

Oh and they have good speed free wi-fi too.. Best and most expensive buffet I've ever been to.  Around $70.
Been here many times over the years.  I agree with VA F. that it is too bad the price went up AND the quality went down a bit.  The unlimited high quality alcohol is probably the real justification for the price.
Make a reservation - the wait can be long.  However, they've opened up 2 adjacent restaurants for seating room, so it is no so bad anymore.  You just have to walk a ways to the food.
So, the best part about this buffet is the great champagne and sake.  Very high quality.  You need to keep drinking to make sure it is worth the price (like cheng K, who finished 3 bottles! amazing.)  I can only manage 1 bottle and several sake shots.
One time I had some pasta with real truffled sauce - it was heavenly.
Unlimited caviar - though I don't think I like it too much.  The lobsters they have are the cheaper 1/2 pounders - presplit so all the favors are leeched out.. We tried this place while on the strip in vegas. It was a Wednesday night and it was packed. The restaurant has ample seating, but even so, we were lucky in finding a spot on this visit.

I ordered a veggie mushroom burger(trying to step out of the box) cheese fries and a peanut butter and chocolate concrete. First off, the burger was abit on the small side for the cost. My first bite was just bread and the mushroom, which has good flavor, but abit dry. On the second I got the cheese and that was an amazing bite. The cheese fries were delicious and spot on. The desert was ok, not bad but definitely not the best shake type dessert I've ever had.

The food here was good and worth a visit for. They also have a large selection of draft beers to choose from. I will probably return if I'm back in vegas.. I wasn't quite sure what to expect when reading a fact in my guidebook to Montreal that this restaurant featured three levels and could literally seat hundreds of people.

Would this prove to be a land-based cruise ship of bland, ordinary food served en masse? Would people be lining up for slop? 

Fortunately my exaggerated concerns did not come to fruition. On the contrary, we were seated right by the window with a stunning view of the beauty that is Vieux Montreal. Quite a few happy strollers licking their ice cream cones marked our meal.

Upon entering this restaurant , you'll observe fairly dim lighting in a bar area with a flight of stairs leading to the other levels. Yes, there are levels but that's no reason to worry. The overall space is large but each room feels comfortable, cozy and exists in its own self-contained world of carnivore treats.

The Table d'hote is a French phrase you should commit to memory. It's a meal with several courses where some of the key components change on a daily basis. Sort of like prix-fixe but with an element of surprise.

My $30 dinner consisted of a mesclun salad with a honey dijon dressing, lamb chops and a slice of chocolate mousse cake. (Although technically the menu said "lamb shops". What does a lamb shop for? I won't complete the punch line. )

Now the salad was a mere footnote to the delicious lamb chops. Three juicy chops with enough meat on them to satisfy my cravings. Obviously, this is a steakhouse so you could just as easily order Angus pride AAA Canadian beef cuts like t-bone, tenderloin, striploin and bavette steak.

Besides the flavor of the lamb chops what sticks in mind most clearly  was the exceptional service. Our waiter had no trouble showing us several lobsters so my wife could identify the perfect specimen. It was like Goldie Locks and the three lobsters-- 2 and 1/4 pounds was just right!

The chocolate mousse cake was an enjoyable way to end the meal.

There's a traditional cocktail menu as well, mainly of classics without that much experimentation. Think black russians , margaritas and manhattans. The wine list is geographically dispersed with choices from Canada, France, the US, South Africa, Italy and more.

If you are staying in Vieux Montreal or just passing through for the day, a stop by the Restaurant du Vieux Montreal is tres bon.. I took my five year old skating for the first time. While trying to teach her to skate I noticed an advertisement for the now, Little Howlers, program. I inquired and was surprised that they offer free skating lessons to kids for 4 Saturdays during the month. This includes skates, helmet, all pads, and a jersey. You can  take your kid to practice in between classes and they won't get hurt while wearing the equipment. 

A big thanks to the Coyotes who sponsor the class and make this happen. 

The staff is really amazing, friendly, and helpful. My daughter is very shy so I have been getting her involved in a lot of activities to try and break her shy barrier. I expected her to cry but what I wasn't expecting was the personalized attention she got from one of the ice skating coaches, Michelle Clarke. Thanks to Michelle my daughter absolutely loves ice skating. Many thanks to the other coaches who are teaching as well. She can't stop talking about going back.. Yesterday was the second time I have enjoyed pizza from Sunset Pizzeria. I waited to after this last time to post my review just in-case the first time was a fluke. I don't give out 5-stars very easily especially since I am a Pizza Snob. Anyway, now I am now a fan. 

The thing that stuck me was lack of grease the pepperoni had. Usually when you order a pepperoni pizza, there is a huge grease puddle at the bottom of the box. Don't get me wrong, I used to love my pizza like I loved my women, hot, fresh, and a little greasy! Now that I am older and have more common sense, I still like hot and fresh pizza, but I can do without the heart-attack juice.. It is depressing  that my favorite hotdog in the place is named after that nut in OhiO. I always order it ny number. :) Has pork belly (bacon!), corn relish, cheddar  and garlic Mayo. mmmmm. Got the chefs sampling menu.  $85 dollars for 6 courses.  Added the wine tasting for another $ 40 . Need 2 people at table to both get this. 

Let me tell you this was a FANTASTIC DEAL.  Started with nice diced tuna tartare.  Super fresh . Bit of creme fresh and caviar.  Nice size portion. Then comes one large sauteed scallop wrapped in proscuitto.  Bit of sauce.  Perfect.  Then a small portion of a homemade tube pasta with a meat ragu sauce.  This was one of the best I have ever had. Perfectly cooked pasta, so fresh it was still evolving.  I could have been done eating right here, but then comes the sea bass.  Two nice pieces of roasted fish on top of several large artichokes with a great sauce.  I'm bad and cant remember the sauces- sorry to much wine- but they were all perfect matches for the dish.  Then comes the meat.  Two full size lamb chops. Tasting menu?  Way more than at taste!  Perfectly cooked, fantastic sauce and some awesome scalloped potatoes.  Way to much food. But then... you get a choice of deserts.  full size portion no less and each person can order which one they want .  Delicious finish. 

 And the wine parings.  I'm not talking about one sip of wine with each course.  I'm talking about a half a glass ( and in some cases what might even be a full glass compared to what some places now call a glass!).  All Italian of course and all really quite good.  Each one was expertly paired with the dishes.  Very impressive.

Service was good to excellent. A lot of these vegas high end places have trouble with consistent service. I'm guessing lots of turnover and hard to train folks for high end service, but really had nothing to complain about.  

Restaurant has a great setting overlooking Bellagio lake (if you get a table close enough to the windows).

All in all worth every penny and then some.   I'll be back...

Ciao Baby. Not much places you can find ramen in AZ. Republic Ramen or Tonkatsu is great, always get one of the two. The sides are small, too small and not worth getting in my opinion.. Taco al pastor is very good.  Mole Pablano is very good. Great service and prices that can't be beat for a downtown restaurant. All food is super fresh and the place is very clean. I peeked in the kitchen...spotless.  go here.. #BAW

I have enjoyed my time with the Wildflower Bread Company; especially the support provided to me over the course of my time with, Louis, Jim, Brad and Janine at all the AM meetings.

We change lives, create traditions, build community and feed the soul with passion, every time, every day.

This is the best week of the whole year.. We were in a hurry and let server know.  He was very understanding and put our order in quick. Food was good.. We have visited this place three times this month. Typically we like the people or the food, but here we have really been enjoying both. We drive 90 minutes each way. :)

We came by around thanksgiving for the first time with a party of six including a pair of six year olds. The service was top notch. The waitress was SUPER nice to our kids and Sam the manager was warm, personable and engaging while he helped us navigate the menu. Since then we have been hooked. 

Everything is locally and sustainably sourced but the prices are still very reasonable. 

The kale salad is our favorite appetizer. It's somewhat akin to guacamole dip but has an interesting and unique flavor. 

The bison burger is probably my favorite thing on the menu. It's easy to over-cook bison but his was excellent (I ordered it medium-rare). 

Sea bass tacos were good too. We split the entree and ordered four - two each. The bass was perfectly cooked, but I was surprised by how good the beans that came with the tacos were. 

For drinks my favorite is the ginger drink that I think was called "the natural". I prefer it warm. 

Dessert is definitively the highlight though. My wife likes the chia seed pudding and I LOVE the squash pie. It's like a pumpkin pie but more flavorful and the crust is sweet without being overwhelming. 

Thanks to Sam and the team for a great experience. We will be back soon. :). Great company for repairs on older boats. Their shop may look dated, but the team has great service and does a great job. If you have an older boat in the Las Vegas area this is a great place to get work done.. A new breakfast option in old town Scottsdale. The decor is superb and the weekend crowd is minimal. Juevos Rancheros and the Skirt Steak & Eggs are both fabulous. Prices for breakfast are reasonable.. I LOVE this place! Every trip I take to vegas I have to stop by here.. Its truly amazing!  Must try!!!. This has to be the best gelato ever! The owner is italian and they actually went back there to learn how to make it. After we first went I think we drove back like ten times in two weeks.. Great prices, tasty food and friendly staff. Rosalva was very kind and attentive. The environment made me feel like I was back in Medellin. Large menu selection. I will be back.. Best wings in town, they also have a great ranch dressing.  The fries are good and there are several seasonings for the fries, but my  favorite is the cheese sauce for them.. Unbelievable!  When you drive by this little, and I mean little, place on Broadway, if you blink you will miss it.  But turn around and prepare to enjoy some of the best Thai Food you will ever have!  The Panang Red Curry with Shrimp was so fabulous, it made my eyeballs sweat!  The Vegetable Egg Rolls were equally amazing,  The dining room is incredibly small due to the size of the building, but every table was full of happy guests.  There was a line waiting to sit, and another line out the door for pick up orders.  If you're in the area, stop by and enjoy.. The experience i had have at Choice has been amazing.  The Emotional Intelligence course has opened up my eyes in a better perspective on how I approach things in life.  This program is something that you only receive maximum value if you put maximum effort.  So, it;s possible for someone to go thru the program very unwilling, hoping that the program would fix them.  There's also the possibility that a person that go in open-minded and have desire to make their life better in however many ways they choose to.  The age range inside goes from 18-70+, with all different kinds of people and professions.  

The results I have been able to achieve are:
-Re-establishing/enhancing 4 relationships in my life.  My brother, 2 of my closest friends, and my cousin
-Create an extra $1,000 a month in income. Wait! Taco Tuesday.  $20 for 2 adults, 1 child. 5 total tacos, 1 kids meal, and chips and salsa.....tacos were definitely worth the  $2 per taco. Plus a bucket of chips and salsa. Definitely will return for Taco Tuesday.. Wow, this place is AWESOME!!!! This is another place you'll go and feel like you're in one of the great Steak houses of New York or Chicago. There is enough variety of seafood and meat dishes on the mwnu to satisfy even the most particular palate. 
This all comes at a price, as Mastro's takes the a la carte concept to a new level. You will pay additional for any side-unless a sizzling hot dish (DON'T TOUCH-YOU WILL BURN YOURSELF) of meat, with NOTHING else is all you crave. 
That being said, the sides are more than generous with each side being plenty for up to three or four people. 
You would be hard pressed to find a more tender or succulent piece of filey anywhere in town. The service is good, the atmosphere nice and fancy. There is a decent three person band providing entertainment, and more than one Scottsdale Cougar was cutting a rug. 
This is really a fancy, top-dining spot. Classy atmosphere, great food good service. You could not go wrong here if you're in the mood to splurge on dinner. You will want to undo your belt a knotch or two though before you leave as you will be full!. Great crew. 

Awesome alternative to ice-cream or frozen yogurt. 

Crazy good flavors. Never disappointed. I may need a second job to support my Tasti D-lite habbit. Well worth it people.

Robert Pfeifer. Drive thur seem very nice lol thanks for the food id recommend to anyone in this area for a lunch dinner or a snack. They got everything for fish sandwiches burgers and salads to Oreo shake and Reese cup pies !!! I love it. The lobster roll and lobster and chips are great! Happy to pay $17 and $13 for each of them. It's PF Changs cheaper cousin and I actually like it much better.

I've never been a fan of Changs.  Even after running the R&R marathon and getting various coupons and deals, which had us eating there several times, I never bonded at all.

Not so at Pei Wei.  

I like their food, it's hot and fresh, there is a nice selection to choose from, and the value is there.. We used Best Storage to rent a Penske truck for a local move and they were efficient, friendly, and quality. The truck was in shape and fully-fueled, the customer service was great, and the staff got us in and out very quickly.  I'd recommend them if you need to rent a moving vehicle.. I guess that before this place opened it was another taco place that wasn't that good. NOT THE SAME PLACE.

I stumbled upon this place  at the end of a run through Madison, and went inside to check it out.  It was a great find, and easily the best burrito I have ever had (braised beef burrito- wet). 

Everything is made in house and is farm to table. They process their own meat and grow their own vegetables. I came back with my wife, and she loved the veggie chimichanga. Fresh kale, pickled radish, it's really an amazing meal. Make sure to get house made chips and guacamole, queso or salsa. 

I highly recommend this place, bring your appetite and don't miss out!. I have been a fan of the Eastside Aces & Ales for a few years now, but only make it out that way on very rare occasions. This was my first time at the Westside location, which is far closer to my normal stomping grounds.

I arrived with another beer snob friend, who had also not yet visited this location, and we were immediately greeted by a very friendly waitress. She provided us with some suggestions on both food and beer. We did not take her up on the food (she did mention that the pizza oven was not yet installed), but did take her up on the beer.

There are 50 taps available, and I only saw one that was not craft (Blue Moon). The selection is very diverse with different styles and different breweries. I didn't immediately notice the size of servings on the beer menu, so I was a bit shocked when I didn't get a pint of my first beer. 

After having 3 beers (the Joseph James Citra Rye was my favorite of the evening) and receiving our bill, we noticed that all the beers we had were $6/each.

I really liked that the place is still new so I didn't walk out smelling like smoke. The staff was really friendly and the clientele was pretty low-key, which is exactly what I am looking for in a good beer bar.

I will definitely be back for the amazing beer selection and the delightful ambiance.. Came here for breakfast. It is clean inside and the person at the counter seemed nice.  Got the spicy burrito with double meat ham and sausage.
It was delicious!!
If I wsn't from out of town, I'd come back here for lunch! !  

I definitely recommend this place!. Las Vegas, you have a treasure.  This place should be front and center. Get your asses in and try it!. Had a great time here watching the Smashing Pumpkins. The venue may not be ideal for watching a concert due to some challenging sight lines.  However, we managed to have a great time... Until we got asked to leave for doing head stands.  Namaste.. Went there for lunch last Saturday and the place was packed.  I sat at the bar and ordered a beer, of which they have plenty to choose.  The bartender was friendly and called me by name, even though I'd never met her.  I ordered the Western Burger cooked Medium Well with Tater Tots.  Even though they were busy the food came out fairly quick.  The burger was juicy and had a lot of flavor and the Tater Tots were crisp.  They have plenty of TVs throughout the dining area with everything from College Basketball to Racing.  

This is maybe the fourth time I've been and every experience has been good.  The service is always top notch and the food is on point.  THIS IS THE BEST BURGER PLACE IN CHARLOTTE.. Great burgers, friendly staff, unlimited fries and open late. What more could you ask for?. Fully alive is incredibly creative, professional and well priced! I couldn't have asked for a better photographer.. My first visit to this Starbucks and I liked it. A community table in addition to many 2-person tables and patio seating (too hot/humid to enjoy in August). Another successful by-the-book Starbucks.. Die Buchhandlung Thalia ist wirklich beeindruckend. Man bekommt was das herz begeht und sollte ein Buch nicht da sein sind die Mitarbeiter sehr bemüht es so schnell wie möglich zu beschaffen. 
Die Buchhandlung erstreckt sich auf drei Etagen und ist gut aufgeteilt. Es gibt auch ein paar Sitzmöglichkeiten um im ausgewählten Buch zu stöbern.. This is my first time eating at Tofu Hut. My friend and I got the tripe, boneless chicken thigh, brisket, rib eye and beef tongue and they were all good. The place lacks in customer service but if you don't really care for customer service and just want a cheap all you can eat restaurant then this is for you.. I've stayed at South Point for the last couple CES conventions.  Previously, we had dined at Silverado and enjoyed the experience, so we returned again this year.  This go around, I have the filet with mashed potatoes, before were very delicious.  I also has a salad for starters with a champagne vinaigrette dressing -- this dressing was awesome!   If you are staying at the hotel, you also get a (house) bottle of wine with your meal (with coupon)  -- I was expecting this to be a low-quality wine, but I really enjoyed the taste and would even buy it for home use (I think it was Rodney Strong).   Great service as well!. I did NOT realize that this was a 18+ show until I picked up and read the fine print on my ticket ...

WARNING: Please skip the show if you cannot handle any of the following items:

- Can't tolerate stereotypical racist / sexist jokes
- Can't accept profanity / vulgar languages
- Can't handle sexual innuendos

What made this show worth the money: 1st - seating, seating, and seating! Unlike some other shows where you are literally sitting 100+ feet away from the actual performance, this is a very intimate setting and pretty much any seats can give you a great view. You can get to witness the incredible acrobatics close up in person. 

What to expect: Expect audience participation (15%), ridiculously vulgar (or witty) stand-up comedy (35%), acrobatics / gymnastics (35%), and Melody Sweets' musical performance (15%). 

Yup, this was probably the most vulgar comedy show that I've ever watched (even more so than the Book of Mormon). If you can set your mind free (as one of the Yelper wrote - getting buzzed) and having that  "I don't give a damn" attitude, then this could potentially be one of the best Vegas show experience. 

P.S. - Definitely one of the more expensive show - expect at least $100 per ticket.. Tough golf course if your not hitting it straight.  The smallest offline hit puts you in a canyon or desert.  Still course condition is great.  Practice facilities great.  Stall great.  Good course but not for beginners.. I tried the tasting menu and it was worth the $$$$.  Wagu steak. Scallops and dessert. I also had the absynthe.  You must try it.  the waiter was a little slow and condescending but it was fine, I was hammered on absynthe and purple dragon who cares.. This place is great! Amazing flavor combinations and great service! Cold weather or Hot, you can't deny the warm atmosphere. Love it, will always come back!. So had too try another local style 808 because REALLY can never get enough local food in life!! It amazing thinking about close twenty years ago first moved Vegas could count with two hands local style restaurants in the Valley outside of downtown (California Hotel). Now too many too keep track of and talk about competitive market. The best part is not only competitive but spread across the Valley and blessed think now have few options in my area. Kauai Cafe is the latest one. It just recently opened so the signage out front is work in progress. Never judge book from its cover because once you get inside feeling the Aloha spirit and literally family run business (The dad/son run the kitchen; his daughter runs the front). Decor inside tell Hawaii pride from the Hawaii state flag and kealii reichel pictures. If you from Hawaii know who Kealii Reichel.

The food since first time not sure what I wanted but ended up going for the Kalua Pork Poor Boy with Portuguese bean soup for my side. I ordered side of fried noodles just because wanted try more...The Portuguese bean soup was good. Talk about hearty soup. So much of the good stuff Portuguese sausage, noodles, beans, and vegetables quite literally one spoonful of broth. The fried noodles I could have just had whole plate of noodles. Just like back home with the charsu action, the noodles, and great sauce. The Kalua Pork Poor Boy talk about mean sandwich. I had my reservations because Kalua Pork is Kaiua Pork and Cabbage. I happy that went outside the box. It stole the show, The Kalua Pork was nice moist, topped with bbq sauce, and the citrus walnut slaw brought it all together. I know might thinking pulled pork sandwich but I felt like nothing like it. Sure sandwich would order again again.

The staff or family truly exemplifies the aloha spirit. John the dad presence very much felt outside talking too customers. He checked up on me next thing know talking stories about they use too run same place in small town outside of Seatttle, WA. Got tired of the weather whole family moved too Vegas. His son is the chef of the kitchen, daughter takes care of the front of the house, and his daughter best friend one of the servers. Truly not only feel the aloha spirit, just the passion they have for the food, and making it authentic local food. Also like is signature dishes that will make return visit. It authentic but with their own touch. The portion sizes any other local plate nice size and nothing more bang for your buck then local food. 

Without doubt will be coming back because lot more local food need too try at Kauai Cafe.. I'd give it 5 stars but the oysters were bad... really bad. Ambiance is really cool in a retro way and the prime rib was superb. The staff is attentive and reminiscent of old school American steak restaurants from Chicago or NY. If you're looking to drop some dough on a good steak dinner with more character than Morton's or Fleming's, this is your place.. Excellent atmosphere for a margarita and some yummy tacos. Right across the street from the Wynn and Encore, this place is an easy stop on your way out of town. I stopped here after a long stay in Vegas before driving home to California and I was very full! Portion size is large and very filling. Ordered the bottomless chips for an appetizer. Came with pico de gallo, salsa verde and a delicious smokey chipotle salsa. The chips and dips had me full before my entree arrived. For lunch I had the baja shrimp taco platter. The dish comes with delicious cilantro rice and black beans. I really loved the rice, as I am a huge cilantro fan. The black beans were solid and also tasty. The corn tortillas were sweet and soft, the platter came with five small corn tortillas, a nice large portion of fried shrimp and a green avocado/lime sauce as well as a chipotle crema. My only complaint is that I wish the shrimp had not been fried...there was too much batter on the shrimp and it did not add anything to the dish. Just freshly sauteed lime shrimp would have been much nicer. My partner's salmon tacos were also delicious and our friend's chimichanga was very very large, so large, he was unable to finish it. This place is not going to win any food awards for being authentic mexican, however it was very good, prices were decent for the strip and portion sizes were large. Atmosphere was fun, we sat near the bar, outside, with plenty of people watching.. Found this little coffee & tea shop at random while perusing Yelp for nearby options one lazy Saturday. Totally unassuming structure; you've gotta be looking for this place or you'll drive right by it. **After having visited, I need to say: DON'T DRIVE RIGHT BY IT!!

I couldn't be happier with my experience here. Walking through the front door, you're met with a gentle whiff of spices - not quite what the olfactory brain expects, but pleasant and surprising nonetheless.

The barista was a sweet young woman named Maria. Turns out, she was still pretty new to the job, but her demeanor and willingness to help coupled with her excitement to be working here was evident, and contagious.

I ordered a "Traditional Coffee Ceremony" for the first time ever. (The ceremony serves two.) The coffee took some time to prepare, but I expected this. When it came to the table, it was served by the owner, Aisha Tedros, on a tray.

The coffee had been brewed in an authentic clay pot with a neck stuffed full of what Aisha referred to as "a natural filter made from the palm tree". It was set on the tray alongside two small tea cups, a clay container holding white sugar, and another small clay container holding herbs and spices.

The herbs and spices were scooped into another little saucer containing hot coals to incite a lovely and calming incense, then the coffee was poured through the palm-tree-filter over a tiny spoonful of white sugar in each tea cup.

The experience of the coffee was equally satisfying.

I stayed for quite some time, making myself at home with the delicious coffee and some phenomenal homemade baklava. Both Aisha and Maria checked up on me regularly, even taking the time to get to know more about me personally, which I really really enjoyed.

This will absolutely NOT be the last time I venture out to this wonderful location and I fully intend to introduce all my friends to this truly fascinating experience. There are very few places that induce such a sense of calm in me - A.T. Oasis genuinely surprised me.

Made my day. Go see for yourself sometime soon!  :). Come early.  If you get there for dinner by about 4:30 you should not have much problem getting in - I would guess the same is true for lunch.  My new favorite is their loaded baked potato.  I didn't see it on the menu, so I asked the wait person after seeing other people eating them.  They said, "sure we have those - do you want butter (yes), sour cream (yes), chives (oh yeah), and cheese (yes, yes, yes) on it?  I eat the entire potato, skin and all.  My friends usually get the steaks, and they say the steaks are very good.  I have had the hamburger, and you can put all the usual stuff on it ... onions, lettuce, tomato, etc.  Great place to eat!. So if you're a fan of soup and even more of a fan of choosing your own ingredients, this is definitely the spot to check out.  First off in terms of the ambiance, this is not a restaurant that even looks like it belongs here in Phoenix.  This has that cool East coast or LA low key yet high end type of feel.  Great place to take a date if you want a fun dining experience.
The broth selection was excellent from the spicy and lemon grass broths to the flavorful curries.  Then there's the extended menu and the bountiful ingredients.  Choose you own adventure and truly it is one.  Pork belly was amazing and I would advise (if you like seafood) getting the shrimp and clams especially for the curry.  I'll probably try out the Waygu beef next time.  Even the veggie selection is great for those non meat lovers and don't forget to get the enoki mushrooms. 
Food was great, atmospherewas great and to top it off the staff was very friendly.  I'd go here again for sure even when it hits 100 + in temps.
Next adventure will be its sister company Red Thai. Again, another out of the box concept by the chef and owner.  You'll need to check that out as well cuz it's a trip.  First thing you see is a large wall with Japanese anime playing throughout.  Must see and must experience!!!. Bulwark has been the only pest control company that we have used since building our house in 2002.  No reason to shop around for other companies when we get such great service from Bulwark.  Our tech, Pam McCubbin, always does an excellent job and shows sincere interest in making sure that we are well taken care of.. Great neighborhood sports bar.  They've got something like 35 HD TV's  all arranged so you can get a good view no matter where you sit.  The staff is friendly, drinks are inexpensive (like $10.00 for 1 beer and 2 vodka/soda), and their food is tasty.  They have a large comfy outdoor seating area if you want to catch some fresh air.

My only complaint about this place is on the weekends they usually have a cover band... not that the band is terrible or anything (i think they switch it up so it's  not always the same band anyway), but they're loud and if you're there to watch a game, forget about hearing anything relating to the game, including the people you are with.  I can see how this could go either way with people since it does add kinda a rockin' environment, which is nice, depending on your mood.

Oh and they have those satellite speaker things so you have this box at your table and you can tune the sound to whichever game you're interested in listening to, not that it matters when the band is playing, but every other time it's cool.. Great pizza ,hoagies and wings. Staff are super nice and helpful. The place is clean and I frequent here a lot .Good bottled beer selection, enough of the dogfish head though, there are so many others out there that I'm bored with them. Draft list is always solid but I'd like to see more balance of ipa vs browns or stouts. I tell people to eat here all the time. Keep up the good work!. Looking for a cool place to go downtown before a class my fiance have to go to. We decided on the Roosevelt because 1. it has beer and 2. we like the idea of a house in the historical district being converted into a restaurant. 

We walked in and were immediately impressed with the decor, and even music playing. We sat at the bar that wasn't crowded at all and looked at the Happy Hour menu. We got some beer that we had never heard of and ordered their Giant Pretzel, and a Chicken Pesto sandwich (wasn't on the menu) and they were both fantastic, we split both but we would have been full if we only got one. 

Overall the beer selection was pretty cool, I only took a quick peek at the wine menu, looked pretty good too but I'm not a wine snob I only like red wine that doesn't hurt the wallet. 

The only thing not giving it 5 stars is that the service was excellent, except that everyone that comes here seems to be very regular so they got caught up in conversation when we were trying to get and pay our tab. It wasn't anything to make you angry but it just took a little too long, especially when you are on a time limit.

I would love to come here again with some friends when we are downtown again. I have already told a bunch of people they need to try it out. It's best to carpool because parking isn't very abundant.. This was my second time eating at cut. Once again settings is very elegant. The service was spectacular. We went with another couple who ordered bone in ribeye. The hitting the top sirloin bone in ribeye the last time ( their be expensive option). I did not find it nearly as good last time we ate here. My family stay to be ordinary not special. I get a Bernese sauce on it was excellent. However last time we were here the steak was of such qualities it is not needed. The vegetables on the side where at standing. Awkward to play with also really outstanding. I guess my take home message is to order the expensive cut at this restaurant rather than d least expensive. Still it was a wonderful dining experience.. I like this little club. It appears to be a small club in a strip mall next to the Horse & Hound, but inside it is very spacious. The club brings in a good mix of local artists and larger known performers. I saw KRS-One here in 2009 and Slick Rick here yesterday. Security is smooth - I typically pre-purchase my tickets and have no trouble getting in the building quickly. Both times I have been the show was pushed back an hour, but once it started it was great. It gives the local acts a chance to get their name out there. 

Yesterday I didn't purchase alcohol (I pre-limed elsewhere), but I bought an energy drink. Actually I bought two because there is a $10 limit on charge cards and the drink was $4. A couple of bartenders there to keep it moving. 

The sound is good, but the thing I like most is that while it is overall very roomy, it is also a venue where you can get up close to the performers.  I would recommend seeing a show here. Most are about $20 and tickets are easily purchased online. They have a web site, but the videos and photos show they are not always updated. I think if they had an improved web site that included recent pics, videos and upcoming schedule, it would be great. There is a calendar of events, but it could be improved.. Very professional excellent service and the right price.. Not the best hotel, but by far not the worst. Awesome location, close to just about anything you want to do in the city. Prices were good for everything the hotel offers. Good breakfast buffet in the morning, get there early.  Rooms are large with enough room to sleep 3 men for a long weekend. Rooms included a kitchenette w/ a full size fridge.
Parking may seem kind of sketchy in the under ground garage, but I've never issues and $25 CDN a day is a fair price.
Never used the pool.
Mikasa (Japanese) and Cavalli (Italian) are both top notch restaurants just outside the front door.. I returned to Las Vegas and the Golden Steer, this time for a bachelor party.  We had a party of 12 which was booked through Open Table.  We had to make a few changes with the time and the number in our party and they were very accommodating.

On arrival, they put us in a private room in the back, which was a nice surprise.  We were told that this was the room used by the "bosses" back in the day who had to come in and out through the back door.  

We had a team of servers including the Robert DeNiro impersonator that hangs around.  We started out with the the seafood appetizer which was a mix of shrimp, oysters, crab, etc.  All of which was fresh and delicious.  

This time, I went with the New York Strip which was cooked to perfection, as expected.  Out of all 12 in our group, there was not a single complaint and compliments all around.

The price tag is steep, but worth it.  Everything was great down to the food and the service.  A must do in Vegas if you are a meat connoisseur. This place reminds me of Chipotle Mexican Grille but with Hawaiian twist.  Very clean well-lit, comfortable atmosphere.  The staff is friendly, and the food selection is simple but tasty.  The real hidden gem in this place is the coconut bark dessert.  I normally don't order dessert anywhere, but due to the staff's friendly persuasion, I tried it and loved it.. I was gonna go 3 stars on this, but they've got some good eats in here, so let's call it 3.5, OK?

Self-parking for check-in is a breeze. Stop trying to find a space on level 1 and go up a few so that you can park right next to an elevator. 

Check-in was slow and laborious. I can't believe in 2013 people still have to clack a thousand and one keys to confirm the reservation I already paid 50% of online. There should be a service where you can book a specific room online, show up with your credit card, slide it in the lock and BOOM you're in. Who wants to deal with some chipper chick doing her worst to get you checked in fast after a 5 hour drive to Vegas? 

The rooms are decent. At least, ours was. I'm sure they get better. We had a pretty good view of some mountains. It's not like you're getting a strip view anywhere here, so might as well just get whatever is available for the right price. The mini bar and counter bar are scary because if you even knock something out of it by accident you're charged automatically. And, yes, the prices are grossly inflated. 

The bathrooms blow. Our sink, which I thought was cool because it had a super deep basin, was not cool because that super deep basin filled up every time we used it. Ditto on the shower, which at one point filled so much I might as well have taken a bath. Plus, how the hell am I supposed to wash myself AND pee in the shower when it's up to my calves? Seriously, guys. 

I liked their sexually suggestive door hangers - turn it to "Tied Up" if you don't want the maid. Which we did, often. But she still came anyway. I assume they just ignore them. 

As I said, between Pink Taco, Mr. Lucky's 24/7, Culinary Dropout and whatever else you come across this hotel has some good foodstuffs. And clearly at least one of them is open 24 hours. 

The fitness center was closed for AVN Awards (No, I did not go because I arrived the day after it occurred. Yes, that did upset me.), so I got directed up to the cardio room. Which is exactly that - a room full of cardio eq. Of course, since the gym was temporarily closed I was welcome to use the spa's gym facility... for a reduced-from-$25-a-day, $10/day fee. So, had their own gym been open it's free, but since it isn't I get to pay a reduced fee of $10? Well, fuck me, isn't that a deal?

Check out didn't work on my TV for whatever reason. Luckily, doing it down at the lobby is a breeze. No hassle or waiting or whatever. Why can't they make it this easy to get into the place?. Shane's is awesome. I usually order the Shack Sampler. It's a WHOLE lot of food. The ribs fall off the bone and their chicken tenders are great. I come here at least twice a month. I've tried all the sauces and haven't been disappointed by any....the fried okra sux tho.. Sweet Tomatoes is BACK and better than ever!

Field kitchen was an absolute nightmare and disaster. Many guests including ourselves voiced our opinion and Sweet Tomatoes listened. That alone shows you this is a great company.

We have been long time fans of Sweet Tomatoes and before, the food was very yummy. After their Field Kitchen trial and return back to their original, their food has become delicious! There are more choices on the salad bar (LOVED the sliced apple), blueberry muffins are bigger and tastier, soda machine is updated, and everything else just tastes better.

Sweet Tomatoes has really stepped up their game and I cannot see any business in the area compete with them. On top of the great food and reasonable price, the staff is just so helpful and friendly. Everyone smiles and says hello, goodbye, thank you, etc. This experience was so great that the wife and I ALMOST went back the next day!

Go in to eat, visit, and relax. I would give them 6 stars if I could.. Thatch roof sundae. Vanilla ice cream, chocolate fudge and chocolate almonds. Tried something new today instead of my usual Kauai Pie and was not disappointed. Now I have two favorite flavors!. Funky spot next to art district.  Most interesting thing about their food is the appetizers. Hot stone for cooking your own thin sliced beef.  The sushi is good & atmosphere enjoyable, we brought our 3 year old &  it was a bit of a challenge on a busy Friday night.. Actually good food for a decent price,  Mongolian grill was excellent,  only tried the chicken choices in the buffet,  fresh and cooked well. Service was ok,  entire restaurant was well maintained,  no funny odors just fresh food.  Nice selection of desserts also...  Definitely will visit in the future,  highly recommend. Best  happy hour in town!!!  Great service and food ! Friendliest bar tenders in Vegas !. This review is all about the $5.95 lunch special.  Lunch is served from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.  

What do you get for that money?  Well, the lunch menu has over 50 dishes to choose from, that include two kinds of soup, choice of fried or white rice, choice of crab rangoon or a small egg roll, and refillable soft-drinks.  

I ordered the beef panang.  It's not the tastiest panang I've ever had, but referring back to the price for the whole meal, and the ample portion, I was pleased.  I had a decent portion of beef, mixed with carrots, onions, bell peppers and the panang sauce.  Mixed with a nice scoop of rice, I couldn't finish the meal.  My wife had Mongolian beef.  She complained that it wasn't spicy enough, and indicated that it was more like a teriyaki beef.  I think that if she asked them to spice it up, they'd be willing to put enough chiles and peppers to make her nose run.  

Concerning the overall environment and service, we were quickly seated upon arrival in a comfortable booth.  There was a plasma TV with CNN on the wall.  The service was prompt and attentive.  The place was quite clean and suitable for dining.. Real, "michigan style" coney dog!  From the chili to the vienna style weeny.  Havent tried anything else on their menu, however i dont really see a need to.  

Suckin on chili dawgs
Outside the DCG....!. Very good food. 
I wish the beer selection was a little better. 
We have been here 2 times and were very happy with each visit.
Looking forward to going back.. Olivier is the very best, and his skills and friendliness added with the finest illy supplied arabica beans makes Baguette Cafe the very best coffee shop. 

The location is hard to find due to it being in a business park. But it is like a hidden gem or a treasure. Once you have found the shop, the rewards are worth it. 

Think about it... walking into a friendly warm atmosphere with fresh croissant and coffee aroma in the air then greeted by the most friendly coffee shop owner ever then enjoying a nice cup of illy coffee or a small parisian meal, life is so beautiful. 

I have been to sunrise and sambalatte and sunrise was my favorite before but as it is growing, I feel less connection with the coffee shop (I believe coffee shops should provide not only delicious coffee, but also interaction and lifestyle). I found Baguette cafe from a friends recommendation and now it is the only place I would go for coffee. (oh and sambalatte... they are always too crowded for the barista or cashier's interaction, they feel cold and cocky)

Nice coffee + nice atmosphere + the very best owner/barista. What more can you ask for?

100/5 rating.

P.S. Everything on the menu is delicious (from quiches to soups). Even though they lost our reservation and were crowded, they served us well with great food, Braised Short Ribs were outstanding, with three different pasta dishes just plain SUPER!. Dr. O'Tool is an awesome person and doctor! I am happy I finally found a doctor I can stick with for a while. The office staff is very friendly and welcoming. My whole family goes to her and we are all really happy!. Recommended to us by the concierge at Le Westin. 
One of the better meals I have ever had.
Braised short rib served with lobster, peach slices,and veggies was incomparable. The chef made me a beautiful salad as an app even though salad was not on the menu. 
Everything our party ordered was beautifully prepared and presented. 
Our server, Naomi, was so pleasant and helpful. She even wrote down some of her personal favorite spots for breakfast and lunch in Montreal. 

Don't be concerned about slightly sketchy looking block this restaurant is on or it's very unassuming entrance. This is a restaurant capable of preparing a memorable meal.. Wonderful massage!  Amachele has great fingers and you can tell she really cares.. Pork bulgogi is good.
Food is spicy. 3 star, for example, means heat.. Love this place. Great service. Huge portions. Love that I never have to ask for a refills on drinks. Every dish I've ever had at this great place has been delish.  I'm hooked. We go here at least once a month. Faves: Lemon chicken & Mongolian beef. Dang...it's almost 10pm and now I'm craving China Chili!!!!. this location is pretty good the steaks are cooked right and the food is consistent. Really not as good as other chain restaurants in its price range but ok for a different country feel.. Really a pleasant surprise.  It is located right in downtown Las Vegas.  It a very detailed museum of the mob from the Las Vegas point of view.  I have been a follower of the mob for years.  The museum was really detailed on the Kefauver hearings.  Really informative and logically set up.  Check in on Yelp and get a discount.. I love this bar. The staff is very friendly and personable.  I'm always greeted by everyone there from the front door, to the waitstaff, and the management.  As popular as this place has gotten, they've managed to keep it personal.  The atmosphere is great.  I've never had anything off the menu that I didn't like, and there are many choices of craft brews to pick from (There's always something new to try!)

SanTan Brewery is the reason that Downtown Chandler is what it is today.  Before they opened, Downtown was a ghost town most days.  On Sunday, the entire area was shut down.  Now the area is packed, and many other bars and restaurants have come in.  You can go to Downtown Chandler and stay there the whole night and not get bored.  SanTan is also responsible for bringing most of the events to Downtown Chandler, like the St Patrick's Day Party, Oktoberfest, The RibFest, and the Chandler tree lighting wouldn't be as popular if there weren't so many new businesses there.. Came here after eating at Bachi Burger. Nice selection of "old" and new candies. Wide selection of sodas, regional stuff along with old national brands. Brings back memories. If I lived here or was staying longer I would've tried some of the sodas....next time. 

Couldn't leave without getting some pop rocks and double bubble gum!. I never really understood the appeal and pervasiveness of the "Friday night fish fry".  Thanks to Wikipedia I now know that they began as a response to Catholic restrictions on eating meat on Fridays.  But outside of religious reasons I can't see why someone would get excited over something you can get anytime at Long John Silvers or your favorite fish & chips joint.

So, when I came here super-hungry on a Friday night, the main reason spurring me to order the fish was the promise of it being "all-you-can-eat".  I was taken aback when the 1st plate came out at how big, golden and crunchy the fish was.  I'm really picky about how fish is prepared, and this was perfect.  The sides were good, too, everything tasted fresh and the portions were big.

After my first plate I was getting pretty full, and wondered if I should have ordered the normal fried fish plate, but it tasted so good I couldn't stop!  I think I had 2 more plates...

Everything about the visit was great.  Our server was attentive and friendly.  The atmosphere was bright yet cozy.  The food was delicious and plentiful.  The prices are very reasonable.  I'll definitely have to come back.

NOTE:  The hours they have posted on their website seem to be outdated, but I think the ones shown on the menu are accurate.. It's kinda pricey but always clean. Employees seem to be friendly enough. They offer good selection of better ingredients. Kinda wish they would bring back the cheap deli chicken specials!. We went to see a concert (One Republic) and it was a great concert venue; the Drinks were ok, but it's a great place to see a band you like.. I love Vegas, atmosphere is cool, hotels look awesome at night, great place to go with a group to drink gamble and have fun. Pools everywhere which is nice and tons of great restaurants. I come here 3-4 ti es a year and have fun each time. As I sit here and write this review I am now wanting to go back to Vegas already even though I was already there last month.. For the money that you are paying, Roberto's Taco Shop offers a sufficient quantity and has a very consistent quality from my past experiences. Although Roberto's is good when sober, but it is most definitely better tipsy. 
Although the staff there can be a little bit grumpy working an overnight shift, it is a minor issue because Roberto's is virtually fast-food and does not require too much service.. Charged 2.50 for delivery , food was made with fresh ingredients, slight mis step in communication of weather to hold the onions or not.  Pad won seen was excellent!  Eat here!. Best tacos in Scottsdale,great location and ambiance cant wait to go back and try the other items on the menu,My only complaint would be the lack of complimentary Chips and salsa,that something I tend to expect at a mexican restaurant,But that aside highly recommended. One of the few studios in the Valley that take and transmit the practice of yoga as a practice of conscious living. I really like Laughing Buddha and the atmosphere in here. The studio is really spacious, I love that it has some plants inside..Staff is super nice, warm, and welcoming, classes are 1.5 hours!! Prices are pretty reasonable and there are lots of donation-only classes and part of their profits goes to Tumbleweed. I have taken classes with Dusty and Robin, pretty adequate for all practitioners from beginners to advanced... Saturdays at 4pm is my favorite!. Do not walk by!!! Go in to eat here. Delicious!! We stayed at the Venetian for 3 nights and while shopping I kept walking by. Finally I had a craving for spaghetti and meatballs....oh baby baby wow!! From the garlic rolls dripping with olive oils ad garlic, to the house salad, to our spaghetti (mine with meatballs, the other with clams). Given how expensive meals can be in Vegas, we averaged $100 each meal while here, our check was a surprising $75 including two glasses of wine. Yeah!! Now i can get my revenge on the blackjack tables.. This place was really great.  Brought the Mrs. here for her birthday date.  Made reservations ahead of time but even so on a Saturday it was packed! They asked us to wait a couple minutes but that was no problem cuz it gave me a minute to grab a drink from the bar.  The bar was packed but the bartender still got to me a couple seconds after I walked up.  Food was really good.  Anyone who goes here has got to get the table side guacamole. It was awesome. And despite how great the food was, it wasn't back breaking.  Perfect place for a special occasion or date night.. No apologies here - I'm a giant KISS fan, so of course this rates high!

To be honest, the course was really nice.  It's in great shape and the hole layouts are unique.  I loved the music (executed well by a DJ with shout-outs to groups in attendance) and the black-light atmosphere.  Our group took our time during the round - checking out the layout of each hole and calculating what the best shots would be.  Our friends ahead of us blew through the course, but I think we had more fun really soaking it in.  We didn't slow things down - the groups behind us were several holes behind and never rode our heels.

The gift shop was decent, but lacked some of the quick/easy gifts to pick up just to say "yeah, I was there".  Key chains for $15 didn't seem reasonable, even for Vegas...even for KISS...  The autographed memorabilia was sweet - and yes, they'll ship it for you.

The staff were great to our group - very courteous and helpful.  Even the non-KISS fans in the group had fun.. Split  a couple of dishes and dessert with my friend. First and foremost my favorite item was the pineapple fried rice (came with Chicken, Raisins, Nuts, Pineapple) which was made spicy, the combination of the spices and the pineapple makes me want to come here again. Also got a noodle dish called the pad key mew w/ tofu that was pretty good and spicy enough for my tasting, but my friend recommended to get it Thai Spicy if your into that. Finished up with sticky rice w/ mango and a Thai Iced Tea... Get there while you can.  Oh yeah and their music was killing it, Tracy Chapman, Shawn Colvin, Men at Work, some 90's shit.. The atmosphere there is great, the food is pretty simple but tastey. I go there for their wine. It really is a great selection and the staff is pretty knowledgeable. I had the tuna sandwich for the first time the other day, cause I normally get the brushetta(sp?) and it was really good. It wasn't mayonnaise-ey. I would also recommend the nine iron.. I went just the other day and they are still rocking out great Mexican American food. The service is fast and friendly. This is not authentic Mexican it's what I grew up on and it's very good. They have great chicken tacos, great quesadillas. Double plus good!!!. By far the only true Italian food in Las Vegas.  This place beats any high end Italian restaurant on the STRIP. I'm born in raised in Manhattan and this is as good as it gets. Decent sandwiches.
